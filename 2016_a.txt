                                                   Abstract
      This paper analyzes the reasons for differences in the effect of retirement on health estimated
      results in previous studies. We investigate these differences by focusing on the analysis methods
      used by these studies. Using various health indexes, numerous researchers have examined the
      effects of retirement on health. However, there are no unified views on the impact of retirement
      on various health indexes. Consequently, we show that the choice of analysis method is one of the
      key factors in explaining why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health differ.
      Moreover, we re-estimate the effect of retirement on health by using a fixed analysis method
      controlling for individual heterogeneity and endogeneity of the retirement behavior. We analyze
      the effect of retirement on health parameters, such as cognitive function, self-report of health,
      activities of daily living (ADL), depression, and body mass index in eight countries. We find
      that the effects of retirement on self-report of health, depression, and ADL are positive in many
      of these countries.

1    Introduction

    Retirement related policies, such as pension system reform, have become important for developed

countries to sustain their social security systems. Numerous developed countries have faced the

same problems of a decreasing birthrate and an ageing population. As population ages, the cost

of social security and social welfare increases, eroding the country’s budget. As such, developed

countries have reformed their pension systems to reduce the cost of social security and social welfare.

Moreover, many developed countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Korea

have already decided to increase pension eligibility age for the next decades. Japan has already

increased the pension eligibility age. These pension reforms in developed countries are expected to

delay retirement. As Gruber and Wise (1998) discuss, the relationship between the social security

system and retirement in developed countries generated a lot of attention in economics. When

policy makers evaluate the effect of these reforms, health is a key factor. If working is beneficial for

the health of the elderly, it would lead to reduced medical expenses and vice-versa.

    Along with a growing interest in the effect of these retirement delaying policies, a number of

studies have investigated the relation between retirement and health over the last two decades. 1)

Using various health indexes, numerous researchers have examined the relationship between health

and retirement. To the best of our knowledge, Kerkhofs and Lindeboom (1997) is one of the first

papers suggesting endogenous decisions between retirement and health, and identifying the effect

of retirement on health. They find that the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) health index can

be improved after early retirement in the Netherlands by applying FE methods. Lindeboom et al.

(2002) extend Kerkhofs and Lindeboom (1997) study to other indices such as the mini-mental state

examination (MMSE) test on cognitive ability, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression

(CES-D) test of depressing feelings, and others, and apply FE methods to Dutch data different

from that of Kerkhofs and Lindeboom (1997).2) Charles (2004) is also one of the first investigations

that analyze the causal effect of retirement on health focusing on subjective well-being (SWB) in

economic literature by using instrumental variables (IVs).

    Additionally, there are numerous other papers that study the effect of retirement on various

health indexes (e.g., Bound and Waidmann, 2007; Coe and Lindeboom, 2008, Dave, Rashad, and


                                                   2


Spasojevic, 2008; Neuman, 2008; Johnston and Lee, 2009; Latif, 2011; Coe and Zamarro, 2011;

Kajitani, 2011; Behncke, 2012; Bonsang, Adam, and Perelman, 2012; Mazzonna and Peracchi,

2012; Hernaes et al., 2013; Bingley and Martinello, 2013; Hashimoto, 2013; Insler, 2014; Kajitani,

Sakata, and McKenzie, 2014; Hashimoto, 2015; Kajitani, Sakata, and McKenzie, 2016). There are,

however, no unified views on the impact of retirement on various health indexes. While some studies

conclude that retirement has a positive impact on health defined as mental or physical health, other

studies conclude that retirement has no or negative effect. Additionally, these results depend on

characteristics such as gender and education.

   The goal of this paper is to explain why the effect of retirement on health estimated results in the

previous studies differ. One of the keys to understanding these differences is a better understanding

of the path through which retirement influences health. If there is an important link between

retirement and health (i.e., a mechanism through which retirement influences health outcomes),

the effect of retirement on health could be heterogeneous. In fact, some researchers focus on the

change in the health investment behaviors after retirement to explain why the effect of retirement

on health estimated results in the previous studies differ (e.g., Zhao, Konishi, and Noguchi, 2013;

Ayyagari, 2014; Insler, 2014; Eibich, 2015; Motegi, Nishimura, and Terada, 2016). Eibich (2015)

is the first study to clearly point out the importance of the mechanism to explain the difference in

the effect of retirement on health. On the other hand, we investigate the differences by focusing on

the analysis methods. There is no study to focus on the analysis methods to explain why the effect

of retirement on health estimated results in the previous studies differ.3) The contribution of this

paper is to provide two verification frameworks to examine which factor causes these differences.

We will discuss which factor causes the difference in the estimated results by the previous studies.

   According to our analysis, the analysis method is one of the determinants of these differences.

By choosing an analysis methodology, we also comprehensively reexamine the effect of retirement on

health in eight countries. We analyze five health indexes, such as self-reported health, depression,

cognitive function, body mass index (BMI), and activities of daily living (ADL). We examine the

five health indexes by using the same analysis method. By doing so, we show the comprehensive

results of the effect of retirement on health.

    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews preceding studies; Section 3

discusses the data; Section 4 examines why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health

in previous studies differ from each other; Section 5 performs harmonized analysis on the effect of

retirement on health; and Section 6 concludes this paper and discusses future research scope.



2    Literature Review

    This section summarizes related studies, focusing on economic literature. As such, we introduce

studies that examine the effect of retirement on health. The study by Kerkhofs and Lindeboom

(1997) is one of the first to suggest an endogenous decision linking retirement and health regarding

the effects of retirement on health. Using a fixed effects (FE) method, they find that, in the

Netherlands, the HSCL health index can be improved after early retirement. Lindeboom et al.

(2002) examined other measurement scales, such as MMSE and CES-D, with FE methods, using

Dutch data. Charles (2004) also conducted an early investigation analyzing the causal effects of

retirement on health by focusing on SWB and through IV. Psychological and psychiatric literature

boasts a large body of research on the correlation of retirement and SWB, but has paid scant

attention to causal effects. 4)

    Furthermore, Rohwedder and Willis (2010), who investigated the effects of retirement on cogni-

tive abilities and compared micro data across the USA, the UK, and 11 European countries, found

a negative influence of retirement on cognitive abilities. They suggest that institutional differences

across countries, such as pensions, taxes, and disability policies, are also important in explaining

the differences in health outcomes across countries. As such, Rohwedder and Willis (2010) gave an

impetus to research on the effect of retirement on cognitive abilities, making possible studies such

as those by Bonsang et al. (2012), Mazzonna and Peracchi (2012), Coe et al. (2012), and Bingley

and Martinello (2013). Additionally, numerous other studies assessed the effects of retirement on

other aspects of health.   5)   Finally, Tables A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3, and A.2.4 in section A.2 show a

summary of relevant studies, chosen based on the following criteria:

    • We chose all papers analyzing the effect of retirement on health that have been published by

      November 2015. We used Google Scholar to identify these research papers.

                                                   4


    • We choose all working papers that have more than 50 citations on Google Scholar by November

      2015.

    We restrict our analysis to only papers in economics, thus excluding literature on public health.

In Tables A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3, and A.2.4, we show the category of health outcome, method, the

definition of retirement, control variables information, dataset, the method of sample selection, and

the surveyed country. Here, “positive” means the positive impact on a health status (better after

retirement), “negative” means a negative impact worse after retirement, and “no” means no impact.

According to Tables A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3, and A.2.4, there is no unifying result in all health indexes

except the health index, which only a few studies analyze. Numerous studies analyze CES-D,

self-report of health, ADL, and cognitive functioning. According to Tables A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3, and

A.2.4, the datasets such as the HRS, the SHARE and the ELSA have been frequently used. The

fixed effects method or the IV method have been typically used as the analysis method. According

to Tables A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3, and A.2.4, many studies suggest that cognitive function decreases after

retirement. In addition, many studies suggest that self-report of health improves after retirement.

However, there is no agreement in other health indexes.

    We consider why they obtain different results. We also add BMI to the analyzed indexes,

although only two studies in our list use it. This is because we comprehensively analyze the effect

of retirement on health indexes. In the Appendix A.2, we show the other indexes on illness. However,

this paper does not focus on the health indexes of illness.



3    Data

    This paper uses the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 6) and other related datasets, such

as the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), the Health Survey for England (HSE), the

Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), and the Japanese Study of Ageing

and Retirement (JSTAR). These are panel surveys of individuals 50 or older. These family datasets

are constructed so that the questions in the HRS family studies are as similar to the original ques-

tions in the HRS as possible. They include a rich variety of variables to capture living aspects in

terms of economic status, health status, family background, as well as social and work status. We

                                                  5


subsequently explain all health indexes used.



Cognitive score: We use the cognitive function score in the HRS and other related datasets. In

the HRS, we use the immediate word recall scores (first half of the word recall test), delayed word

recall (second half of the word recall test), 7) and word recall summary score (immediate word recall

plus delayed word recall). The word recall summary score is between 0 and 20. The immediate

word recall and delayed word recall tests ask the respondent to recall as many words as possible

from a list of 10 words. The score of immediate word recall and delayed word recall is the number

of words from the 10-word list that were recalled correctly.

Self-report of health: In the HRS, there is a variable that indicates self-reported health conditions.

The variable measures the categories of health self-reports as excellent, very good, good, fair, poor.

The health categories are numbered from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). In all related datasets, the

same variable is present. We convert the five values into two health statuses, poor health or not

poor health. Additionally, in the ELSA and the SHARE, we can use another scale of self-assessed

health: very good, good, fair, bad, and very bad. We also define the health self-report index of

“bad health.” 8)

ADL: This variable measures the change in the index for ADL. In the HRS and other related

datasets, all respondents are asked to answer questions such as “Because of a health or memory

problem do you have any difficulty with bathing or showering?” We use this information when

calculating the ADL score.

Depression: In the HRS, there is a question targeting whether a respondent has symptoms of

depression. For example, one of the statements is “Much of the time during the past week, you

felt depressed.” We use these questions when we calculate the CES-D score. In the HRS and

other related datasets, there are similar questions. Additionally, we use another depression scale,

EURO-D, which is available in all version of the SHARE. We mainly use the EURO-D scale in the

SHARE because the CES-D scale is only available in waves 1 and 2 of the SHARE.

BMI: In the HRS and other related datasets, all respondents are asked to provide their weight and

height, and BMI is calculated using this information. We use the value of BMI and create a dummy



                                                  6


variable that takes the value 1 if the respondent’s BMI value is greater than or equal to 30.



    We summarize all scores and values of these health indexes in Tables 1 and 2. In Table 1, we

show the descriptive statistics of the age group above 50 in all countries and the descriptive statistics

for the USA in Table 2. According to Table 1, the scores and values are not at the same level in

all countries, BMI in the US being higher than in other countries. In Table 2, we can observe

characteristics of the cognitive function. Females have a higher score than males in the word recall

summary score. Highly educated individuals have higher overall cognitive scores.

    In Section 5, we perform a dynamic analysis for selected countries. We utilize both the pension

eligibility age and the long-term variation of retirement behavior. Moreover, we choose the analyzed

countries based on the availability of information regarding pension eligibility age. We mainly

use the harmonized datasets.     9)   However, when our preferred variables are not available in the

harmonized datasets, we use the variables of the original datasets. In Table 3, we show a summary

explaining which dataset we use in Section 5 of this paper.

    More importantly, we use the pensionable age when we calculate our IVs. We explain this point

in Appendix (A.1), while in section 5, we use only the pensionable age confirmed to be correct.



4     Critical Literature Assessment

4.1   Targeted Literature

    Our goal is to explain why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health in previous

studies differ. We investigate the difference by focusing on the research framework. First, we create

pairs of related studies for each health index, based on the following criteria:


    • Step 1: We choose papers from Tables A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3, and A.2.4.

    • Step 2: We can replicate them by using the HRS, related studies (the Global Aging Data),

      and the HSE.

    • Step 3: We choose only published papers in Health Economics or Labor Economics.


                                                   7


   • Step 4: We choose only published papers that estimate a linear model to analyze the effect of

      retirement on health.

   • Step 5: We choose published papers in journals with higher impact factor as much as possible.

   Based on these criteria, we choose the studies in Table 4, which we use in the next sections. We

show how these criteria determine which paper we analyze in Appendix (A.3). In the subsequent

section, we explain how we analyze why the effect of retirement on health differs.


4.2   Verification Framework 1

   Having chosen the targeted studies, we first analyze the effect of the difference in each factor on

the final results. Each study consists of certain factors, such as surveyed country, analysis method,

retirement definition, etc. (see Table 4). These studies use various identification strategies, analysis

methods, and definitions of retirement. As such, we analyze why the estimated results of the effect

of retirement on heath in previous studies differ by focusing on the differences in these factors. In

each pair of studies, we first replace only one factor (e.g., the estimation method), as shown in

Figure 1. In section 4.3, we replace all the factors, one by one in the paired studies. In section 4.2,

by replacing only one factor, we analyze the effect of each factor on the difference in the estimated

results. There are five characteristics in each study: “index,” “def. of retire,” “controls,” “method,”

“sample,” and “survey country.” The differences in these characteristics explain the different results

on the effect of retirement on health. The details of these characteristics are as follows.

   • Index: characteristics of the index used (e.g., CES-D versus EURO-D);

   • Def. of retire: definition of retirement (e.g., retired for at least one year versus not working

      for pay);

   • Controls: What the researchers include as control variables (e.g., only family structure vari-

      ables versus family structure variables + economic variables);

   • Method: analysis method (e.g., FE methods versus IV methods);

   • Sample: sample selection method (e.g. only male versus full sample);

                                                   8


   • Survey country: surveyed country (e.g., the USA versus France).


   Here, we summarize our results.

   • The sensitivity of replacing the definition of retirement is not strong.

   • The sensitivity of replacing the analysis method is not weak. In almost all indexes, the

     estimated results change when replacing the analysis method.

   • The sensitivity of replacing the surveyed country is also significant.

   • The difference in the estimated results cannot be explained by only one-factor replacement.

   In this section, by replacing only one factor, we have checked the sensitivity of each factor on

the estimated results. We explain the details of this procedure by using an example in the results

section (Cognitive score). We show detailed results, except for the “Cognitive score” of the

verification framework 1 in section A.4. According to our results, it is difficult to explain why the

estimated results are different by replacing only one factor. In the next section, we provide another

framework to explain why the estimated results in the previous studies differ.

   In the Appendix (A.5), we summarize the replication and replacement notes in this section.

When we replicate and replace the analysis of related literature, we make some adjustments if

needed (see section A.5 for details).



Cognitive score (Bonsang et al. (2012) versus Coe and Zamarro (2011)):

   • Table 5 shows the result replacing each factor from Bonsang et al. (2012) to those in Coe and

     Zamarro (2011) and from Coe and Zamarro (2011) to those in Bonsang et al. (2012). The

     upper panel implies how the estimated results will change if we replace either the definition

     (Def. of retire), the set of control variables (Controls), the analysis method (Method), sample

     selection method (Sample), or the surveyed country (Survey country) in Bonsang et al. (2012)

     with the one in Coe and Zamarro (2011). When we replace all factors at the same time, the

     result in Bonsang et al. (2012) (-1.036) is replaced with the one in Coe and Zamarro (2011)

     (-0.120). In the method replacement from Bonsang et al. (2012) to Coe and Zamarro (2011),

                                                 9


      we only replace FE-IV (the method in Bonsang et al. (2012)) with IV (the method in Coe

      and Zamarro (2011)). In all health indexes, we perform the same analysis.

   • According to Table 5, when transplanting one factor from Bonsang et al. (2012) to Coe

      and Zamarro (2011), the replacement of the surveyed country yields the opposite results

      (negative-positive) and vice-versa. However, the sensitivity of replacing the control variables

      and the surveyed country are important.


4.3   Verification Framework 2

   In the previous section, we have discussed the sensitivity of each factor on the estimated re-

sults. We have also found that there are multiple factors that explain why the estimated results are

different. In this section, we propose another framework to explain why the estimated results are

different. As such, we start from one study and arrive at another study, replacing factors one by one

(see Figure 2). If the source of the difference in the effect of retirement on health exists, the result

will change after we change this source as per Figure 2. We discuss the results in the following.

As in verification framework 1, we explain the details of this procedure by using an example in the

results section (Cognitive score).



Cognitive score (Bonsang et al. (2012) versus Coe and Zamarro (2011)):

   • Table 6 shows the result for replacing factors one by one from Bonsang et al. (2012) to those in

      Coe and Zamarro (2011) and from Coe and Zamarro (2011) to those in Bonsang et al. (2012).

      For example, in Pattern A of Table 6, we first replace “Method,” “Controls’,’ and “Country”

      from Bonsang et al. (2012) to those in Coe and Zamarro (2011). In the second replacement,

      we further replace “Def. of Retirement.” Finally, we replace “Sample.” We perform the same

      analysis in all health indexes.

   • In Table 6, we combine method, controls, and country, as these are the factors producing the

      change in the results in Review 1. We consider that these factors are important for explaining

      the difference in the effect of retirement on health between two different studies. The figure


                                                  10


     on the left shows the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing

     the block (method + controls + country). On the other hand, the right-hand figure shows

     the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the retirement

     definition. We compare these cases as follows.

   • In all patterns (A, B, C), we observed that the estimated results change after replacing the

     block (method + controls + country) (Negative → No)(left-hand figure). On the other hand,

     we do not observe any change just after replacing the definition of retirement (right-hand

     figure).

Self-report of health (Dave et al. (2008) versus Coe and Zamarro (2011)):

   • In Table 7, we show the same procedure as in Table 6. The left-hand figure shows the change

     in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block (method + controls

     + country + index), as these factors (method + controls + country + index) produce the

     change in the results in Review 1. On the other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change

     in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the retirement definition. We

     compare these cases as follows.

   • In all patterns (A, B, C), we observed that the estimated results change after replacing the

     block (method + controls + country + index) (Negative → Positive)(left-hand figure). On

     the other hand, we do not observe any change just after replacing the definition of retirement

     except in pattern B (right-hand figure).

ADL (Dave et al. (2008) versus Neuman (2008)):

   • In Table 8, we show the same procedure as in Table 6. The left-hand figure shows the change

     in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block (method + controls),

     as these factors (method + controls) produce the change in the results in Review 1. On the

     other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change in the estimation results when we change

     the order of replacing the retirement definition. We compare these cases as follows.

   • In all patterns, changing both the estimation method and the difference in what the researcher

     uses as control variables produce a change in the results. In particular, in pattern C (left-hand

                                                 11


     figure), the change in method + controls produces the opposite impact for female samples.

     In patterns A and B, “sample” is also significant. The estimated results changes just after

     replacing “sample” (No → No (male) and Positive (female))(left-hand figure). As such, the

     definition of retirement seems to have no impact on the results (right-hand figure).

Depression (Dave et al. (2008) versus Coe and Zamarro (2011)):

   • In Table 9, we show the same procedure as in Table 6. The left-hand figure in Figure 9 shows

     the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block (method

     + controls), as these factors (method + controls) produce the change in the results in Review

     1. On the other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change in the estimation results when

     we change the order of replacing the retirement definition. We compare these cases as follows.

   • In all patterns (A, B, C), we observe that the estimated results change after replacing the block

     (method + controls) (Negative → No). In pattern D, “country + index” is also significant. The

     estimated results changes just after replacing “country + index” (Negative → No)(left-hand

     figure). On the other hand, we do not observe any change just after replacing the retirement

     definition (right-hand figure).

BMI (Johnston and Lee (2009) versus Godard (2016)):

   • In Table 10, we show the same procedure as in Table 6. The left-hand figure in Table 10

     shows the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block

     (method + controls + sample), as these factors (method + sample) produce the change in

     the results in Review 1. On the other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change in the

     estimation results when we change the order of replacing the index. There is no difference in

     the definition of retirement between Johnston and Lee (2009) and Godard (2016). Here, we

     replace the index, and compare these cases as follows.

   • In all patterns (A, B), we observe that the estimated results change after replacing the block

     (method + controls + sample) (Negative → No). In patterns C and D, “country” is also signif-

     icant. The estimated results changes just after replacing “country” (Negative → No)(left-hand


                                                 12


     figure). On the other hand, we do not observe any change just after replacing the index except

     for pattern A (right-hand figure).

   Finally, we summarize our results.


   • The choice of the estimation method seems to be the key factor for explaining the difference

     in the estimation results in all indexes. Additionally, the use of control variables is also

     important. What the researcher uses as control variables is also included in all health indexes.

     In all health indexes, the estimation method plus other factors (e.g., method + controls)

     changes in the estimation result.

   • The influence of the difference in the surveyed country is also important for explaining the

     difference in the effect of retirement on health.

   • Changes in the definition of retirement have a lower impact.


   According to our results, the difference in the estimation method is a key factor in explaining

why the estimated effects of retirement on health in preceding studies differ. It is intuitive that the

sensitivity of the surveyed country chosen is strong. However, we do not consider this as problematic.

On the other hand, a strong sensitivity of the analysis method choice is problematic because it is

possible that we do not appropriately estimate the effect of retirement on health, depending on the

choice of the analysis method. In some studies, it is possible that there remains room for further

improvement. For example, Coe and Zamarro (2011) estimate the effect of retirement on cognitive

function by using cross-sectional data. They use the exogenous variation of the pensionable age as an

IV, the SHARE being their data source. As such, we can use a dynamic variation of the retirement

behavior in the SHARE. Dave et al. (2008) only use FE and do not use an IV. Consequently, we

can use the FE-IV method, often used in recent studies to estimate the effect of retirement on

health indexes. For example, Bonsang et al. (2012), Insler (2014) and Godard (2016) use the FE-IV

method to estimate the effect of retirement on health.

5     Harmonized Analysis of the Effect of Retirement on Health

5.1   Analysis Framework

    Here, we use the FE-IV estimation method and estimate the impact of retirement on certain

health indexes for eight countries. Coe and Zamarro (2011) estimate the effect of retirement on

cognitive function by using cross-sectional data, and use the cross-country variation of pensionable

age to control for retirement endogeneity, using SHARE. However, we use a dynamic variation of

the retirement behavior, and control for retirement endogeneity by using the pensionable age in the

surveyed countries. We also estimate the effect of retirement on health indexes for each country.

While Dave et al. (2008) only use FE, we use the FE-IV method to estimate the effect of retirement

on health indexes as follows:10)




                             health indexit = β0 + β1 retireit + γ ′ xit + a1i + λ1t + ǫ1it        (1)
                                                                                     fb
                                   retireit = α0 + α1 1{ageit ≥ Aeb
                                                                 i } + α2 1{ageit ≥ Ai }

                                                    fb
         +α1 1{ageit ≥ Aeb                                         ′
                        i } · ageit + α2 1{ageit ≥ Ai } · ageit + η xit + a2i + λ2t + ǫ2i          (2)

                                         Aeb
                                          i : the early retirement benefit eligibility age

                                          Afi b : the full retirement benefit eligibility age


where retireit is an indicator which is equal to 1 when a respondent retires at period t. We use two

retirement definitions. The first is “not work for pay,” which means that a respondent is retired if

he/she is not working for payment. The second definition is “complete retire,” which is the same

retirement definition of Dave et al. (2008). λ1t and λ2t are time FE; a1i and a2i are individual FE;

xit are control variables at period t. We restrict the sample to those aged above 50.

    Our identification strategy utilizes the fact that the proportion of retired elderly in many devel-

oped countries starts to increase dramatically after the pensionable age. Pension eligibility age is

exogenous. The incentive to retire from the labor market increases after the exogenous pensionable

age. However, the pension eligibility threshold does not directly influence health status, but while



                                                   14


it increases the incentive to retire form the labor market. We exploit this fact to identify the effect

of retirement on health. 11) As such, we use dummy variables (e.g., {ageit ≥ Aeb
                                                                              i } ) and the cross

terms between the dummy variable and age (e.g., {ageit ≥ Aeb
                                                          i } · ageit ) to identify changes in retire-

ment after the pensionable age. We analyze only countries where pensionable age is confirmed to be

correct (the USA, the UK, Germany, France, Denmark, Switzerland, Czech, Estonia, Japan, China,

and Korea), and discuss how to confirm each pensionable age in Appendix (A.1). For the countries

included in the SHARE, we analyze only the surveyed countries included in the first wave (Austria,

Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and

Israel) because we utilize enough dynamic variation of retirement and health indexes. We use the

UK, Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland as the European analyzed countries.

   Figure 3 shows the proportions of retired elderly by age by pooling all samples. In Figure 3,

the pensionable age is represented by the red line. In the US, the UK, Denmark, France, Germany,

Switzerland, Japan (male), and South Korea, there is a sharp increase in the proportion of retired

around the pensionable age. In the US, Denmark, France, Germany, and Switzerland, around the

early retirement age, there is also a sharp increase in the proportion of retired elderly. In the

UK, Japan (male) and South Korea, there is a sharp increase in the proportion of retired elderly

around the normal retirement age. Additionally, after the early retirement age, the slope of the

proportion of the retired elderly changes in many countries. As a result, we use the cross term

(e.g., {ageit ≥ Aeb
                 i } · ageit ) to identify this movement. In the next section, the first stage results are

presented as to check the validity of our strategy. Eibich (2015) uses a similar strategy to exploit the

discontinuity of retirement status around the pensionable age. Furthermore, we control individual

demographics (xit ), including variables to control the age effect. Around the pensionable age, it is

possible that there is a change in individual demographics. As such, we control for these effects.


5.2   The Results

   We discuss the estimated results only when the coefficients of IV in the first stage are significant.

We also test the endogeneity of retirement with the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test. When we do not

reject the null hypothesis, we support the results of FE model. We use the retirement definition



                                                   15


of “not work for pay” in all countries except Korea and Japan. On the other hand, in Korea and

Japan, we use the retirement definition of “complete retire.” This is because, in Korea and Japan,

we do not obtain a significant result in the first stage regression by using the retirement definition

of not work for pay. We perform a robustness check with respect to the retirement definition in the

next section. With respect to Depression, we use both CES-D and Euro-D, and identify which scale

we use in the analysis (e.g., US (CES-D(0-8), Denmark (Euro-D)). The total score of CES-D is

seven or eight. On the other hand, the total score of Euro-D is 20. We use Euro-D in the European

countries because the sample size is larger when we use Euro-D. The first stage results are shown

in Table 11.12)


   • As per Table 12, in each health index, only Korea has an opposite effect compared to the

     US. 13) With respect to self-reported health and CES-D, in half of the surveyed countries, we

     observe a positive effect of retirement on health. However, only in Korea and the US there is

     a significant effect on cognitive function. Nonetheless, there is an opposite effect (positive or

     negative) between these countries.

   • As per Table 13, there is a negative effect or no effect of retirement on BMI (BMI: negative

     = increase and positive = decrease). However, in half of the surveyed countries, there is a

     positive effect of retirement on ADL.

   • Summarizing the estimated results (Table 12 and 13), in the US, we observe a change in health

     outcomes after retirement for almost all health outcomes. BMI increases after retirement in

     the US. With respect to poor health, CES-D and ADL summaries, health outcomes improve

     after retirement, as do in the UK. On the other hand, in Denmark, France, Germany, and

     Japan, almost all health outcomes remain constant after retirement. In Switzerland, no health

     outcome changes after retirement.

   • Summarizing the results by gender (Table 12 and 13), with respect to poor health, CES-D

     and ADL summaries, in the US and UK, the coefficients are similar for both elderly males

     and females. In these countries, health outcomes improve after retirement for both elderly

     males and females. Regarding the CES-D summary, the magnitude of the coefficient is large

                                                 16


      (-2.435) for elderly Japanese males, and their CES-D summary improves after retirement.

      Additionally, BMI increases after retirement, and the magnitude of the coefficient is large

      (2.796) in Japan.

   • In subjective indexes, such as the self-report of health and depression, the index improves

      in many countries, while the health self-report index worsens only in Korea. With respect

      to objective indexes, such as BMI and ADL, BMI increases or remains constant and ADL

      improves or remains constant.


   Subsequently, we check the sensitivity of the retirement definition and the pattern of control

variables on the effect of retirement on health. We prepare two retirement definitions (“not work for

pay” and “complete retire”) and four control patterns (“Pattern 1,” etc.). According to Table 14, in

most analyzed countries and patterns, the estimates are robust, although we change the retirement

definition and control variable patterns for each country regardless of health outcomes. The results

are sensitive depending on the definition of retirement in Denmark (Pattern 4, ADL) and Germany

(Pattern 4, health self-report). The results are not significant for some countries, but there is no

opposite effect. In Table 14, we show only the final results after performing the DWH test, by

choosing FE or FE-IV.


5.3   Discussion

   We summarize our main results in Table 15. Our analysis method (FE-IV) is established in this

section. According to Table 15, when we fix our analysis method, we find a few of opposite results

(positive or negative effects) (health self-report, cognition). For each health index, we obtain positive

(negative) or no effects of retirement on health in all surveyed countries. The important point is that

there is heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health, even if we fix our method and control for

retirement endogeneity. Heterogeneities depending on the surveyed countries cannot be explained

by the differences in the analysis method. It is possible that these differences can be explained

by the heterogeneity of the health investment behavior change after retirement. Consequently, we

should investigate the relationship between the heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health



                                                   17


observed in many countries and the heterogeneity of the change in health investment behaviors after

retirement. Eibich (2015) discusses this point solely for Germany.



6    Conclusion

    We summarize the results of this study as follows.


    • Review 1:

        – The sensitivity of replacing the definition of retirement is not strong.

        – The sensitivity of replacing the analysis method is not weak. In almost all indexes, the

           estimated results change when replacing the analysis method.

        – The sensitivity of replacing the surveyed country is also significant.

    • Review 2:

        – The choice of the estimation method seems to be the key factor for explaining the dif-

           ference in the estimation results in all indexes. Additionally, what the researcher uses

           as control variables is also important. In all health indexes, the estimation method

           plus other factors (e.g., method + controls) changes the estimation result. What the

           researcher uses as control variables is also included in all health indexes.

        – The influence of the difference in the surveyed country is also important for explaining

           the difference in the effect of retirement on health.

        – Changes in the definition of retirement have a lower impact.


    We summarize our main results in Table 15, and fix our analysis method (FE-IV) in Section 5.

According to Table 15, when we fix our analysis method, we obtain comparatively stable results.

However, there is heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health even if we fix our methods

and control for the endogeneity of retirement. As such, future work could answer on why is there

heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health among different countries. It is possible that the

change in health investment behaviors after retirement is an important factor for explaining these


                                                  18


heterogeneities. Future work can investigate the relationship between the heterogeneity of the effect

of retirement on health observed in many countries and the one of the change in health investment

behaviors after retirement.

A.1    Pension Eligibility Age

    To obtain pensionable age, we use the information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in each

country. However, this information is not available for some countries. Subsequently, we contact the

Bureau of Labor Statistics or Bureau of Statistics directly, and obtain the information if possible. If

we cannot find any information in the previous step, we use the OECD Pensions at a Glance, social

security programs throughout the world (Europe, Asia and the Pacific, and the Americas) and The

EUs Mutual Information System in Social Protection (MISSOC) as data sources. However, we

cannot obtain the detailed pension eligibility age for many countries. Finally, the correct pension

eligibility ages are obtained for the USA, the UK, Germany, France, Denmark, Switzerland, Czech,

Estonia, Japan, China, and Korea. We do not consider countries where this information is missing.

In this paper, we analyze the USA, the UK, Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan and

Korea. We show the pension eligibility ages used in this paper, as per the following tables.

A.4    Verification Framework 1 Results

   We show the detailed results in section 4.2.



Self-report of health (Dave et al. (2008) versus Coe and Zamarro (2011)):

   • According to Table A.4.1, when transplanting one factor from Dave et al. (2008) to Coe and

      Zamarro (2011), the replacement of the analysis method and the surveyed country change

      from a negative effect to no effect and vice-versa. The sensitivity of replacing the index, the

      control variables, the analysis method, and the surveyed country are important.

ADL (Dave et al. (2008) versus Neuman (2008)):

   • We discuss Table A.4.2. Transplanting one factor from Dave et al. (2008) to Neuman (2008),

      the replacement of the estimation method and the sample selection method change from a

      negative effect to no effect, while replacing other factors does not produce such a difference,

      and vice-versa. This time, the replacement of each factor, except the definition of retirement,

      produces a change in the results, while the change in the estimation method produces the

      opposite result for female samples.

Depression (Dave et al. (2008) versus Coe and Zamarro (2011)):

   • We discuss Table A.4.3. Transplanting one factor from Dave et al. (2008) to Coe and Zamarro

      (2011), the replacement of the estimation method and the surveyed country, 14) change from a

      negative effect to no effect, while replacing other factors does not produce such a difference, and

      vice-versa. This time, the replacement of each factor, except the control variables, produces

      a change in the results.

BMI (Godard (2016) versus Johnston and Lee (2009)):

   • We discuss Table A.4.4. Transplanting one factor from Godard (2016) to Johnston and Lee

      (2009), the replacement of all factors except the definition of retirement and the control

      variables change from a negative effect to no effect, while replacing other factors does not

      produce such a difference, and vice-versa. This time, the replacement of each factor does not

      produce a change in the results.

A.5    Notes on Replication and Replacement

   • Replication 1: In this subsection, we explain the details of replication and replacement proce-

      dures. Table A.5.1 shows the table number in the original papers we replicate, the number of

      samples when we replicate the results, and our comments on the replication. In most cases,

      we can replicate the results in preceding literature with a number of samples similar to the

      original number of samples.

   • Replication 2: We exclude some control variables when we replicate Neuman (2008) because

      of data limitation. Neuman (2008) uses detailed regional information and the health status

      when a respondent is a child. We have generated these variables by using the Cross-Wave:

      Census Region/Division and Mobility File and Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE) Files.

      However, when we include these generated variables in the estimated model, the sample size

      significantly decreases. Therefore, we exclude these variables from the control variables in the

      Neuman (2008) replication.

   Tables A.5.2 and A.5.3 summarize the notes on the replacement procedures by each replacement

factor. For example, (Bonsang et al. (2012) → Coe and Zamarro (2011)) describe the comments

when we carry out the replacement procedure from Bonsang et al. (2012) to Coe and Zamarro

(2011). (Controls) describes the comments when we replace control variables.

                                           Table A.5.2: Notes on Replacement 1
Cognition
Bonsang et al. (2012) → Coe and Zamarro (2011)
 (Controls)
    •We exclude some control variables Coe and Zamarro (2011) include because the variables are not available in all
    waves used in Bonsang et al. (2012). The problem is that the sample size significantly decreases when we include these
    variables.∗1
 (Sample)
    •Coe and Zamarro (2011) use health condition variables to restrict the analyzed samples in the SHARE. Since some
    of these variables are not available in the HRS, we do not apply the same sample restriction procedure in Coe and
    Zamarro (2011).
Coe and Zamarro (2011) → Bonsang et al. (2012)
  (Method and data )
    •Since Coe and Zamarro (2011) use only wave 1 of the SHARE, we cannot directly apply the FE-IV estimation for the
    analysis framework of Coe and Zamarro (2011). Therefore, we use waves 1 and 2 of the SHARE for FE-IV estimation
    when replacing the method and the dataset. Additionally, since the answer options are different between the waves 1
    and 2 of SHARE, we use the chronic diseases number variable that only counts the diseases asked in both waves for
    replacement, for which we use the wave 2 SHARE.

Self-report of health
Dave et al. (2008) → Coe and Zamarro (2011)
   (Method)
     •Since Dave et al. (2008) use the FE estimation, they do not use the IVs. Therefore, when applying IV estimation to
     Dave et al. (2008), we use the same pensionable ages as Bonsang et al. (2012) for the IVs, because Dave et al. (2008)
     and Bonsang et al. (2012) analyze the USA and the data collection periods roughly overlap.
     •We use age and age squared instead of the age dummy when we use the IV estimation. There is a multicollinearity
     between the IVs (takes the value 1 after a respondent reaches pensionable age) and the age dummy when applying the
     IV estimation.
Coe and Zamarro (2011) → Dave et al. (2008)
   (Index)
     •We use “Poor health” (included in wave 1 and 2) as the index for FE estimation because the European scale of
     self-report of health is asked only in the SHARE wave 1.
   (Method and data)
     •We use wave 1 and 2 in the SHARE for FE estimation when replacing the method and data because of the same
     reason in (method and data) of the cognition section.
   (Controls)
     •We exclude some control variables that are not asked in the SHARE∗2 and the health insurance variable that is asked
     in only several countries, when replacing the control pattern from Coe and Zamarro (2011) to Dave et al. (2008).
   (Data)
     •We use “Poor health” in the HRS because the European scale of self-report of health is not asked in the HRS when
     replacing the dataset from the SHARE to the HRS.

∗1 e.g., non-professional activities and physical activities.
∗2 e.g., race, religious preference.

 (Controls)
    •The same comments as in Self-report of health apply.
  (Data)
    •We use the CES-D in the HRS because the EURO-D is not asked in the HRS when replacing the dataset from the
    SHARE to the HRS.

ADL
Dave et al. (2008) → Neuman (2008)
  (Method)
   •When applying the estimation method by Neuman (2008), we use the same estimation equation and the IVs as Neuman
   (2008).

      Note



 1)
      We omit the literature on the effect of health on retirement. However, a representative paper is McGarry (2004).
 2)
      Lindeboom and Kerkhofs (2009) also specify a model that addresses work decisions, health and health reporting
      simultaneously.
 3)
      Iparraguirre (2014) broadly reviews some methodological differences found in the literature including public health
      literature.
 4)
      Charles (2004) surveyed psychological research both theoretically and empirically.

      Bound and Waidmann (2007), Coe and Lindeboom (2008), Dave et al. (2008), Neuman (2008), Johnston and Lee
      (2009), Lee and Smith (2009), Latif (2011), Coe and Zamarro (2011), Behncke (2012), Hernaes et al. (2013), Fonseca
      et al. (2014) and Insler (2014) are representative papers. Furthermore, recently review papers have been published
      on the impact of retirement on health in other fields. For example, van der Heide et al. (2013) put retirement in the
      public health context, whereas Wang and Shi (2014) took up retirement in a psychological context.

      There are two rounds in the Word Recall tests. In the first round (Immediate Word Recall), there is a test to recall
      the number of words as much as possible. After a while, the second round starts. In the second round (Delayed Word
      Recall), a respondent is asked to recall the same words as much as possible.
 8)
      “Bad health” is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if respondents assess their health as fair, bad, and very bad,
      and 0 otherwise.
 9)
      The Gateway to Global Aging Data (http://gateway.usc.edu) provides harmonized versions of data from the interna-
      tional ageing and retirement studies (e.g., HRS, ELSA, SHARE, KLoSA). All variables of each dataset have the same
      items and follow the same naming conventions. The harmonized datasets enable researchers to conduct cross-national
      comparative studies. The program code to generate the harmonized datasets from the original datasets is provided
      by the Center for Global Ageing Research, USC Davis School of Gerontology and the Center for Economic and Social
      Research (CESR). This code is used to input some variables, such as measures of assets and income.

      Bonsang et al. (2012), Latif (2013), Zhu and He (2015), Zhu (2016), Zhu (2016) and Godard (2016) exploit a similar
      identification strategy.

      For Germany and Denmark (except for females), we use only the dummy variables (e.g. {ageit ≥ Aeb
                                                                                                    i } ).
