The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat is a vital interface between global
policies in the economic, social and environmental spheres and national action. The Department works in three
main interlinked areas: (i) it compiles, generates and analyses a wide range of economic, social and environmental
data and information on which States Members of the United Nations draw to review common problems and take
stock of policy options; (ii) it facilitates the negotiations of Member States in many intergovernmental bodies on
joint courses of action to address ongoing or emerging global challenges; and (iii) it advises interested Governments
on the ways and means of translating policy frameworks developed in United Nations conferences and summits into
programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build national capacities.

The Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs provides the international community
with timely and accessible population data and analysis of population trends and development outcomes for all
countries and areas of the world. To this end, the Division undertakes regular studies of population size and
characteristics and of all three components of population change (fertility, mortality and migration). Founded in
1946, the Population Division provides substantive support on population and development issues to the United
Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Population and Development.
It also leads or participates in various interagency coordination mechanisms of the United Nations system. The
work of the Division also contributes to strengthening the capacity of Member States to monitor population trends
and to address current and emerging population issues.

    In the area of population ageing, the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social
Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat prepares national, regional and global estimates and projections
of older populations, monitors levels and trends in population ageing and collects and analyses
information on the relationship between population ageing and development. The Population Division
also organizes expert group meetings on various aspects of population ageing.

    This report is the fifth in the series World Population Ageing. The first report was released in 2002 in
conjunction with the Second World Assembly on Ageing. The present report, which updates the 2007,
2009 and 2013 editions, provides a description of global trends in population ageing and includes new
features on the socio-economic and health aspects of ageing. This report is accompanied by an interactive
database on the Profiles of Ageing 2015.

    This report was prepared by a team led by Jorge Bravo, including Sara Hertog, Yumiko Kamiya and
Mun Sim Lai, who carried out research and drafted chapters. Ivan Prlincevic contributed programming
and data processing and Donna Culpepper provided formatting and editorial support. Barney Cohen and
John Wilmoth provided key guidance and useful comments on the draft report.

   The present report has been issued without formal editing. Responsibility for the World Population
Ageing 2015 report rests with the Population Division.

                      Sources, methods and classifications

    Data on demographic trends used in the present report are taken from the 2015 Revision of the official
United Nations world population estimates and projections (United Nations, Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2015). In addition, data on the levels of older persons’ consumption
and the sources of financing for that consumption are from the National Transfer Accounts database
(2015). Data on labour force participation were obtained from the International Labour Organization
(2015) and data on statutory retirement age from the United States Social Security Administration (2013
and 2014). Data on healthy life expectancy, causes of morbidity and mortality, and burden of disability
were obtained from the World Health Organization (2014).

     The population estimates and projections, which are prepared biennially by the Population Division
of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, provide the standard
and consistent set of population figures that are used throughout the United Nations system as the basis
for activities requiring population information. In the 2015 Revision of the World Population Prospects,
standard demographic techniques were used to estimate the population by age and sex, as well as trends in
total fertility, life expectancy at birth, infant mortality and international migration for the years 1950
through 2015, from data available from censuses and post-enumeration surveys; demographic and health
surveys; population and vital registration systems; scientific reports and data collections; and from data
and estimates provided by international agencies. The resulting estimates provided the basis from which
the population projections follow. In the 2015 Revision, the population projections are based on a
probabilistic (Bayesian) method for projecting total fertility and life expectancy at birth. This method is
based on empirical fertility and mortality trends estimated for all countries of the world for the period
1950 to 2015. The present report draws on the medium variant population projections through the year
2050.1

    The countries and areas identified as statistical units by the Statistics Division of the United Nations
and covered by the above estimates and projections, are grouped geographically into six regions: Africa;
Asia; Europe; Latin America and the Caribbean; Northern America; and Oceania. The countries are also
summarized, for statistical convenience, into two general groups―more developed and less
developed―on the basis of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The less developed regions
include all regions of Africa, Asia (excluding Japan), Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania
(excluding Australia and New Zealand). The more developed regions include all other regions plus the
three countries excluded from the less developed regions. The group of least developed countries, as
defined by the United Nations General Assembly in its resolutions (59/209, 59/210 and 60/33) in 2015
comprises 48 countries. In addition, the countries are summarized within four groups defined by the
World Bank according to the gross national income (GNI) per capita in 2014: high-income countries are
those with GNI per capita of $12,736 or more; upper-middle income countries are those with GNI per
capita of more than $4,125 but less than $12,736; lower-middle income countries are those with GNI per
capita of more than US$1,045 but less than $4,125; and low-income countries are those with GNI per
capita of $1,045 or less. See Annex II for further detail on composition of the above mentioned groupings.

                           I. Introduction and key findings

    The world’s population is ageing: virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth
in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. Population ageing—the
increasing share of older persons in the population—is poised to become one of the most
significant social transformations of the twenty-first century, with implications for nearly all
sectors of society, including labour and financial markets, the demand for goods and services,
such as housing, transportation and social protection, as well as family structures and inter-
generational ties. Preparing for the economic and social shifts associated with an ageing
population is thus essential to ensure progress in development, including towards the
achievement of the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Population
ageing is particularly relevant for the goals on poverty eradication, ensuring healthy lives and
well-being at all ages, promoting gender equality and full and productive employment and decent
work for all, reducing inequalities between and within countries, and making cities and human
settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The 2002 Madrid International Plan of
Action on Ageing (MIPAA), adopted during the Second World Assembly on Ageing,
highlighted the need to consider older persons in development planning, emphasizing that older
persons should be able to participate in and benefit equitably from the fruits of development to
advance their health and well-being, and that societies should provide enabling environments for
them to do so. As populations become increasingly aged, it is more important than ever that
governments design innovative policies and public services specifically targeted to older persons,
including those addressing, inter alia, housing, employment, health care, infrastructure and
social protection.

    This report details the important changes that are taking place in the age structures of
populations around the world. Chapter II describes recent and projected future levels and trends
in the numbers and share of older persons in the population. It also presents trends in the
demographic characteristics of the older population with respect to age, sex and urban/rural
residence. Chapter III explores the demographic determinants—trends in fertility, mortality and
migration—of changes to the size and age structure of the population. By adopting a historical
perspective, this chapter identifies the major demographic shocks, as well as the more gradual
demographic shifts, that shape current trends in population ageing. Chapter IV discusses the
challenges posed by the growth in the number and share of older persons in the population for
efforts to eradicate poverty and grow economies, to ensure the sustainability of pension systems,
and to promote health and well-being at all ages. The issues highlighted in this chapter
underscore just how critical the concerns of older persons are for progress in implementing the
2030 Agenda. The key findings of each of these chapters are summarized below:


                              A. LEVELS AND TRENDS IN POPULATION AGEING

    According to data from World Population Prospects: the 2015 Revision (United Nations,
2015), the number of older persons—those aged 60 years or over—has increased substantially in
recent years in most countries and regions, and that growth is projected to accelerate in the
coming decades.


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                  1


       Between 2015 and 2030, the number of people in the world aged 60 years or over
        is projected to grow by 56 per cent, from 901 million to 1.4 billion, and by 2050,
        the global population of older persons is projected to more than double its size in
        2015, reaching nearly 2.1 billion.

       Globally, the number of people aged 80 years or over, the “oldest-old” persons, is
        growing even faster than the number of older persons overall. Projections indicate
        that in 2050 the oldest-old will number 434 million, having more than tripled in
        number since 2015, when there were 125 million people over age 80.

       Over the next 15 years, the number of older persons is expected to grow fastest in
        Latin America and the Caribbean with a projected 71 per cent increase in the
        population aged 60 years or over, followed by Asia (66 per cent), Africa (64 per
        cent), Oceania (47 per cent), Northern America (41 per cent) and Europe (23 per
        cent).

       Globally, during 2010-2015, women outlived men by an average of 4.5 years. As
        a result, women accounted for 54 per cent of the global population aged 60 years
        or over and 61 per cent of those aged 80 years or over in 2015. In the coming
        years, average survival of males is projected to improve and begin to catch up to
        that of females so that the sex balance among the oldest-old persons becomes
        more even. The proportion of women at age 80 years or over is projected to
        decline to 58 per cent in 2050.

       Both improved longevity and the ageing of larger cohorts, including those born
        during the post-World War II baby boom, mean that the older population is itself
        ageing. The proportion of the world’s older persons who are aged 80 years or over
        is projected to rise from 14 per cent in 2015 to more than 20 per cent in 2050.

       The older population is growing faster in urban areas than in rural areas. At the
        global level between 2000 and 2015, the number of people aged 60 years or over
        increased by 68 per cent in urban areas, compared to a 25 per cent increase in
        rural areas. As a result, older persons are increasingly concentrated in urban areas.
        In 2015, 58 per cent of the world’s people aged 60 years or over resided in urban
        areas, up from 51 per cent in 2000. The oldest-old are even more likely to reside
        in urban areas: the proportion of people aged 80 years or over residing in urban
        areas increased from 56 per cent in 2000 to 63 per cent in 2015.

    Globally, the number of older persons is growing faster than the numbers of people in any
other age group. As a result, the share of older persons in the total population is increasing
virtually everywhere. While population ageing is a global phenomenon, the ageing process is
more advanced in some regions than in others, having begun more than a century ago in
countries that developed earlier, and getting underway only recently in many countries where the
development process has occurred later, including the decline of fertility.

             In 2015, one in eight people worldwide was aged 60 years or over. By 2030, older
              persons are projected to account for one in six people globally. By the middle of
              the twenty-first century, one in every five people will be aged 60 years or over.

             By 2030, older persons will outnumber children aged 0-9 years (1.4 billion versus
              1.3 billion); by 2050, there will be more people aged 60 years or over than
              adolescents and youth aged 10-24 years (2.1 billion versus 2.0 billion).

             The ageing process is most advanced in high-income countries. Japan is home to
              the world’s most aged population1: 33 per cent were aged 60 years or over in
              2015. Japan is followed by Germany (28 per cent aged 60 years or over), Italy (28
              per cent) and Finland (27 per cent).

             The pace of world population ageing is accelerating. Projections indicate that the
              proportion aged 60 years or over globally will increase more than 4 percentage
              points over the next 15 years, from 12.3 per cent in 2015 to 16.5 per cent in 2030,
              compared to the 2.3 percentage point increase in the share of older persons that
              occurred between 2000 and 2015.

             By 2030, older persons are expected to account for more than 25 per cent of the
              populations in Europe and in Northern America, 20 per cent in Oceania, 17 per
              cent in Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 6 per cent in Africa.

             In 2050, 44 per cent of the world’s population will live in relatively aged
              countries, with at least 20 per cent of the population aged 60 years or over, and
              one in four people will live in a country where more than 30 per cent of people
              are above age 60.

             The pace of population ageing in many developing countries today is substantially
              faster than occurred in developed countries in the past. Consequently, today’s
              developing countries must adapt much more quickly to ageing populations and
              often at much lower levels of national income compared to the experience of
              countries that developed much earlier.


                                    B. DEMOGRAPHIC DRIVERS OF POPULATION AGEING

    Population ageing is in many ways a demographic success story, driven by changes in
fertility and mortality that are associated with economic and social development. Progress in
reducing child mortality, improving access to education and employment opportunities,
advancing gender equality, and promoting reproductive health and access to family planning
have all contributed to reductions in birth rates. Moreover, advancements in public health and
medical technologies, along with improvements in living conditions, mean that people are living
longer and, in many cases, healthier lives than ever before, particularly at advanced ages.

Together, these declines in fertility and increases in longevity are producing substantial shifts in
the population age structure, such that the share of children is shrinking while that of older
persons continues to grow.

       The growth rate of the population of older persons today is a function of the levels
        of fertility prevailing some 60 years ago when today’s new cohorts of older
        persons were born, together with changes in the likelihood that members of those
        birth cohorts survived to older ages. Because fertility rates in the mid-twentieth
        century were higher in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America and the
        Caribbean—above five children per woman, on average—the growth rates of the
        older populations in those regions today are significantly faster than in Europe,
        where fertility in 1950-1955 had already fallen below three children per woman in
        many countries.

       Trends in the growth rate of the population of older persons reveal the powerful
        influence of major historical events in shaping the age composition of the
        population. The cohorts that entered their 80’s during the late-1990’s are those
        who were born during World War I, a time of depressed fertility in many
        countries that resulted in smaller birth cohorts. As a result, growth of the global
        population aged 80 years or over during 1995-2000 was slow relative to previous
        decades and has accelerated more recently as the cohorts born during the post-war
        fertility rebound reached their 80s.

       The fertility impact of World War II is evident in population ageing patterns as
        well. The growth rate of the global population aged 60 years or over has peaked in
        2010-2015 and the rate of growth of the population aged 80 years or over is
        projected to peak in 2030-2035, marking the periods during which those born
        during the post-war baby boom reach older ages.

       Past and current regional levels of fertility predict the present and future rates of
        growth of their older populations. In Asia, the growth rate of the population of
        older persons is projected to decline precipitously after 2025, reflecting the rapid
        decline in fertility that began in the mid-1960s in that region. In Africa, the pace
        of growth of the population aged 60 years or over is projected to accelerate from
        just over 3 per cent per year in 2010-2015, reaching nearly 3.9 per cent per year in
        2040-2045, reflecting the relatively high fertility rates of the region during the
        second half of the twentieth century. The pace of growth of the older population
        of Africa projected for the 2040s is faster than any region has experienced since
        1950, when the data series begins.

       The immediate cause of population ageing is fertility decline. However, improved
        longevity contributes as well, first by eliminating the demographic necessity of
        high fertility and second by increasing the number of survivors to older ages. By
        2050, life expectancy at birth is projected to surpass 80 years in Europe, Latin
        America and the Caribbean, Northern America and Oceania; and it will approach
        80 years in Asia and 70 years in Africa.


4                                                                         World Population Ageing 2015


        Improvements in survival at age 60 years or over have accounted for half of the
         total improvement in life expectancy in Europe, Northern America and Oceania
         over the past two decades. Reduced mortality at younger ages was more
         influential in improving the life expectancy at birth in Africa, Asia and Latin
         America and the Caribbean.

        In 2010-2015, 60-year-old persons globally could expect to live an additional 20.2
         years, on average. Across the six regions, life expectancy at age 60 years was
         highest in Oceania and Northern America, at 23.7 years and 23.5 years,
         respectively, and lowest in Africa, at 16.7 years.

        Among today’s young people, survival to age 80 is expected to be the norm
         everywhere but in Africa. Worldwide, 60 per cent of women and 52 per cent of
         men born in 2000-2005 are expected to survive to their eightieth birthdays,
         compared to less than 40 per cent of the women and men born in 1950-1955.

        While declining fertility and increasing longevity are the key drivers of
         population ageing globally, international migration has also contributed to
         changing population age structures in some countries and regions. However, in
         most countries, international migration is projected to have only small effects on
         the pace of population ageing. Between 2015 and 2030, net migration is projected
         to slow population ageing by at least 1 percentage point in 24 countries or areas,
         and to accelerate population ageing by at least 1 percentage point in 14 countries
         or areas.


                          C. POPULATION AGEING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

    Growth in the numbers and proportions of older persons can be expected to have far reaching
economic, social and political implications. In many countries the number of older persons is
growing faster than the number of people in the traditional working ages, leading many
governments to consider increasing the statutory ages at retirement in an effort to prolong the
labour force participation of older persons and improve the financial sustainability of pension
systems. At the same time, population ageing and growth in the number of persons at very
advanced ages, in particular, puts pressure on health systems, increasing the demand for care,
services and technologies to prevent and treat non-communicable diseases and chronic
conditions associated with old age. Countries can address these and other challenges by
anticipating the coming demographic shifts and enacting policies proactively to adapt to an
ageing population.

Ageing, poverty and economic growth

        In general, poverty rates among older persons tend to mirror fairly closely those
         of the population overall, although disparities are evident in some countries and
         regions. In many countries where pension systems are not in place or fail to


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                5


        provide adequate income, including several in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia,
        older persons are more likely to live in poverty than people at younger ages.
        Conversely, in countries with adequate pension systems with broad coverage,
        including several in Latin America and in Europe, poverty rates among older
        persons are essentially the same as or lower than those of the general population.

       Age patterns of consumption behaviour provide an additional indication of the
        level of welfare among older persons. In low-income and middle-income
        countries, levels of consumption tend to decline at older ages, indicating that older
        persons are faring less well than adults in other age groups in these countries. In
        contrast, in many high-income countries, the average levels of consumption
        among older persons are higher than among adults in other age groups—by as
        much as one third or more in some countries—indicating that older persons are
        comparatively well off in these countries.

       Public transfers, particularly for health care, play an important redistributive role
        to bolster the levels of consumption among older persons in many high-income
        countries. Conversely, in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, older
        persons finance most of their health care consumption through out-of-pocket
        expenditures. The low levels of public health expenditure in these countries
        contribute to a lack of health security and inferior care for older persons.

       Older persons’ welfare is related to the share of consumption financed by public
        transfers. In many low-income countries where older persons are less well off
        than adults in other age groups, public transfers finance less than 15 per cent of
        total old-age consumption, compared to the 30 per cent or more of older persons’
        consumption that is financed by public transfers in many high-income countries,
        where older persons tend to be better off than adults in other age groups.

       Population ageing need not impede continued economic growth. Countries with
        increasing economic support ratios—thus, a rise in the ratio of producers to
        consumers in the population—benefit from a “first demographic dividend”. In
        societies where investments in human capital and savings accompany low fertility
        and increasing longevity motivates people to accumulate assets for old age, the
        increased volume of savings can further enhance economic growth, leading to a
        “second demographic dividend.” The second dividend is likely to be more
        significant in societies that do not rely solely on public or familial transfers to
        finance older persons’ consumption, but also promote retirement savings.

Ensuring social protection for older persons and the sustainability of pension systems

       Current demographic trends mean that each successive cohort of older persons
        can expect to live longer and possibly also have fewer adult children as potential
        sources of support in old age. In 2015, there were 7 people in the traditional
        working ages, 20-64 years, for each older person aged 65 years or over in the
        world. By 2050, there will be 3.5 working-aged people for each older person in


6                                                                              World Population Ageing 2015


         the world, and all major regions except Africa are expected to have potential
         support ratios of 3.2 or lower.

        Among people aged 65 years or over globally in 2015, 30 per cent of men and 15
         per cent of women were active in the labour force. Older men and women in
         developing regions were more likely to be active in the labour force than their
         peers in the developed regions, due in part to differences in the structure and
         availability of pension systems across regions.

        In Europe, Oceania and Northern America, the labour force participation of older
         men has increased gradually since 1990, and it is projected to continue to increase
         in the future. In contrast, in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa,
         the labour force participation of older men has declined steadily. Among older
         women, labour force participation has increased since 1990 in all regions.

        In response to recent trends in population ageing, many low-income and middle-
         income countries have expanded the coverage of their contributory pension
         schemes and established non-contributory social pensions. Many high-income
         countries have undertaken fiscal consolidation reforms to their pension systems
         by raising the statutory pensionable age, reducing benefits or increasing
         contribution rates.

        At the global level, nearly half of all people who have reached statutory
         pensionable ages do not receive a pension, and for many of those who do receive
         a pension, the levels of support may be inadequate. Pension coverage is typically
         lower among women than among men owing to their lower rates of attachment to
         the labour market, their over-representation in the informal sector, or their work
         as self-employed or unpaid family workers. In many countries, the survivor’s
         benefits paid through a husband’s contributory pension benefits are the sole
         sources of income for older women.

Promoting health and well-being at older ages

        Changes are needed around the globe to continue to adapt health systems to
         serve a growing number and proportion of older persons and to maximize health
         and well-being at all ages. The World Health Organization emphasizes that these
         changes need not imply exorbitant increases in national health budgets, even in
         countries with rapidly ageing populations. Indeed, technology-related changes in
         health care, growth in personal incomes and cultural norms and attitudes
         surrounding end-of-life care are far more influential than shifts in population age
         structure in driving increases in health care expenditures.

        Older persons are tremendously diverse with respect to their health and well-
         being. Understanding levels and trends in the prevalence and severity of
         disability is key to assessing the implications of ageing for population health. For
         the world as a whole in 2013, people lost an average of approximately nine years


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                  7


        of healthy life due to disability. In general, the number of healthy life years lost
        due to disability tends to be greater in countries with a higher life expectancy at
        birth. However, people living in countries with longer average lifespans tend to
        spend a smaller proportion of their lives with disability compared to countries
        where life expectancy is shorter. In Europe, the average nine years of healthy life
        lost due to disability in 2013 accounted for just under 12 per cent of the average
        76-year lifespan, whereas in Africa the average eight years of healthy life lost
        due to disability accounted for nearly 14 per cent of the average 58-year lifespan.

       Whether the growing numbers of older persons are living their later years in
        good health is a crucial consideration for policy development. If the added years
        of life expectancy are spent with disability, then demographic trends could
        portend substantially increased demand for health care. If the onset or severity of
        ill health is instead postponed as life expectancy increases, then the pressures
        exerted on the health system by a growing population of older persons may be
        attenuated. So far, evidence of trends in the health status of older persons is
        mostly limited to high-income countries and points to different conclusions
        depending on the study or context, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions
        about the fundamental questions.

       Given the projected growth of the older population, which will occur in virtually
        every country of the world over the coming decades, health systems should
        prepare now to address the specific health concerns of older persons. Unipolar
        depressive disorders are the leading cause of disability among women aged 60
        years or over, followed by hearing loss, back and neck pain, Alzheimer’s disease
        and other dementias, and osteoarthritis. Among older men, hearing loss is the
        leading cause of disability, followed by back and neck pain, falls, chronic
        obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus.

    As populations continue to grow older during the post-2015 era, it is imperative that
governments design innovative policies specifically targeted to the needs of older persons,
including those addressing housing, employment, health care, social protection and other forms
of intergenerational support. Because the coming demographic shifts are foreseeable with much
clarity over the next few decades, governments are afforded the opportunity to adopt a proactive
approach to align their policies to the evolving needs of an ageing population.

              II. Levels and trends in population ageing
                              A. TRENDS IN THE NUMBERS OF OLDER PERSONS

The number of older persons in the world has increased substantially in recent years and
that growth is projected to accelerate in the coming decades.

     Worldwide, there were 901 million people aged 60 years or over in 2015, an increase of 48
per cent over the 607 million older persons globally in 2000 (table II.1; figure II.1). By 2030, the
number of people in the world aged 60 years or over is projected to grow by 56 per cent, to 1.4
billion, and by 2050, the global population of older persons is projected to more than double its
size in 2015, reaching nearly 2.1 billion.

    Globally, the number of people aged 80 years or over, the “oldest-old” persons, is growing
even faster than the number of older persons overall. In 2000, there were 71 million people aged
80 or over worldwide. Since then, the number of oldest-old grew by 77 per cent to 125 million
in 2015, and it is projected to increase by 61 per cent over the next 15 years, reaching nearly 202
million in 2030. Projections indicate that in 2050 the oldest-old will number 434 million
globally, having more than tripled in number since 2015.

Two thirds of the world’s older persons live in the developing regions and their numbers
are growing faster there than in the developed regions.

     The more developed regions were home to 38 per cent of the world’s older persons in 2000,
but that percentage fell to 33 per cent in 2015 and is projected to continue to fall, such that, in
2030, 27 per cent of the world’s population aged 60 years or over will reside in the more
developed regions. The growth rate of the older population of the more developed regions is
projected to slow in the coming decades. While the number of people aged 60 years or over in
developed regions grew by 29 per cent between 2000 and 2015, from 231 million to 299 million,
it is projected to grow by 26 per cent over the next 15 years, reaching 375 million in 2030.

    In contrast, in the developing regions, the growth of the population aged 60 years or over is
accelerating. The number of older persons in the less developed regions grew from 376 million
in 2000 to 602 million in 2015—an increase of 60 per cent—and it is projected to grow by 71 per
cent between 2015 and 2030, when a projected 1 billion people aged 60 years or over will reside
in the less developed regions. Projections indicate that 1.7 billion people aged 60 years or over—
nearly 80 per cent of the world’s older population—will live in the less developed regions in
2050.

    In the recent past, the older population of the least developed countries was growing more
slowly than in the other less developed countries. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of
persons aged 60 years or over in the least developed countries increased by 54 per cent,
compared to 61 per cent in the other less developed countries. However, growth in the number of
older persons is accelerating more quickly in the least developed countries, such that, between
2015 and 2030, the projected 70 per cent increase in the population aged 60 years or over is

In 2050, two out of every three oldest-old persons will live in developing regions.

    The cohorts born during World War II will enter their 80s during 2015-2030. Because
fertility was depressed during the war, resulting in smaller birth cohorts, the population aged 80
years or over is projected to grow more slowly over the coming 15 years than over the previous
15 years.2 In the more developed regions, the number of oldest-old persons grew by 62 per cent
over the previous 15-year period, from 37 million in 2000 to 59 million in 2015, but it is
projected to grow by 44 per cent over the next 15 years, reaching 85 million in 2030. The
number of oldest-old persons residing in the less developed regions in 2000, 34 million, was very
similar to the number in the more developed regions. However, the population aged 80 years or
over is growing faster in the less developed regions than in the more developed regions: it
increased by more than 92 per cent between 2000 and 2015 and is projected to grow further by
76 per cent between 2015 and 2030. Consequently, the world’s oldest-old persons are
increasingly concentrated in the developing regions, from 49 per cent in 2000 to 53 per cent in
2015, and that proportion is projected to rise further to 58 per cent in 2030 and to 71 per cent in
2050.

   The number of oldest-old persons in the least developed countries nearly doubled between
2000 and 2015, from 2.4 million to 4.8 million persons aged 80 years or over, and their number

is projected to continue to grow, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the past, reaching 8.4
million in 2030. In 2015, the least developed countries were home to 3.8 per cent of the global
population aged 80 years or over, and by 2050 their share of the world’s oldest-old persons is
projected to rise to 4.8 per cent.

Over the next 15 years, the number of older persons is expected to grow fastest in Latin
America and the Caribbean with a projected 71 per cent increase in the population aged 60
years or over, followed by Asia (66 per cent) and Africa (64 per cent).

    With 508 million people aged 60 years or over in 2015, Asia was home to 56 per cent of the
global older population, and, in 2030, Asia’s share of the world’s older persons is projected to
increase to 60 per cent when a projected 845 million people aged 60 years or over will reside in
the region (table II.1; figure II.2). According to projections, by 2030, Asia will be home to more
than half of the world’s oldest-old persons as well, up from 48 per cent in 2015. Moreover,
projections indicate that in 2050, nearly 62 per cent of people aged 60 years or over and 59 per
cent of people aged 80 years or over will reside in Asia.

    Latin America and the Caribbean’s 71 million older persons in 2015 accounted for 7.9 per
cent of the global total. The share of the world’s older persons residing in this region is expected
to grow to 8.6 per cent in 2030, when a projected 121 million people aged 60 years or over will
live there. Africa was home to a relatively small number of people aged 60 years or over, with 64
million in 2015, representing 7.2 per cent of the global total. In 2030, Africa’s projected 105
million older persons could account for 7.5 per cent of the older population worldwide.

    Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to see the fastest growth in the number of
oldest-old persons as well, with an increase of 81 per cent between 2015 and 2030, which is a
legacy of high fertility rates some 80 years prior, as well as increased longevity. The region is
followed by Oceania, with a 77 per cent projected increase in the number of oldest-old over the
same period, Asia (73 per cent) and Africa (64 per cent).

Europe and Northern America are projected to see substantial increases in the numbers of
older persons, but growth will be slower there than in the other regions.

    The share of the world’s older persons residing in Europe and Northern America is expected
to decline. In 2000, Europe’s 147 million people aged 60 years or over accounted for close to
one in four older persons globally and while their numbers grew to 177 million in 2015, their
share of the world’s older population fell to just under 20 per cent. Europe’s older persons are
projected to grow in number to 217 million in 2030, representing a 23 per cent increase over
2015, but given that this growth is slower than in the other regions, the share of the world’s older
persons residing in Europe in 2030 is projected to fall below 16 per cent. By 2050, the projected
242 million older persons in Europe would account for just 12 per cent of the global population
aged 60 years or over.

    In a trend similar to Europe’s, the number of people aged 60 years or over in Northern
America has grown from 51 million in 2000 to 75 million in 2015 and is projected to rise further
to 105 million in 2030 and 123 million in 2050, while the share of the world’s older persons

residing in Northern America is projected to decline from 8.3 per cent in 2015 to 7.5 per cent in
2030 and to 5.9 per cent in 2050.

    From 2000 to 2015, the number of oldest-old persons in Europe grew much faster than the
overall number of older persons (63 per cent versus 20 per cent), but the rate of increase of the
population aged 80 years or over is projected to slow in the coming years, growing by 33 per
cent between 2015 and 2030, compared to 23 per cent for the overall population aged 60 years or
over. Again, these trends are highly influenced by excess mortality and reduced fertility during
World War II, when the coming cohorts of oldest-old persons were born. In contrast, the growth
in the number of people aged 80 years or over in Northern America is projected to accelerate: the
population of oldest-old persons grew by 36 per cent between 2000 and 2015, from 10 million to
13.6 million and it is projected to rise by 62 per cent between 2015 and 2030, when a projected
22 million people aged 80 years or over will reside in Northern America.

Growth in the number of older persons was fastest in upper-middle-income countries
between 2000 and 2015, and this group of countries is expected to see the fastest growth in
the older population between 2015 and 2030 as well.

    The 320 million people aged 60 years or over in upper-middle-income countries in 2015
represented a 64 per cent increase over 2000 when older persons in those countries numbered

195 million (table II.1; figure II.3). Between 2015 and 2030, upper-middle-income countries are
anticipated to continue to experience rapid growth in the number of older persons: the projected
545 million people aged 60 years or over in 2030 marks a 70 per cent increase over the number
in 2015.

    The older populations of lower-middle-income countries and low-income countries grew at a
slower average pace between 2000 and 2015, increasing by 49 per cent and 56 per cent,
respectively. The growth rates are projected to accelerate in both groups of countries in the
coming years. Between 2015 and 2030, the older population in lower-middle-income countries is
projected to increase by 66 per cent, from 238 million to 394 million, while that in low-income
countries is projected to grow by 63 per cent, from 33 million to 54 million.

    Owing to longer average survival in the high-income countries relative to the other income
groups, a plurality of the world’s oldest-old persons are concentrated in this group of countries.
In 2015, close to 49 per cent of the global population aged 80 years or over lived in high-income
countries, and, while the proportion is projected to decline somewhat, by 2030 high-income
countries are expected to continue to account for 45 per cent of the oldest-old persons in the
world. Of the four income groups, the number of oldest-old persons is projected to grow most
rapidly in low-income countries, where the coming cohorts of oldest-old persons were born
within contexts of very high fertility around the middle of the twentieth century. The low-income
countries as a group are expected to see an 81 per cent increase in the number of oldest-old
persons between 2015 and 2030, followed by upper-middle-income countries, with a 79 per cent
increase in the population aged 80 years or over projected for the same period.

Virtually every country in the world will experience a substantial increase in the size of the
population aged 60 years or over between 2015 and 2030.

    Within each of the development groups, regions and income groups there is a great deal of
heterogeneity in the growth rates of the older population. Figure II.4 shows the projected
percentage change in the number of older persons between 2015 and 2030 plotted according to
the level of gross national income (GNI) per capita in 2014 for the 190 countries with at least
90,000 inhabitants in 2015 and for which GNI information was available, with regions
distinguished by colour. The chart illustrates that while growth in the population aged 60 years or
over is expected across all major income groups and regions of the world, the projected growth
rates vary considerably from country to country.

   Among the 29 low-income countries depicted in figure II.4, most of which are located in sub-
Saharan Africa, the projected growth in the population aged 60 years or over between 2015 and
2030 ranges from 41 per cent in the Central African Republic to 88 per cent in Rwanda. In just
over half of the low-income countries, growth in the number of older persons is projected to
exceed 60 per cent between 2015 and 2030.

    Middle-income countries are anticipating similarly rapid growth in the numbers of older
persons between 2015 and 2030. Of the 100 middle-income countries depicted in figure II.4, 67
per cent are projected to see greater than 60 per cent growth in the number of older persons
during that period and one in four middle-income countries are projected to experience increases
of more than 80 per cent. In India, for example, the number of older persons is projected to grow
by 64 per cent between 2015 and 2030, while in China it is projected to grow by 71 per cent over
the same period. In Tajikistan, Mongolia, the Maldives and Libya, the number of older persons is
projected to more than double by 2030. In each of these four countries, total fertility exceeded
six children per woman during the 1960s and 1970s, when the coming cohorts of older persons
were born.3 Projected growth of the population aged 60 years or over also exceeds 90 per cent in
nine other middle-income countries or areas: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belize, Guyana, Iran,
Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, the State of Palestine and Viet Nam.

    Projected growth rates tend to be slower, on average, for the older populations of high-
income countries. Among the 61 high-income countries depicted in figure II.4, less than one
third are projected to see greater than 60 per cent growth in the number of older persons between
2015 and 2030, while the projected growth is between 20 and 60 per cent in another one third of
countries. Within the high-income group, projected growth in the older population tends to be
higher in countries of Asia. Examples include Singapore, which is expected to see a 97 per cent
increase in the population aged 60 years or over between 2015 and 2030, and the Republic of
Korea with a projected 77 per cent increase over the same period. Projected growth tends to be
lower, on average, in high-income countries of Europe and in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Examples include Finland, with a 20 per cent projected increase in the population aged 60 years
or over between 2015 and 2030, and Uruguay, with a 21 per cent projected increase.

    Of the 201 countries or areas with 90,000 inhabitants or more in 2015, only 9 are expected to
see a less than 10 per cent increase in the population aged 60 years or over between 2015 and
2030. This includes several Eastern European and Baltic States—Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia and Ukraine—where multiple demographic factors result in little or no
growth in the number of older persons, such as low levels of fertility at the time the coming
cohorts of older persons were born, relatively high mortality among adults, and high rates of
emigration in some countries. Outside of Eastern Europe, Japan is projected to see growth in the
number of older persons of only 7 per cent between 2015 and 2030, owing to very low fertility
rates over a number of decades. Lesotho, a country highly affected by excess mortality caused by
HIV and AIDS, is projected to experience a small decline in the number of older persons of just
over 1 per cent between 2015 and 2030.

In 2015, just twenty countries accounted for three quarters of the world’s older population.

    Nearly one in four persons aged 60 years or over in the world in 2015 lived in China (figure
II.5, left chart). Taken together, just five countries—China, India, the United States, Japan and
the Russian Federation—accounted for half of the world’s population aged 60 years or over in
2015. The world’s population aged 80 years or over was similarly concentrated in a small
number of countries. The five countries with the largest number of oldest-old persons—China,
the United States, India, Japan and Germany—collectively accounted for 48 per cent of the

                          B. DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OLDER POPULATION

Women tend to live longer than men, on average, and thus comprise a majority of older
persons, especially at advanced ages.

    Globally, women outlived men by an average of 4.5 years during the period 2010-2015.4 In
2015, women accounted for 54 per cent of the global population aged 60 years or over and 61
per cent of those aged 80 years or over (figure II.6).

The sex balance of the older population is projected to remain relatively unchanged at the
global level in the coming decades.

    Projections indicate that in 2050, women will comprise 53 per cent of the world’s population
aged 60 years or over. Since average survival of males is projected to gradually move closer to
that of females, the sex balance among the oldest-old will become more even. The proportion of
women aged 80 years or over is projected to decline to 58 per cent in 2050.

    The sex ratio—traditionally expressed as the number of men per 100 women—is a useful
measure for describing the sex balance of the older population and trends therein. At the global
level, there were 86 men for every 100 women aged 60 years or over in 2015 and 63 men for
every 100 women aged 80 years or over. Those ratios are projected to rise to 89 and 73,
respectively, in 2050 (figure II.7).

The sex ratio of the older population is lowest in Europe and highest in Asia.

    In 2015, across the world’s regions, the sex balance of the older population was most uneven
(as indicated by low sex ratios) in Europe, where there were just 73 men per 100 women aged 60
years or over and 51 men per 100 women aged 80 years or over. The sex balance was most even
in Asia, where there were 91 men per 100 women aged 60 years or over and 70 men per 100
women aged 80 years or over.

    Between 2015 and 2050, the sex balance of the population aged 60 years or over is projected
to become more even in Europe, Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and
Africa, as the female advantage in life expectancy at age 60 is expected to narrow somewhat in
these regions. At ages 80 or over, the sex balance of the population is projected to become more
even between 2015 and 2050 in all regions except Africa. In general, increasing sex ratios among
oldest-old persons reflect that improvements in the life expectancy at age 80 are occurring at a
faster pace among males than among females.

The older population is itself ageing.

    As a result of both improved longevity and the ageing of large cohorts (that is, the “baby
boomers” born during the post-World War II period), the world’s older population is projected to
become increasingly aged. Globally, the share of the older population that is aged 80 years or
over rose from 9 per cent in 1980 to 14 per cent in 2015 (figure II.8), and it is projected to
remain fairly stable between 2015 and 2030. Between 2030 and 2050 the proportion of the
world’s older persons that are aged 80 years or over is projected to rise from 14 per cent to more
than 20 per cent.

By 2040, the oldest-old are projected to account for one in four older persons in Europe,
Northern America and Oceania.

    In 2015, Europe had the most aged population of older persons, with people aged 80 years or
over accounting for nearly one in five of those aged 60 years or over in the region. The older
populations of Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Africa were much younger by
comparison in 2015: people aged 80 years or over accounted for just 15 per cent, 12 per cent and
9 per cent, respectively, of the older populations in those three regions. According to projections,
the proportion of the older population aged 80 years or over will surpass 25 per cent by 2040 in
Europe, Northern America and Oceania. By 2050, the oldest-old are projected to account for 30
per cent of older persons in Northern America, 29 per cent of older persons in Europe and 27 per
cent of older persons in Oceania. The older populations of Latin America and the Caribbean and
Asia are projected to age considerably between 2030 and 2050, as well. In 2050, the oldest-old
are projected to account for 22 per cent of older persons in Latin America and the Caribbean and
20 per cent of older persons in Asia. The older population of Africa is projected to age more
slowly such that in 2050, people aged 80 years or over will account for 10 per cent of the overall
population of older persons in the region.

The older population is growing faster in urban areas than in rural areas.5

    At the global level, between 2000 and 2015, the number of people aged 60 years or over
increased by 68 per cent in urban areas, compared to a 25 per cent increase in rural areas (figure
II.9). Growth in the number of older persons in urban areas outpaced that in rural areas in all
regions except Oceania, where the rapidly growing cohorts of older persons in the comparatively
rural populations of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia exceed the pace of growth of the urban
older populations in the more urbanized countries of Australia and New Zealand. In Asia, the
number of people aged 60 years or over in urban areas in 2015 was more than double the number
in 2000 (a 106 per cent increase), while in Asia’s rural areas the number of older persons
increased by just 28 per cent over the same period. In Europe, the older population in rural areas
barely changed in size between 2000 and 2015, growing by just 2 per cent, at the same time the
older population in urban areas increased by 26 per cent. In general, the regions that are
urbanizing the fastest—Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Africa—saw the biggest
differentials in the growth of the number of older persons between urban and rural areas.

     The faster growth of the older population in urban areas compared to rural areas is likely
attributable both to trends in the urbanization of the population across all age groups and to
differences in mortality risks, which tend to be lower in urban areas relative to rural areas (see

Globally, the proportion of older persons residing in urban areas is higher than for other
age groups.

    In 2015, 58 per cent of older persons globally lived in urban areas, compared to 46 per cent
of children aged 0 to 14 years, 54 per cent of adolescents and youth aged 15 to 24 years and 57
per cent of people aged 25 to 59 years (figure II.10). The age patterns of urban residence vary
somewhat across regions. In Africa, both children and older persons were less likely to live in
urban areas than people in the working ages (37 per cent versus 44 per cent). In Asia, Europe and
Latin America and the Caribbean, the share residing in urban areas was similar across the 15-24,
25-59 and 60 or over age groups. In Northern America, older persons were somewhat less likely
to reside in urban areas (78 per cent) compared to children (82 per cent), adolescents and youth
(85 per cent), and people aged 25-59 years (82 per cent). In Oceania, older persons were
substantially more likely to live in urban areas relative to children aged 0-14 years (81 per cent
versus 60 per cent), reflecting the region’s concentration of older persons in the highly urbanized
countries of Australia and New Zealand and the comparatively young age structures of the more
rural populations of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.

    In 2015, 58 per cent of the world’s people aged 60 years or over resided in urban areas, up
from 51 per cent in 2000 (figure II.11). The oldest-old are even more likely to reside in urban
areas: the proportion of people aged 80 years or over residing in urban areas rose from 56 per
cent in 2000 to 63 per cent in 2015. In Oceania, more than 80 per cent of older persons resided in
urban areas and 90 per cent of the oldest-old resided in urban areas in 2015. In Northern America
and Latin America and the Caribbean, 76 per cent of older persons lived in urban areas in 2000
and the proportions rose to 78 per cent and 81 per cent in 2015 for the two regions, respectively.
More than 8 in 10 oldest-old persons in Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean
resided in urban areas in 2015.

    The share of older persons residing in urban areas in Europe rose from 68 per cent in 2000 to
72 per cent in 2015. Asia saw the largest increase in the proportion urban among its older
population: the percentage of those aged 60 years or over residing in urban areas increased from
37 per cent in 2000 to 49 per cent in 2015. The oldest-old population in Asia urbanized even
faster: 53 per cent of those aged 80 years or over lived in urban areas in 2015, up from 38 per
cent in 2000. In Africa, the world’s least urbanized region, close to 37 per cent of older persons
lived in urban areas in 2015, up from 31 per cent in 2000.


                                                    C. TRENDS IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OLDER PERSONS

    While growth in the number of older persons is an important trend in itself, the process of
population ageing, by definition, refers to an increasing proportion of older persons in a
population. Thus, ageing is determined not only by the pace of growth of the older population,
but also by how that pace compares to the growth rates of the other age groups.

Globally, the number of older persons is growing faster than the numbers of people in any
other age group.

    In 2015, there were 48 per cent more people aged 60 years or over worldwide than there were
in 2000, and by 2050, the number of older people is projected to have more than tripled since
2000 (figure II.12). In contrast, at the global level, the numbers of children under age 10 and
adolescents and youth aged 10-24 years will change very little: the projected numbers of children
and adolescents and youth in 2050 represents an 11 per cent increase over the year 2000. The
global number of adults aged 25-59 years is growing faster than the number of children, but not
as fast as the population aged 60 years or over. In 2015, there were 29 per cent more people aged
25-59 years than there were in 2000, and projections indicate that by 2050 there will be 62 per
cent more of them than in 2000.

     Historically, the population of older persons has been much smaller than any other of these
age groups. In 1960, for example, children under age 10 outnumbered people aged 60 years or
over by more than 3 to 1, and there were nearly five times as many people aged 25-59 years as
older persons (figure II.13). By 2000, however, the ratio of children to older persons had fallen to
2 to 1 (1.2 billion versus 0.6 billion), while that of people aged 25-59 to older persons had fallen
close to 4 to 1 (2.6 billion versus 0.6 billion) (figure II.14). By 2030, older persons are projected
to outnumber children aged 0-9 years (1.4 billion versus 1.3 billion); by 2050, there will be more
people aged 60 years or over than adolescents and youth aged 10-24 years (2.1 billion versus 2.0
billion).

    These shifts over time in the relative sizes of the various age groups have resulted in
increases in the proportion of the population at older ages. At the global level, the percentage of
older persons increased from close to 10 per cent in 2000 to over 12 per cent in 2015, when one
in every eight people worldwide was aged 60 years or over (table II.2). The proportion of older
persons globally is projected to continue to increase to more than 16 per cent in 2030 and over 21
per cent in 2050. Thus, by the middle of the twenty-first century, around one in every five
people globally will be aged 60 years or over.

    Older persons already constitute a large share of the population in the more developed
regions. In 2015, close to one in four people living in developed regions was aged 60 years or
over, and it is projected to continue to rise such that, in 2050, older persons will account for one
in three people in the developed regions. People aged 60 years or over comprised nearly 10 per
cent of the population in developing regions in 2015, and that share is projected to increase to 14
per cent in 2030 and to 20 per cent in 2050. Among the least developed countries, older persons
accounted for a relatively small fraction of the total population—5.5 per cent in 2015—but the
share of older persons in the least developed countries is also projected to increase in the coming
decades, reaching nearly 10 per cent in 2050.

High-income countries tend to be the most aged.

    Older persons comprised 22 per cent of the population of high-income countries in 2015, 13
per cent of upper-middle-income countries, 8 per cent of lower-middle-income countries and 5
per cent of low-income countries. Figure II.15 plots the percentage of the population aged 60
years or over in 2015 against each country’s gross national income per capita in 2014 for
countries with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2015 and for which a GNI estimate was available.
The size of the bubbles is proportional to the size of the population aged 60 years or over in
2015.

Japan is home to the world’s most aged population: 33 per cent were aged 60 years or over
in 2015.

    Japan is followed by Germany (28 per cent aged 60 years or over in 2015), Italy (28 per cent)
and Finland (27 per cent).6 Of the 62 high-income countries or areas with total population
greater than 90,000 in 2015, half had relatively aged populations in 2015, with 20 per cent of the
population aged 60 years or over. The proportion of older persons also exceeded 20 per cent
among several upper-middle-income European countries, such as Bulgaria (27 per cent aged 60
years or over in 2015) and Romania (22 per cent). Comparatively young age structures prevailed
among countries at the lower end of the income distribution: in every low-income country and 85
per cent of lower-middle-income countries in 2015, less than 10 per cent of the population was
aged 60 years or over.

By 2030 many middle-income countries will have aged considerably.

   Within the next 15 years, several upper-middle-income countries are projected to become as
aged as many of today’s high-income countries. Between 2015 and 2030, the share of population

aged 60 years or over is projected to increase from 15 per cent to 24 per cent in China, from 20
per cent to 32 per cent in Cuba, and from 16 per cent to 27 per cent in Thailand (figure II.16).
Some lower-middle-income countries are projected to age rapidly as well. For example, the
proportion aged 60 years or over is projected to increase from 13 per cent in 2015 to 20 per cent
in 2030 in Sri Lanka; from 10 to 18 per cent in Viet Nam; and from 8 to 14 per cent in Morocco.

    The population ageing process is much slower in low-income countries: in 89 per cent of
low-income countries and 62 per cent of lower-middle-income countries, the share of older
persons is projected to remain below 10 per cent through 2030.

    In 2000, of the world’s ten most aged populations all but one (Japan) were located in Europe
and the share of the population aged 60 years or over had not yet reached 25 per cent in any
country. In 2015 the share of older persons exceeded 25 per cent in all ten of the most aged
countries and, by 2030, older persons will comprise more than 32 per cent of the population in
each of the ten most aged countries or areas (table II.3). Europe is expected to account for 7 of
the 10 most aged countries in 2030. Projections indicate that in 2030, Martinique will be home to
the world’s most aged population, with 38.5 per cent aged 60 years or over. All three major
demographic processes have contributed to rapid population ageing in Martinique: sharp
reductions in total fertility, from 5.7 children per woman in the 1950s to 2.1 children per woman
in the 1980s; increasing longevity, with life expectancy at birth having risen from 56 years in
2010-2015 to around 81 years in 2010-2015; as well as net emigration of young people.

The pace of world population ageing is accelerating.

   Over the 15 years between 2000 and 2015, the proportion of the global population that was
aged 60 years or over increased by 2.3 percentage points, from 9.9 per cent to 12.3 per cent

(table II.2; figure II.17). Projections indicate that over the next 15 years the proportion aged 60
years or over globally will increase by 4.2 percentage points reaching 16.5 per cent in 2030.
Between 2000 and 2015, the pace of population ageing was fastest in Northern America (4.6
percentage point increase) and Europe (3.6 percentage points). The pace of population ageing is
projected to accelerate in all six regions. Between 2015 and 2030 projected increases in the
proportion aged 60 years or over are nearly identical for Asia (5.6 percentage point increase),
Europe (5.7), Latin America and the Caribbean (5.6) and Northern America (5.6).

   By 2050, older persons are projected to account for 34 per cent of the population of Europe,
28 per cent of Northern America, 26 per cent of Latin America and the Caribbean, 25 per cent of
Asia, 23 per cent of Oceania, and 9 per cent of Africa (figure II.18).

     In many developing countries, population ageing is taking place much more rapidly than it
did in the countries that developed earlier. For example, it took France 115 years, Sweden 85
years, Australia 73 years, the United States 69 years and the United Kingdom and Spain 45 years
each for the proportion of the population aged 60 years or over to increase from 7 to 14 per cent
(Kinsella and Gist, 1995). In contrast, it has taken China only 34 years and Thailand only 23
years to experience the same change in the share of older persons. Projections indicate that for
Brazil, it will take just 25 years for the percentage of older persons to rise from 7 to 14 per cent
and the same change in the proportion aged 60 years or over will take just 22 years in Colombia.

Thus, today’s developing countries have to adapt much more quickly to population ageing, and
often at much lower levels of national income compared to the past experience of many of the
countries that developed earlier.

    The pace of population ageing observed at the country level illustrates just how fast the age
structures are shifting in many parts of the world. Table II.4 lists the ten countries with the
largest percentage point changes in the share of older persons in 2000-2015 and projected for
2015-2030. Of countries or areas with 90,000 inhabitants or more in 2015, the United States
Virgin Islands experienced the fastest rise in the proportion of the population aged 60 years or
over, with an increase of nearly 11 percentage points between 2000 and 2015. Japan was the
next fastest (a 9.9 percentage point increase), followed by Malta (9.3), Finland (7.3) and the
Republic of Korea (7.2). Over the coming 15 years, the most rapidly ageing countries are
projected to experience increases in the proportion of older persons that are considerably faster
than those observed over the previous 15-year period. Cuba and the Republic of Korea, two
countries that have experienced both sharp declines in fertility and substantial gains in longevity
since the mid-twentieth century, are projected to see the largest change in the proportion aged 60
years or over between 2015 and 2030, with increases of nearly 13 percentage points. An
additional seven countries or areas are also projected to experience increases in the proportion of
older persons of more than 10 percentage points over the next 15 years.

In 2050, nearly half of the world’s population will live in countries or areas where at least
20 per cent of the population is aged 60 years or over, and one in four people will live in
countries or areas where older persons account for more than 30 per cent of the
population.

    In 2000, the share of the population aged 60 years or over exceeded 20 per cent in only 23
countries or areas7 and these contained just 9 per cent of the global population. Projections
indicate that the number of countries or areas where at least 20 per cent of the population is aged
60 years or over is projected to grow from a minority of 53 in 2015 to a large majority of 145 in
2050, and the share of the world’s people living in such countries or areas is projected to increase
from 17 per cent to 44 per cent. In 74 countries or areas, older persons are projected to make up
at least 30 per cent of the population in 2050, up from just 3 countries or areas8 in 2015.
Conversely, the number of countries with very young population age structures is shrinking over
time. While in 2015 there were 37 countries or areas where less than 5 per cent of the population
were aged 60 years or over, by 2050 the share of older persons is projected to be below 5 per
cent in only one country (Niger).

                              D. DEPENDENCY AND SUPPORT RATIOS

  Population ageing, which is driven by both declining fertility and increasing longevity,
implies that successive cohorts can expect to live longer and have fewer adult children as
potential sources of support in their old age. This section discusses trends in various descriptive
measures of population ageing that are used often to examine the implications of shifting
population age structures for intergenerational support systems.

    The total dependency ratio is a commonly used measure of potential support needs. It is
based on the notion of childhood and old age as periods of dependency during which persons
tend to rely upon the working-age population for financial support, which may be provided
directly through family transfers, or indicrectly through public transfer programmes. The total
dependency ratio is defined here as the ratio of the number of children and young people under
age 20 plus the number of persons aged 65 years or over, to the number of persons aged 20 to 64
years. The ratio provides an indication of how many dependents need to be supported by each
person of working age, on average. The actual ages of dependency vary considerably from
country to country and from one person to another, since factors like the pursuit of higher
education or youth unemployment often prolong the dependent period beyond age 20, while
personal preferences, as well as health and financial considerations, influence the age at which
people retire from the workforce. Despite these limitations, the choice of the age range 20 to 64
years for the working ages serves here as a starting point to facilitate comparisons of age
structures across populations and over time.

The global total dependency ratio has fallen to a historical minimum and is set to rise in the
post-2015 period.

    At the global level, the total dependency ratio has fallen to a historical minimum in 2015
(figure II.20). From a peak of approximately 112 “dependents” per 100 working-age persons in
the early-1970s, the total dependency ratio declined steadily in response to sustained reductions
in global fertility, to reach 74 dependents per 100 working-age persons in 2015. The total
dependency ratio is projected to increase gradually over the coming decades together with the
growing proportion of older persons. By 2030, there will be 76 people in the dependent ages per
100 working-age people, and by 2050 the global total dependency ratio is projected to rise to 79
dependents per 100 working-age persons. A rising ratio indicates that there will be slightly more
dependents to be supported by each person of working ages.

The total dependency ratio is projected to increase in all regions except Africa.

    The total dependency ratio is projected to rise the fastest in regions that have already seen
substantial increases in the proportion of older persons, such as Europe and Northern America.
As a result of several decades of comparatively low fertility, the total dependency ratios in
Europe and Northern America were lower than in the other regions in the second half of the
twentieth century. In 2015, the total dependency ratios in these two regions were 62 and 67
dependents per 100 working-age persons, respectively, which were similar to that in Asia at 66
dependents per 100 working-age persons, and slightly lower than in Latin America and the

regions. The increasing proportions of older persons in Asia and Latin America and the
Caribbean will also boost future increases in the total dependency ratio, which, in 2050, is

America and the Caribbean in 2050.

    Fertility decline began more recently in Africa than in the other regions, and thus the
proportion of children is starting to fall and the share of working-age persons is beginning to
increase, while the proportion of older persons in the population remains fairly small. As a result,
the total dependency ratio in Africa is falling gradually, and that decline is projected to continue
into the second half of the twenty-first century. The dependency ratio in Africa fell from its peak
of 140 dependents per 100 working-age persons in the mid-1980s to 121 dependents per 100
working-age persons in 2015, and is projected to continue to decline to 91 dependents per 100
working-age persons in 2050.

The global increase in the total dependency ratio will be driven by a growing share of older
persons.

    Changes in the total dependency ratio are driven by changes in the proportions of children
and of older persons. Figure II.21 illustrates the distribution of people in the dependent ages in
the world, distinguishing children and young people under 20 years of age and older persons
aged 65 years or over. In 1950, the vast majority of dependents worldwide were children, while
older persons accounted for just 10 per cent of the global dependent-age population. Since the
mid-1960s, however, the share of older persons among the world’s dependents has grown,
reaching 20 per cent in 2015, and is expected to continue to grow steadily into the future.
Projections indicate that in 2050 older persons will account for 36 per cent of people in the
dependent ages worldwide.

The economic support ratio takes into account the age patterns of production and
consumption to describe the number of effective workers in a population relative to the
number of effective consumers.

    Rather than assuming a status of “dependency” at given ages, a better way to assess the
degree of dependency in a population is to consider the age patterns of production and
consumption. Age patterns of production reflect labour earnings and represent the economic
contribution of individuals at each age to their own sustenance and to the support of others. In
turn, the age patterns of consumption provide a measure of the population’s needs at each age.
While these economic factors are at best implicit in the conventional demographic dependency
ratios, the economic support ratio makes them explicit, and considers them together with the
population age structure.

    The economic support ratio is defined as the effective number of workers divided by the
effective number of consumers in a given population (Lee and Mason, 2011; United Nations,
2013). The effective number of workers is obtained by the product of the labour income at each
age by the population in the corresponding age group, summed over all ages. Age variations in
labour force participation, hours worked, unemployment and wages are taken into account and
are reflected in the country-specific labour income profile. Similarly, the effective number of
consumers is calculated as the sum over all ages of the product of consumption at each age by
the population in that age group.

    Figure II.22 shows the average annual changes in the economic support ratio in different
countries, estimated for the period 1980-2015 and projected for 2015-2050, based on information
on the labour income and consumption age profiles for recent years compiled in the National
Transfer Accounts (NTA) database,9 together with United Nations estimates and projections of
population by age and sex. A rising economic support ratio, reflected in a positive growth rate in
figure II.22, means that, during the reference time period, each worker is supporting fewer
consumers, on average. This situation is favourable for economic development, since it frees up
resources that can be used to increase per capita consumption, savings and investment, thereby
fuelling further economic growth (Lee and Mason, 2011). Conversely, a declining support ratio,
reflected in a negative growth rate, means that there are fewer equivalent producers to support
each equivalent consumer, which constrains the present standard of living and future economic
growth.

Countries that underwent a rapid fertility decline between the 1970s and 1990s benefitted
from increasing economic support ratios during the period 1980-2015.

    Growth of the economic support ratio over 1980-2015 was particularly high in several Asian
countries, such as China, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam, where the average
annual growth rate ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 per cent (figure II.22, top chart). The rate of growth of
the economic support ratio growth during that period was still significant in Brazil, Colombia
and South Africa, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 per cent per year. In contrast, the growth rate was
comparatively modest in high-income countries that had already achieved low fertility: Australia,
France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States show growth rates of the economic
support ratio in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 per cent annually over 1980-2015. In countries with very
low fertility, such as Japan, the economic support ratio actually declined during that period.

Increasing economic support ratios are projected to contribute to future economic growth
in a number of middle-income and low-income countries.

   Economic support ratios, projected under the assumption that age patterns of production and
consumption remain unchanged over 2015-2050, illustrate at the potential influence of
demographic changes on economic growth10 (figure II.22, bottom panel). For example, In India
and Indonesia, the economic support ratio is projected to continue growing over the period 2015-
2050, boosting economic growth by about 0.2 per cent per year. In Nigeria and Kenya, the
economic support ratios are expected to increase even faster, resulting in an addition to economic
growth of 0.3 per cent per year over the period 2015-2050, on average.11

   These results are obtained by multiplying the latest available age-specific patterns of production of consumption (see footnote 8), by the
population by age of the medium projection variant of the World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision (United Nations, 2015).
11
   If fertility declines faster than anticipated in the medium variant, if investment in human and physical capital increase, or labour markets
improve, then the actual future growth rate of the economic support ratio would be higher than shown in figure II.22.

Many high-income and upper-middle-income countries will experience declining economic
support ratios, especially where populations are already aged.

    Other things being equal, the declining economic support ratios projected between 2015 and
2050 would contribute to dampen economic growth in Japan and in Spain, for example, by about
0.5 per cent per year and 0.8 per cent per year, respectively. In the United States, where the
ageing process is less advanced due to somewhat higher fertility and mortality than in other high-
income countries as well as to significant inflow of migrants, the projected changes in the
economic support ratio is smaller, of less than 0.3 per cent per year. The support ratios in
Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay are projected to decline slightly, with ensuing lesser
effects on economic growth, of only -0.05 per cent per year during 2015-2050.

    In many upper-middle-income countries, the share of the working-age population is presently
reaching a peak. In the coming decades, these countries are expected to experience accelerated
population ageing and declining economic support ratios, reaching levels similar to those of the
high-income countries today. The decline in the support ratio is projected to be more pronounced
in countries with more aged populations, such as China, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea,
Spain, Slovenia and Thailand, where the economic support ratios are projected to decline by
more than 0.5 per cent per year over 2015-2050.

           III. Demographic drivers of population ageing

    The size and age composition of a population are determined jointly by three demographic
processes: fertility, mortality and migration. Fertility levels and trends determine the size of each
birth cohort; while mortality levels and trends determine what proportion of those cohorts
eventually survive to old age. Age patterns of immigration and emigration also influence the age
distribution of the population, although to a lesser extent than fertility and mortality in most
countries. This chapter describes the relationships between the three main demographic
processes and population ageing, drawing primarily upon United Nations population estimates
and projections from World Population Prospects: the 2015 Revision.

               A. FERTILITY AND MORTALITY AS DETERMINANTS OF TRENDS IN THE NUMBERS OF
                                                                  OLDER PERSONS

    The present growth rate of the population of older persons is a function of the levels of
fertility prevailing some 60 years ago when today’s new cohorts of older persons were born,
together with the likelihood that members of those birth cohorts survived to older ages. Figure
III.1 shows the growth rate of the population aged 60 or over in 2010-2015 versus the total
fertility rate (expressed as the average number of children per woman) 60 years earlier, in 1950-
1955, for countries or areas with at least 500,000 residents aged 60 years or older in 2015.12

In general, countries that had high fertility 60 years ago saw faster growth in the number
of older persons during 2010-2015.

    In the Philippines, for example, the total fertility rate was 7.4 children per woman in 1950-
1955, and today, the number of older people (aged 60 years or over) is growing rapidly, at an
average 3.6 per cent per year in 2010-2015. By contrast, in Italy, total fertility was only 2.4
children per woman in 1950-1955, and today’s older population is growing much slower than in
the Philippines, at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent during 2010-2015. Because fertility
rates in the mid-century were high—above five children per woman—in many parts of Africa,
Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, the growth rates of the older populations in those
regions are significantly higher than in Europe, where fertility in 1950-1955 had already fallen
below three children per woman in many countries.

    The association between past fertility rates and the present rates of growth of the numbers of
older persons across countries shown in Figure III.1 is tempered by variation in mortality risks
across countries with similar levels of fertility. For example, in Mexico, where total fertility was
6.8 children per woman in 1950-1955, the average annual growth rate of the population of older
persons in 2010-2015 was 4.1 per cent, but in Côte d’Ivoire, where total fertility at 6.8 children
per woman in 1950-1955 was similar to that in Mexico, the growth rate of the older population in
2010-2015 was only around half that in Mexico, at 2.3 per cent. The difference can be explained
largely by the disparate mortality risks between the two countries: people born in Mexico during

12
   Looking at fertility levels some 60-80 or even 90 years prior, would offer a more complete illustration of how past fertility drives the pace of
growth of the older population. However, given that there are no internationally comparable time series of fertility estimates before 1950, the
period 60 years in the past is used as a first approximation for this analysis.

the mid-twentieth century were twice as likely to survive to old age as those born in Côte
d’Ivoire. More specifically, an estimated 66 per cent of babies born in Mexico in 1950-1955
survived to celebrate their 60th birthdays in 2010-2015, compared to just 33 per cent of their
peers born in Côte d’Ivoire (figure III.2).13 Persons born in Côte d’Ivoire at the mid-century were
twice as likely as their counterparts in Mexico to die before age five and excess mortality
associated with armed conflict and the HIV/AIDS epidemic contributed the lower probabilities
of survival to older ages there as well.

    A similar comparison can be made for China and Nigeria. While total fertility rates in both
China and Nigeria were similar at the mid-century at 6.1 and 6.4 children per woman,
respectively, the older population in China in 2010-2015 was growing nearly twice as fast as in
Nigeria (4.6 per cent versus 2.4 per cent per year) owing in part to the greater survival to old age
of people in China. An estimated 66 per cent of the people born in China in 1950-1955 survived
to their 60th birthdays compared to 37 per cent of those born in Nigeria.

    Table III.1 lists the current size and growth rate of the population of older persons for the
world and six regions, as well as the fertility rates around the time that today’s 60-year-olds were
born and their survival probabilities to age 60.2 In 2010-2015, the population of older persons
was growing most rapidly in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, at an average 3.8 per
cent per year. Both of these regions were characterized by high fertility in 1950-1955, at 5.8 and
5.9 children per woman, respectively. Moreover, a majority of the 1950-1955 birth cohorts
survived to old age: 59 per cent of those born in Asia during 1950-1955 were still alive at age 60,
as were 65 per cent of those born in Latin America and the Caribbean.

    The older populations of Northern America and Oceania were also growing rapidly during
2010-2015, by 3.1 per cent annually in 2010-2015, despite having had much lower fertility
compared to Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia at the mid-century (3.4 and 3.8 children
per woman, respectively). In both Northern America and Oceania, growth of the older population
has been bolstered by high probabilities of survival to older ages: close to 85 per cent of the
1950-1955 birth cohort in Northern America lived to at least age 60, as did 78 per cent of their
peers in Oceania.

    The pace of growth of the older population in Africa, at 3.0 per cent per year during 2010-
2015, was similar to that in Northern America and Oceania, although the probability of survival
to age 60 years in Africa was much lower, with just 42 per cent of those born in 1950-1955


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                      43


surviving to their 60th birthdays. In this instance, very high fertility, at 6.6 children per woman in
1950-1955, has compensated for lower survival to old age to promote rapid growth of the
population of older persons in Africa.

    While Europe is home to the world’s most aged population in 2015, the pace of growth of the
older population in Europe was the slowest of the six regions during 2010-2015, at 1.7 per cent
per year on average, owing to already low fertility in Europe in 1950-1955 at 2.7 children per
woman, and a lower probability of survival to older ages relative to Northern America, with 76
per cent of Europe’s 1950-1955 birth cohort alive at age 60 years.

Global trends in the growth rate of the older population reveal the powerful influence of
major historical events in shaping the age composition of the world’s population.

    Figure III.3 plots the average annual rates of change of the global population aged 60 years
or over and aged 80 years or over, respectively, by 5-year period, estimated since 1950 and
projected until 2050. The sharp fluctuations observed in the growth rate of the population of
older persons point to the historical events that produced significant demographic shocks during
the early- to mid-twentieth century. For example, the sharp decline in the growth rate of the
global population aged 80 years or over in the late 1990s marks the period during which the
cohorts born around World War I and affected by the 1918 influenza pandemic would have
reached their 80s. Similarly, the decline in the growth rate of the global population aged 60 years
or over in 2000-2005 marks the period during which the cohorts born during the period of lower
fertility surrounding World War II would have turned 60 years old; the projected decline in the
growth rate of the population aged 80 years or over in 2020-2025 marks when they would have
turned 80 years old.

    Of the three demographic processes, historically fertility has been the most influential in
shaping trends in the numbers and proportion of older persons in the population over the long
term. Total fertility rates have fallen in each of the world’s regions. That decline, which is
described in the demographic transition, began first in Europe, Northern America and the
developed countries of Oceania as far back as the late nineteenth-century. Since the mid-
twentieth century, fertility decline has followed in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
Africa.

    Figure III.4 illustrates trends in total fertility for the world and six regions, estimated for
1950 to 2015 and projected to 2050 from the 2015 Revision of World Population Prospects. At
the global level, total fertility in 1950 was just above 5 children per woman and it has fallen to
around 2.5 children per woman in 2015. That global decline reflects reductions in fertility in all
six regions. The steepest declines in fertility since 1950 occurred in Asia and Latin America and
the Caribbean, where total fertility fell from around 6 children per woman in the mid-twentieth
century to around 2.1 children per woman in 2015, which is the level of fertility required to
sustain population size over the long term and is referred to as the replacement rate.

    Total fertility rates in Oceania, Northern America and Europe were comparatively lower in
1950, at around 3.7, 3.1, and 2.6 children per woman, respectively. Following a brief increase in
fertility in the 1950s and early 1960s, fertility decline resumed in these regions. In 2015, total
fertility rates had fallen to close to 2.4 children per woman in Oceania, 1.9 children per woman
in Northern America, and 1.6 children per woman in Europe. Total fertility was highest in

Africa in 1950, at 6.6 children per woman on average, and while women in Africa had two fewer
children on average in 2015 than they did in 1950, the region’s total fertility rate of 4.6 children
per woman remained the highest in the world.

    Projections of future fertility indicate that rates in Africa will continue to fall towards 3.0
children per woman in 2050. Fertility rates in Oceania, Asia and Latin America are also
projected to decline, although only slightly, from their 2015 levels, while those in Northern
America and Europe are projected to increase, again only slightly from their 2015 levels.

     The regional trends in total fertility illustrated in figure III.4 are closely linked to the
observed and projected regional trends in the growth of the population of older persons. Figure
III.5 charts the estimated and projected regional trends in the average annual rate of change of
the population aged 60 years or over from 1980 to 2050 for each of the six regions.

    The influence of the post-World War II baby boom is evident in the spike in the growth rates
of the populations of older persons in the early twenty-first century in Europe, Northern America
and Oceania. From 2015, the growth of the population aged 60 years or over is projected to slow
in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America and Oceania, reflecting the
reductions in fertility that led to slowing in the growth of birth cohorts through the latter half of
the twentieth century. In Asia, the growth rate of the population of older persons is projected to

decline precipitously after 2025, reflecting the rapid decline in fertility that began in the mid-
1960s in that region. In Africa, the pace of growth of the population aged 60 years or over is
projected to increase from just over 3 per cent per year in 2010-2015 reaching nearly 3.9 per cent
per year in 2040-2045, reflecting the higher fertility rates in the region. The pace of growth of
the older population of Africa projected for the 2040s is faster than any region has experienced
since 1950 when the data series begins.


       C. TRENDS IN LIFE EXPECTANCIES AND PROBABILITIES OF SURVIVAL TO OLD AGE

    As fertility rates fall over time, the size of birth cohorts stabilizes and improvements in
longevity become increasingly important drivers of population ageing. Fertility in Europe has
been well below the replacement level for more than three decades, thus variations across
countries in the rate of growth of the older population are increasingly influenced by disparities
in the likelihood of survival to old age. A similar situation is emerging in Northern America and
is anticipated to occur in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean where fertility decline began
more recently. This section examines past, present and future mortality risks as summarized in
terms of the life expectancies at birth and at age 60, as well as the cohort probabilities of survival
to older ages.

All regions have experienced substantial increases in life expectancy since 1950.

    The life expectancy at birth describes the number of years a person would be expected to live
if he or she were exposed throughout life to the prevailing age-specific mortality risks of a given
period. Figure III.6 shows the life expectancy at birth for the world and six regions estimated for
1950 to 2015 and projected to 2050 from the 2015 Revision of World Population Prospects. In
2010-2015, life expectancy at birth globally was 70.5 years, having risen from 46.8 years in
1950-1955. Across the six regions in 2010-2015, the expectation of life at birth was longest in
Northern America, at 79.2 years, and shortest in Africa, at 59.5 years. All regions have
experienced an increase in life expectancy since 1950, with the fastest increases occurring in
Asia, where life expectancy at birth increased from 42.1 years in 1950-1955 to 71.6 years in
2010-2015, and in Latin America and the Caribbean, where it rose from 51.2 years to 74.5 years
over the same period.

    Improvements in the life expectancy at birth can be driven by mortality decline at various
ages. Decomposing the change in life expectancy at birth according to the contribution of
mortality reductions among different age groups offers insight into how the drivers of
improvements in life expectancy vary across populations at different levels of mortality. The
results of this decomposition exercise are shown in figure III.7, which illustrates the contribution
of mortality decline below age 5 years, between ages 5 and 59 years, and at age 60 years or over,
respectively, to the overall increases in life expectancy at birth between 1995-2000 and 2010-
2015 for the world and six regions. At the global level, improved survival between birth and age
5 accounted for close to half of the 4.9-year increase in the life expectancy at birth between
1995-2000 and 2010-2015. Mortality reductions between ages 5 and 59 years and at age 60
years or over each accounted for 25 per cent of the global gain in the life expectancy at birth over
that period.

age groups is that developed by Arriaga (1984) and described in Preston, Heuveline and Guillot (2001), p. 65.




United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                                                                                            49


Improvements in survival at age 60 or over accounted for more than half of the total
improvement in longevity in Oceania, Europe and Northern America, while reduced
mortality at younger ages was more important in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the
Caribbean.

    Africa, the region with the largest gain in life expectancy at birth since 1995-2000 (7.3
years), attributed a majority of that increase (54 per cent) to improved survival among children
under five. Reductions in mortality at age 60 years or over contributed 0.6 years (9 per cent) to
the overall increase in life expectancy at birth in Africa. Across the six regions, the largest
fraction of the total increase in life expectancy at birth due to reduced mortality at older ages
occurred in Northern America, where 71 per cent of the 2.6-year improvement in longevity was
due to reduced mortality above age 60. Mortality reductions at older ages accounted for more
than half of the total increase in the life expectancy at birth in Europe and Oceania as well. In
Latin America and the Caribbean, life expectancy increased by just over four years between
1995-2000 and 2010-2015 and 39 per cent of that gain was due to reductions in mortality risks at
age 60 years or over. Asia added five years to the life expectancy at birth between 1995-2000
and 2010-2015 and while most of that gain was due to mortality reductions among children
under five years, 23 per cent was attributable to reduced mortality at age 60 years or over.

As the life expectancy at birth increases, improvements in survival at older ages account
for a growing proportion of the overall improvement in longevity.

    Figure III.8 shows the percentage contribution of increases in the life expectancy at age 60
(both sexes combined) to overall improvements in longevity between 1995-2000 and 2010-2015
versus the life expectancy at birth in 2010-2015 among the 195 countries or areas with at least
90,000 inhabitants in 2015 and for which life expectancy at birth increased over the period.
Among those countries with low life expectancy at birth, below 65 years, most of which are
located in sub-Saharan Africa, changes in survival probabilities above age 60 accounted for only
a small fraction of the change in life expectancy since 1995, at well under 20 per cent in most
cases. Examples include Nigeria, where 3.7 per cent of the total 6.0-year increase in life
expectancy at birth between 1995-2000 and 2010-2015 was attributable to improved survival at
age 60 or over, and Papua New Guinea, where improved survival at older ages accounted for
14.5 per cent of the overall 4.3-year increase in the life expectancy at birth. At the other end of
the spectrum, in countries with life expectancy at birth above 75 years, a majority of the
improvement in overall longevity was due to improvements in survival above age 60. Reduced
mortality at older ages accounted for more than 70 per cent of the net improvement in several
countries, including Canada, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the
United States.

    Defined similarly to the life expectancy at birth, the life expectancy at age 60 reflects the
number of additional years a 60-year-old person would be expected to live if exposed throughout
the remainder of life to the prevailing age-specific mortality rates of a given period. In 2010-
2015, 60-year-old persons globally could expect to live an additional 20.2 years on average.
Across the six regions, the life expectancy at age 60 was highest in Northern America and
Oceania, at 23.5 years and 23.7 years, respectively, and lowest in Africa, at 16.7 years.

    Table III.2 lists the life expectancies at birth and at age 60 for both sexes combined and for
each sex separately for the world and six regions. Women tend to live longer than men, on
average, a phenomenon linked to both biological and behavioural health advantages of women.
At the global level in 2010-2015, women’s life expectancy at birth exceeded that of men by 4.5
years. The female advantage in survival from birth was largest in Europe (7.1 years) and Latin
America and the Caribbean (6.7 years), and lowest in Africa (2.7 years) and Asia (3.8 years).
The female survival advantage persists at older ages. Globally in 2010-2015, 60-year-old
women could expect to outlive 60-year-old men by an average 2.8 years and, as with life
expectancy at birth, the female survival advantage at age 60 was greatest in Europe (4.0 years)
and smallest in Africa (1.5 years).


As with life expectancy at birth, all regions have experienced improvements in the life
expectancy at age 60, and are projected to continue to see improvements in survival at
older ages over the coming decades.

    Figure III.9 shows the life expectancy at age 60 by sex and for both sexes combined for each
of the six regions estimated for the period 1950 to 2015 and projected to 2050. In Africa, the life
expectancy at age 60 for both sexes combined rose from 12.5 years in 1950-1955 to 16.7 years in
2010-2015 and is projected to rise further to 19.3 years in 2045-2050. Women in Africa have
seen greater advances in survival at older ages on average than men: the female advantage in life
expectancy at age 60 widened from 1.0 years in 1950-1955 to 1.5 years in 2010-2015 and is
anticipated to widen further to 2.1 years in 2045-2050.

    At the mid-twentieth century, life expectancy at age 60 in Asia was similar to that in Africa,
at 12.1 years for both sexes combined. Yet advances in survival at older ages have outpaced
those in Africa such that by 2010-2015, the expectation of life at age 60 in Asia had grown to
19.4 years. Improvements in survival at older ages have progressed at a similar pace in Latin
America and the Caribbean, where the life expectancy at age 60 for both sexes combined
increased from 15.1 years in 1950-1955 to 21.8 years in 2010-2015. Both in Asia and in Latin
America and the Caribbean, the sex difference in the life expectancy at age 60 widened over
time. From a gender gap of less than two years in the 1970s, the female advantage in life
expectancy at age 60 in 2010-2015 has grown to 2.5 years in Asia and to 3.3 years in Latin
America and the Caribbean.

    In Europe, Northern America and Oceania, life expectancy at age 60 ranged from 16 to 17
years in 1950-1955. By 2010-2015, Oceania had added 7.5 years to the life expectancy at age 60;
Europe added 5.7; and Northern America added 4.2 years. After widening between 1950 and
1980, the sex differences in life expectancy at older ages in both Northern America and Oceania
began to decline, tobacco use, which increased later among women than among men, began to
influence similarly their mortality risks (Preston, Glei and Wilmoth, 2010). In Northern America
in particular, the female advantage in survival after age 60 narrowed from close to five years in
1975-1980 to three years in 2010-2015. In Europe, the female advantage in survival after age 60
has remained above four years since 1975-1980, due largely to persistent excess mortality risks
associated with non-communicable diseases and injuries among males in Eastern Europe (Leon,
2011). A recent study from the World Health Organization attributed the increases in life
expectancies at older ages in high-income countries to reductions in tobacco-related mortality

among men and reductions in cardiovascular-disease mortality among both men and women
(Mathers and others, 2015).

    Projections indicate that the life expectancy at age 60 will continue to increase in all regions
(figure III.9; table III.3). By 2045-2050 the number of additional years a 60-year-old person can
expect to live, on average, is expected to increase by 2.9 years at the global level for women and
by 3.2 years for men. Men in Latin America and the Caribbean are projected to experience the
largest increase in the life expectancy at age 60 by 2045-2050, with an additional 4.0 years,

  followed by women in the same region and men in Northern America, each with projected
  increases in the life expectancy at age 60 of 3.7 years. While improvements in survival at older
  ages are projected to be slower in Africa than in the other regions, still the life expectancy at age
  60 is projected to increase by 2.9 years among women and 2.3 years among men between 2010-
  2015 and 2045-2050.

     While the life expectancies at birth and at age 60 give a useful summary of the mortality risks
  experienced in a population at a single point in time, the probabilities of survival experienced by
  different birth cohorts are also instructive on how the mortality risks that people experience over
  their lifetimes differ according to the year and location of birth. Figure III.10 shows the
  probabilities of survival to ages 60 and 80 estimated for the 1950-1955 birth cohort, whose
  survivors were between 60 and 65 years old in 2015, as well as those projected for the 2000-
  2005 birth cohort, whose survivors were just 10 to 15 years old in 2015 and will celebrate their
  60th birthdays in 2060-2065

     A majority of the 1950-1955 birth cohort survived to age 60 in all regions except Africa,
  where just 45 per cent of women and 40 per cent of men lived to their 60th birthdays. Of those
  born in 1950-1955, women born in Northern America were the most likely to survive to age 60
  (89 per cent), followed by women in Europe (82 per cent), women in Oceania and men in
  Northern America (81 per cent), men in Oceania (76 per cent), women in Latin America and the
  Caribbean (70 per cent), men in Europe (69 per cent), men in Latin America and the Caribbean
  and women in Asia (61 per cent), and men in Asia (58 per cent).

    Among the 2000-2005 birth cohort, however, projections indicate that more than 8 in 10 men
  and women will survive to age 60 in every region but Africa, and the probability of survival to
  age 60 will exceed 90 per cent among women in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean,
  Northern America and Oceania, as well as among men in Northern America. Substantial

increases in survival to age 60 are projected for Africa: of those born in the region in 2000-2005,
71 per cent of females and 66 per cent of males are projected to survive to age 60.

    Not only are substantially more people projected to reach old age in the future, but more
older people than ever before are projected to survive to age 80 years or over. Among those born
in 1950-1955, majorities of women in Europe, Northern America and Oceania are projected to
survive to age 80, as are slight majorities of men in Northern America and Oceania. In most of
the world, however, survival to age 80 is expected to be comparatively rare among those born at
the mid-century. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 47 per cent of women and 34 per cent of
men born in 1950-1955 are projected to survive to age 80; in Asia, it’s 35 per cent of women and
27 per cent of men; and in Africa it’s 19 per cent of women and 14 per cent of men.

    Projected survival to age 80 among the 2000-2005 birth cohort show marked improvements
in all regions compared to the cohorts born 50 years earlier. Among the 2000-2005 birth cohort,
survival to age 80 is expected to be the norm everywhere but in Africa. Around 8 in 10 women
born in Northern America and Europe in 2000-2005 are projected to survive to age 80.
Probabilities of survival to age 80 among the 2000-2005 birth cohort also exceed 70 per cent
among women in Latin America and the Caribbean and Oceania and men in Northern America.
While those born in Africa are least likely to survive to advanced older ages, still 43 per cent of
women and 33 per cent of men born in Africa during 2000-2005 are projected to live to their 80th
birthdays.

    The accuracy of projections of life expectancy at older ages will depend on the degree of
progress achieved in preventing or postponing mortality caused by many of the diseases
associated with old age, in particular non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular
diseases, cancers, diabetes and respiratory diseases. Table III.4 lists the ten leading causes of
death to those aged 60 years or over globally, by sex, for the year 2012.

    Cardiovascular diseases, which include heart diseases and stroke, accounted for the largest
proportion of deaths among older persons worldwide in 2012. Ischaemic heart disease was the
leading cause of death among older men, causing close to 18 per cent of deaths, followed by
stroke, which was responsible for another 16 per cent of deaths to men aged 60 years or over.
Among older women globally, there were slightly more stroke deaths than deaths due to
ischaemic heart disease in 2012; each cause contributed over 18 per cent of deaths to women
aged 60 years or over. Hypertensive heart disease accounted for an additional 2.4 per cent of
deaths to older men and 3.4 per cent of deaths to older women.

    Apart from cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower
respiratory infections, diabetes mellitus and lung cancer (including trachea and bronchus
cancers) rank among the ten leading causes of death to both men and women aged 60 years or
over globally. Cancers of the stomach, prostate and liver are among the ten leading causes of
death to older men, while Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer and kidney diseases rank among the
ten leading causes of death to older women.


 D. FERTILITY AND MORTALITY AS DETERMINANTS OF TRENDS IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OLDER
                                                     PERSONS

    The contribution of the demographic transition to the increasing share of older persons in a
population can be understood through “population pyramids” that illustrate changes in the size
and age structure of a population over time. Figure III.11 contains the population pyramids for
three countries—Germany, Brazil and the United Republic of Tanzania—corresponding to three
points in time in order to illustrate the implications of the fertility and mortality shifts that
characterize the demographic transition for changes in the age distribution of the population.

Population ageing is an inevitable consequence of the demographic transition.

    The demographic transition began first in Europe and Northern America, where fertility
reductions took place over the past two centuries, contributing to their relatively aged population
age structures today. In Germany, the total fertility rate in 1950 was 2.1 children per woman,
and the proportion of the population aged 60 years or over was just under 15 per cent. Fertility
continued to fall in Germany to 1.4 children per woman in 2015, while the proportion of older
persons nearly doubled to 28 per cent. While fertility rates in Germany are expected to increase
somewhat in the coming decades, they are likely to remain below the replacement level of 2.1
children per woman, and, by 2050, the percentage aged 60 years or over is projected to reach 39
per cent.

    The demographic transition began later in most of Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean
and thus their populations are youthful compared to Europe and Northern America. In Brazil,
fertility in 1950 was 6.2 children per woman, on average, and just 5 per cent of the population
was aged 60 years or over. But starting around 1960 fertility declined rapidly in Brazil to 1.8
children per woman in 2015, and it is projected to remain below replacement at least through
2050. Fertility decline has occurred much faster in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean
than in the more developed regions and thus the populations of Asia and Latin America and the

Caribbean are ageing more rapidly. The share of Brazil’s population aged 60 years or over, for
example, is projected to increase from 12 per cent in 2015 to 29 per cent in 2050.

    Many countries in Africa remain in the early stages of the demographic transition: some have
begun to see reductions in fertility only recently, while others have yet to see a significant
decline in fertility. As a result, while the numbers of older persons have grown, their share of the
overall population has remained fairly small. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example,
total fertility in 2015, at 5.1 children per woman, was still comparatively high, although it had
fallen from 6.7 children per woman in 1950. Consequently, there has been little change in the
proportion of older persons in Tanzania: it increased only slightly, from 4 per cent in 1950 to 5
per cent in 2015. Fertility in Tanzania is projected to continue a relatively slow decline towards
3.3 children per woman in 2050 and the percentage of the population aged 60 years or over is
projected to rise gradually to reach 7 per cent by the mid-century.

    The size of the population of older persons over the near term is fairly certain, since: 1) the
people who will be aged 60 years or over in 2030 are today’s population aged 45 years or over;
and 2) adult mortality risks tend to change slowly over time. The size of the population of
children, however, is less certain, since total fertility rates can shift relatively quickly. This
uncertainty in the future numbers of children shapes the uncertainty associated with projections
of the proportion of older persons over the medium- to long-term.

    Figure III.12 displays the proportion of the population aged 60 years or over projected in the
medium variant, as well as two alternative hypothetical fertility scenarios for three countries with
disparate levels of fertility in 2015. The high-fertility scenario illustrates what the proportion of
older persons would be if the total fertility rate were 0.5 children per woman higher than in the
medium variant projection, while the low-fertility scenario illustrates that proportion if the
fertility rate were 0.5 children per woman lower than in the medium variant projection.

    In Japan where total fertility averaged 1.5 children per woman in 2015, the population has
aged rapidly over the past 65 years, from 8 per cent aged 60 years or over in 1950 to 33 per cent
in 2015. According to the medium variant projection, fertility in Japan will remain well below
the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman and Japan’s population will continue to age,
reaching 37 per cent aged 60 years or over in 2030 and 42 per cent in 2050. However, if future
fertility differs from the medium variant, the population ageing process in Japan could be
accelerated or slowed. If future total fertility is 0.5 children per woman lower than in the
medium variant projection, the proportion aged 60 years or over in 2050 will be 4 percentage
points higher, at close to 47 per cent, while if it is 0.5 children per woman higher than in the
medium variant projection, the proportion of older persons in 2050 will be more than 3
percentage points lower, at 39 per cent. However, since both the high- and low-fertility
scenarios fall well outside the 95 per cent prediction interval associated with probabilistic
projections of total fertility in Japan (data not shown), deviation of this magnitude from the
medium variant projection of the proportion of older persons is highly unlikely.

    In countries where total fertility has been higher than in Japan and the pace of population
ageing has been slower, variations in projected fertility of 0.5 children per woman in either
direction yield smaller changes to the projected proportion of older persons for 2050. In Pakistan
for example, total fertility remained above six children per woman until 1990 when birth rates
began to fall precipitously, reaching 3.4 children per woman in 2015. Reflecting persistently high
historical fertility levels, the proportion aged 60 years or over in Pakistan declined somewhat
between 1950 and 1970, from close to 8 per cent to just under 6 per cent, and has risen only
slightly since then to 6.6 per cent in 2015. Recent fertility declines are projected to yield
accelerated population ageing in Pakistan in the coming decades, however, with the proportion
of older persons expected to increase to 8 per cent in 2030 and to close to 13 per cent in 2050.
Projection scenarios with a trajectory of the total fertility rate 0.5 children per woman lower or
higher than the medium variant produce projected proportions aged 60 years or over in 2050 for
Pakistan that range from 11.6 per cent in the high-fertility scenario to 14.5 per cent in the low
fertility scenario. Unlike for Japan, the high- and low-fertility scenarios for Pakistan fall within
the 95 per cent prediction interval of the probabilistic projections of total fertility, but at the
margins of the 80 per cent prediction interval.

    Fertility decline in Nigeria began relatively recently and thus the country has not yet
experienced an increase in the proportion of older persons. In 2015, 4.5 per cent of Nigeria’s
population was aged 60 years or over and that proportion is projected to change only slightly (to
4.8 per cent) through 2030. By 2050, however, the proportion of older persons in Nigeria is
expected to have begun to grow more significantly, reaching 6.3 per cent in the medium variant
projection, 7.0 per cent if total fertility falls to 0.5 children per woman lower than the medium
variant, or 5.8 per cent if total fertility declines less rapidly, to a level that is 0.5 children per
woman higher than in the medium variant. Higher fertility in Nigeria is also associated with
greater uncertainty in projected future fertility. Both the high- and low-fertility scenarios fall
well within the 80 per cent prediction interval associated with the probabilistic projections of
total fertility for Nigeria.


                      E. INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND POPULATION AGEING

    While declining fertility and increasing longevity are the key drivers of population ageing
globally, international migration has also contributed to changing population age structures in
some countries and regions. In countries that are experiencing large immigration flows,
international migration can slow the ageing process, at least temporarily, since migrants tend to
be in the young working ages. However, migrants who remain in the country eventually will age
into the older population. Thus, over the long term, only sustained large flows of young
immigrants could slow or reverse population ageing. A 2001 study from the United Nations
concluded that in several European countries, as well as in Japan, the Republic of Korea and the
United States, levels of immigration would need to be much higher than had been observed in
the past in order for international migration to offset population ageing, and thus, replacement
migration alone was unlikely to be an effective policy response to population ageing (United

Nations, 2001). Other studies also have concluded that the levels of international migration
required to offset population ageing are implausible (see, for example, Bijak and others, 2007).14

    Despite these conclusions, there is some evidence that countries are increasingly turning to
international migration as a means to expand the size of the labour force in the context of an
ageing population. The number of countries with policies to increase rates of immigration has
been rising steadily over time from 8 in 1996 to 11 in 2005 and to 22 in 2013. Among those
countries enacting policies to raise the level of immigration, most have identified population
ageing as a “major concern” (figure III.13). In 2013, population ageing was cited as a major
concern by 20 of the 22 countries (91 per cent) with policies to raise immigration levels. By
comparison, 47 per cent of countries that had not enacted policies to promote immigration
identified population ageing as a “major concern” (United Nations, 2014c).

    Over time, the number of countries seeking to maintain their levels of immigration also has
increased (from 104 in 2005 to 120 in 2013), while the number seeking to lower levels of
immigration has declined (from 43 in 2005 to 30 in 2013). Half of the countries with policies to
maintain levels of immigration in 2013 had identified population ageing as a major concern.

  This conclusion may soon be challenged by recent experience in Europe, where current evidence suggests that flows of migrants, refugees and
asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa are reaching historically unprecedented magnitudes (OECD, 2015a,
http://www.oecd.org/migration/Is-this-refugee-crisis-different.pdf).



62                                                                                                                                            World Population Ageing 2015


    Conversely, the emigration of young workers has accelerated the population ageing process
in some countries, particularly in Eastern Europe where increasing access to European Union
labour markets as well as the economic crisis that began in 2008 have contributed to large
emigration flows. In Lithuania, for example, net emigration over the 2000s was equivalent to 13
per cent of the population, while in Latvia and Estonia it was 9 per cent and 6 per cent,
respectively (OECD, 2013a). Young people aged 20 to 35 accounted for a disproportionate
share of emigrants from these countries (OECD, 2013a), thereby contributing to intensify
population ageing there. Between 2000 and 2015, the share of older persons in Lithuania grew
from 19 per cent to 25 per cent and in both Latvia and Estonia from 21 per cent to 25 per cent.

    Looking to the near future, international migration is projected to have only small effects on
the pace of population ageing in most countries. The magnitude of the impact of international
migration on projected trends in population ageing can be understood through a comparison of
the projected proportion of the population aged 60 years or over in 2030 according to the
“medium variant” to the projected proportion aged 60 years or over according to a “zero
migration” scenario. The medium variant reflects median projected future levels of fertility and
mortality rates, as well as future migration levels that take into account levels and trends in
migration observed in the country during the recent past. The zero migration scenario considers
what the future population would be under the median fertility and mortality levels, but in the
absence of any international migration. In 163 out of 201 countries or areas with at least 90,000
inhabitants in 2015, the difference in the percentage aged 60 years or over in 2030 between the
medium variant and zero migration scenarios amounts to less than 1 percentage point.

     Net migration is projected to slow population ageing in 24 of the 38 countries or areas where
projected net migration implies a greater than one point difference in the percentage of the
population aged 60 years or over in 2030 (table III.5). In the remaining 14 countries, net
migration is expected to actually accelerate population ageing between 2015 and 2030 (table
III.6). Labour migration to the Gulf States of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates is projected to counter population ageing trends so that the projected percentage of the
population aged 60 years or over in 2030 is substantially lower than it would be if no migration
were to take place. In Qatar, for example, the medium variant projection indicates that 7.9 per
cent of the population will be aged 60 years or over in 2030, but it would be 11 per cent if no
migration were to take place between 2015 and 2030. In the United Arab Emirates, older
persons are projected to account for 11.3 per cent of the population in 2030 according to the
medium variant, but would account for 14.2 per cent in the absence of migration.

    Other populations that receive a large number of migrants in the working ages are also
projected to see slower population ageing as a result, including Luxembourg, Macao, Australia,
Switzerland, Canada, the Channel Islands, Hong Kong, special administrative region of China,
and Norway, where the percentage aged 60 years or over is projected to be more than 2
percentage points lower in 2030 than it would be in the absence of migration. Migration has the
largest impact on the pace of population ageing in Luxembourg: if there were no net migration to
Luxembourg the projected percentage of persons aged 60 years or over in 2030 would be 28.9
per cent instead of the 24.7 per cent projected in the medium variant.

    International migration is anticipated to accelerate population ageing in some countries, due
to projected net emigration of working aged people, net immigration of older people, or both.
Many of the populations that are projected to see ageing accelerated by migration between 2015
and 2030 are located in the Caribbean. In Barbados, for example, the proportion aged 60 years
or over in 2030 is projected to reach 27.7 per cent in the medium variant, compared to 25.4 per
cent with no migration. In Guadeloupe, the population is projected to become 30.5 per cent aged
60 years or over in 2030, compared to 29.3 per cent with no migration. Outside of the Caribbean
region, Lebanon, Samoa, Albania, Tonga, Sri Lanka and Réunion are also projected to see
population ageing accelerated as a result of international migration.

   IV. Population ageing and sustainable development
    World population ageing is a consequence, in part, of substantial progress in improving the
health and well-being and reducing mortality risks faced by people around the globe. People are
living longer, and, in many cases, healthier lives than ever before. The benefits of greater
longevity to individuals, families and society are many. Longer lives can afford individuals
opportunities to prolong their working life, embark on second careers, or pursue varied interests
in old age. Families benefit from the contributions of older generations, for example, through
financial support, assistance with household maintenance, or participation in childcare. Societies
benefit from the wisdom and experience of older persons and from their contributions to the
labour force, as well as from their volunteerism, philanthropy and civic engagement.

    At the same time, many countries are concerned about population ageing, especially with
respect to its implications for the systems and institutions that aim to protect and preserve
people’s well-being. In many countries, the number of older persons is growing faster than the
number of people in the traditional working ages, giving rise to concerns about the fiscal
sustainability of pension systems that rely upon contributions from current workers to pay
benefits to retirees. Moreover, population ageing and growth in the number of persons at very
advanced ages put pressure on health systems, which must adapt to meet the growing demand for
care, services and technologies to prevent and treat non-communicable diseases and chronic
conditions associated with old age.

    This chapter explores the implications of recent and projected trends in population ageing for
efforts towards progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In
particular, the three sections of this chapter address the challenges posed by the growth in the
number and share of older persons in the population for efforts to eradicate poverty and promote
economic growth, to ensure the sustainability of pension systems and to promote health and
well-being at all ages.


                               A. AGEING, POVERTY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

    This section draws upon the latest empirical evidence and economic literature in order to: 1)
describe the poverty status of older persons relative to the population overall; 2) analyse older
persons’ levels of consumption compared to other age groups and across countries at different
levels of national income; and 3) assess the macroeconomic implications of population ageing on
economic growth.

Poverty rates among older persons relative to the general population vary, largely due to
the coverage and adequacy of old-age social protection systems.

    Describing the poverty rates of people in different age groups is challenging for a number of
reasons. First, surveys generally measure income and consumption at the household level rather
than for individuals at different ages. Household welfare does not necessarily reflect accurately
the welfare of all individuals in the household because the household resources could be
distributed unequally across its members. Second, different definitions and approaches to


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                  67


measuring poverty present difficulties for comparisons across studies and populations. The
national poverty lines defined by countries often differ from the World Bank’s poverty threshold
of US$1.90 a day15 or from the (relative) measure of half the median national income used by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Third, discussions of age
patterns of poverty in international comparative perspective are further challenged by the
absence of an international harmonized database of poverty rates disaggregated by age. The
World Bank’s comprehensive poverty database covering all countries (PovcalNet) is not age
disaggregated. Thus, evidence on poverty rates among older persons and for other age groups is
limited to selected country-level or regional-level studies.

    Nevertheless, available data on the prevalence of poverty by age offer some useful insights
into how well older persons are faring relative to people in other age groups. The following
section reviews the existing evidence on poverty rates among older persons in relation to the
poverty rates of the population as a whole, acknowledging the differences in concepts and
measures across studies and regions.

Older persons tend to be poorer than the general population in African countries and are
more often less poor than the overall population in Latin America and Europe.

    Figure IV.1 plots, by region, the poverty rate for older persons against the poverty rate for the
total population for countries with available data. Estimates for countries in Africa, depicted in
the upper-left chart of the figure, are from a 2005 study that assessed poverty among older
persons using the national definition of the poverty line between 1998 and 2001 (Kakwani and
Subbarao, 2005). For the 18 Latin American countries depicted in the upper-right chart of the
figure, poverty estimates are from a 2011 study of the Socioeconomic Database for Latin
America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC) (Cotlear and Tornarolli, 2011), and the poverty threshold
is defined as US$2.5 per day. Estimates for countries located in Eastern and Southern Europe,
plotted in the lower-left chart, are from a World Bank study (Bussolo and others, 2015) that
defined the poverty line at US$5 per day. Estimates for selected OECD countries, depicted in the
lower-right chart of the figure, are as reported by the OECD (2015b) using the relative poverty
line definition of half the median disposable income in the country.

    The 45-degree line in each chart represents the points at which the poverty rates among older
persons are equivalent to the poverty rates for the population overall. Points that fall above the
45-degree line indicate that poverty rates among older persons exceed those of the total
population, while the points that fall below the 45-degree line indicate that poverty rates among
older persons are lower than among the total population.

Older persons in most sub-Saharan African countries are most commonly poorer than
other age groups.

    While most African countries are not far from the 45-degree line, indicating that poverty
rates among older persons were similar to those of the total population, disparities were evident
in some countries. In Zambia, for example, 80 per cent of people aged 60 years or over were

  In October 2015 the World Bank revised its definition of “extreme poverty” to living on less than $1.90 per day from $1.25 per day, reflecting
the latest updates in purchasing power parities. (http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report/poverty-forecasts-2015).

under the national poverty line, compared to around 67 per cent of the general population
overall. By comparison, in some countries in Africa, including Burundi, Madagascar,
Mozambique and Nigeria, older persons were somewhat less poor, on average, than the total
population.

    In assessing poverty rates among older persons in Africa, Kakwani and Subbarao (2005) also
found some significant rural-urban differences with a much higher proportion of single older
persons living in poverty in rural areas compared to urban areas. In addition, poverty rates were
higher for older persons in countries with high prevalence of HIV. Excess mortality among
young adults in these countries meant that many older persons lost the support that they would
have received from their adult children and they also have assumed greater responsibility for
generating income and caring for children in their extended families. Deaton and Paxson (1997)
found that the poverty rate for older persons was higher than that for younger adults in South
Africa in 1996. Some significant differences were found by gender, wherein households headed
by older women were more prone to poverty than households headed by older men, especially in
parts of sub-Saharan Africa that are patriarchal (Kakwani and Subbarao, 2005). In societies
where women lack certain rights to own or inherit property, widows face a significant risk of
poverty following the dispossession of their house and land by the deceased husband’s kin
(Toulmin, 2006).

In Latin America, poverty rates among older persons tend to be lower than for the
population as a whole.

    For the Latin American region as a whole, an estimated 19 per cent of people aged 60 years
or over were poor in the mid-2000s, with the poverty line defined as US$2.5 per day. By
comparison, 30 per cent of children under age 15, 20 per cent of young adults aged 15-24 years,
and 23 per cent of the population overall were poor (Cotlear and Tornarolli, 2011). In several
countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, where pension systems include
minimum levels of support for both contributors and non-contributors (for example, persons who
are unable to contribute due to poverty or disability), older persons were substantially better off,
on average, compared to the population as a whole. In Argentina, just 4 per cent of older persons
were poor, compared to 11 per cent of the overall population. The national poverty rate was
higher in Brazil, at close to 18 per cent, but there, too, just 4 per cent of older persons were poor.

    Pensions are generous in some countries in Latin America compared to other developing
countries, and public spending was highly skewed towards older persons. As a result, older
persons usually had higher average levels of welfare relative to children. Examples of countries
where the poverty rate among children exceeded that of older persons include Brazil, Chile and
Uruguay (Bravo and Holz, 2011; Turra and others, 2011). By contrast, social pension benefits
were lower in Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico, where older persons were slightly poorer, on
average, than the total population. In addition, the incidence of poverty in these three countries
was higher for older persons living in rural areas and for the oldest-old (aged 80 years or over)
(Cotlear and Tornarolli, 2011).

    As noted earlier, conclusions about the relative poverty of older persons are sensitive to the
choice of the poverty definition (Deaton and Paxson, 1997). Indeed, another study of Latin
American countries that used the relative poverty measure of 50 per cent of the national median
income arrived at a slightly different conclusion. Using the same SEDLAC database as Cotlear
and Tornarolli (2011), Dethier and others (2010) concluded that poverty rates were consistently
lower for older persons relative to the total population only in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
Uruguay. Using the half the median income definition of poverty, poverty rates among older

persons in Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico were found to be higher than
for the population overall.

In Eastern and Southern Europe, older persons tend to be less poor than average.

    A 2015 World Bank study of selected countries in Eastern and Southern Europe assessed the
poverty rates among older persons using a poverty definition of US$5 per day purchasing power
parity (Bussolo and others, 2015). Among the 21 countries plotted in the lower-left chart of
figure IV.1, only the Republic of Moldova lies above the 45-degree line, indicating that older
persons were, on average, somewhat poorer than the total population in that country. For all the
21 countries in Eastern and Southern Europe, the poverty rate among the older population (aged
65 years or over) was 10.7 per cent on average, compared to an average 14.5 per cent for the
total population. As many of these countries transitioned away from socialist economies, older
people were able to build up some assets while still receiving relatively generous pensions, and
thus became wealthier than other age groups (Bloom and others, 2011).

In most countries in Northern and Western Europe, poverty rates among older persons are
lower than for the overall population.

    Estimates from the OECD, shown in the lower-right chart of figure IV.1, summarize poverty
rates according to the measure of 50 per cent of median disposable income (OECD, 2015b). The
prevalence of poverty was lower for older persons (aged 65 years or over) than for the total
population in numerous countries, including Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and Portugal, among others. This is explained by the current generation of older
persons having benefitted from long and significant contributions to private or public social
security systems, as well as their private asset accumulation. However, the incidence of poverty
was higher, on average, for older persons relative to the general population in Australia, Austria,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Some factors contributing to
the higher relative poverty rates among older persons in these countries included the high costs
of health care, modest public pensions and relatively high earnings among younger working-age
adults.

In Asian countries, poverty rates among older persons are often similar to or slightly
higher than those for other age groups.

    Data on poverty rates by age group are more limited in Asia than in other developing regions.
Evidence from China and Indonesia suggests that poverty rates are somewhat higher for older
persons than for others. In China, home to nearly a quarter of the world’s older population, a
World Bank report (2009) showed that nearly 13 per cent of Chinese older persons had incomes
below the US$1 per day per capita consumption poverty line in 2003, compared to 12 per cent of
the working-age population (defined in this study as ages 16-60 years) and 17 per cent of
children (younger than 16 years). The welfare of older persons in China varied considerably
according to living arrangement, health status and location. Older persons who lived alone, in
rural areas, with poor health status, without pensions, or who were illiterate, were more likely to
be poor (Park and others, 2012). However, a separate study that assessed poverty by measuring
consumption at the individual level rather than at the household level found that Chinese older



United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                   71


persons who lived with grandchildren, without adult children or who lived in multi-generational
households with young children fared worse than those who lived alone (Tung and Lai, 2011).
Older persons living in these households tended to have lower levels of consumption as some of
the family resources, either from the working-age adults or the older persons themselves, were
diverted to the young dependents. Population ageing is occurring rapidly in China due to the
precipitous decline in fertility that began in the 1970’s. In response to population ageing and a
growing concern that the future older population in China will have few children on whom to
rely for support, the Chinese government has recently lifted its one-child policy (Zhao, 2015).

    In Indonesia, older persons were also found to be slightly poorer, on average, than younger
people in 2012 (Priebe and Howell, 2014). Measured by the national consumption poverty line,
an estimated 13 per cent of older persons in Indonesia were considered to be poor, compared to
12 per cent of people in other age groups. An estimated 2.5 million older persons lived in
poverty in Indonesia, where the formal pension system covered only a minority of older persons.

    Conversely, evidence for India indicates that the poverty rate of older persons is lower than
that of other age groups. In India, home to 13 per cent of the world’s older population,
households with older persons were not found to be poorer than households without an older
person (Pal and Palacios, 2008; Srivastava and Mohanty, 2012). An estimated 18 million older
persons (approximately one in five older persons) lived below the national consumption poverty
line in 2004 in India (Srivastava and Mohanty, 2012).

Data on age patterns of consumption document the relative welfare of older persons in the
population.

    Although the level of consumption is not equivalent to welfare, consumption is a major
determinant of welfare and therefore garners attention from both researchers and policymakers.
In particular, the “lifecycle hypothesis” of consumption and saving proposes that individuals
tend to smooth their consumption over time in order to maximize their lifetime welfare. To
accomplish that, people may borrow against their future earnings when young, save during their
working years and consume accumulated assets during retirement. Because data typically are
collected at the household level, empirical research on the consumption of individuals at
different ages is not straightforward. The National Transfer Accounts (NTA) project has
addressed this issue by developing a consistent conceptual and accounting framework, as well as
standardized estimation methods that have yielded a harmonized database of production,
consumption and inter-age reallocations for 36 countries, representing all regions of the world.16
NTA methods allocate household consumption to individuals using a combination of regression
methods for age-specific consumption on education and health care expenditures, as well as
weights for other types of consumption. Both private and public consumption are taken into
account. Details of the methodology can be found in the National Transfer Accounts Manual
(United Nations, 2013). Selected findings on the levels of consumption among older persons are
highlighted below.

Older persons in middle-income countries often consume less than working-age adults,
whereas in high-income countries, older persons tend to consume more than working-age
adults, on average.

    Figure IV.2 shows the average consumption age profiles for countries of three broad income
groups. To facilitate comparisons, the average level of consumption at each age is compared to
the average level of consumption of persons aged 30-49 years, which are often considered the
prime working ages. In all income groups, consumption increases steadily from childhood to
adulthood. Relative consumption patterns at older ages display two distinctive patterns. The first
is characterized by levels of consumption that decline gradually or stay constant with age relative
to the consumption of other adults, as, for example, in some middle-income countries such as
India, the Philippines and Thailand. Other middle-income countries like Indonesia and Mexico
experienced a slight decline in the level of consumption at older ages; that is to say, older
persons consume slightly less than other adults in these countries. A second general age pattern
is that of consumption levels that increase at the older ages. This pattern is observed mainly in
high-income countries such as Germany, Japan, Sweden and the United States. In some high-
income countries, the consumption of older people exceeds that of younger adults by 30 per cent
or more.

Public spending, especially on health, plays an important redistributive role and provides
significant support to consumption in old-age, especially in high-income countries.

    Figure IV.3 shows the public and private sector components of older persons’ consumption
in countries grouped according to the level of national income. Two major differences are found
between countries of different income groups. First, the health component of older persons’
consumption increases with the level of national income. High-income countries spent a quarter
of older persons’ total consumption on health, while health consumption represents only around
10 per cent of older persons’ consumption in lower-middle-income countries and low-income
countries. Second, the role of the public sector in financing older persons’ consumption increases
with the level of national income. In high-income countries, the public sector finances a large
majority of older persons’ health consumption, while in low-income and lower-middle-income
countries, public spending on health for older people is marginal; the lion’s share of health
consumption is paid as out-of-pocket expenditures.

    Figure IV.4 shows a positive correlation between older persons’ consumption (relative to that
of adults aged 30-49 years) and the share of older persons’ consumption that is financed by the
public sector. Older persons tend to fare less well in countries where the public sector finances a
small share of their consumption. In many low-income and lower-middle-income countries, less
than 15 per cent of older persons’ consumption is supported by the public sector, and their
consumption tends to be lower than that of adults aged 30-49 years. Examples include Indonesia,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal and Viet Nam. The welfare of older persons is relatively higher

in countries where public transfers finance a larger share of old-age consumption, as in Germany,
Japan, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The association
between public financing and older persons’ welfare underscores the need for improved social
protection for older persons, especially for health-care services in low-income and lower-middle-
income countries.

Population ageing need not impede economic growth.

    Demographic and macroeconomic trends in Eastern Asia during the second half of the
twentieth century demonstrated the powerful potential of changing age structures for accelerating
economic growth. Sustained fertility declines in many countries in the region led to: 1) an
increasing share of the working-age population, which helped to boost economic production; and
2) a sharp decline share of dependent children, which freed up resources for investment in
economic development and family welfare. In the language of the economic support ratio
discussed in section II.D, each equivalent consumer was supported by more equivalent workers
in Eastern Asia, which led to higher per capita income and faster economic growth. This
accelerated economic growth, directly associated with the changing age structure brought on by a
sustained drop in the fertility level, is known as the “first demographic dividend.”

    As the large working-age cohorts that produced the demographic dividend in past decades
grow older, and as continued low fertility puts downward pressure on the future growth of the
labour force, the effect on per capita income growth will be reduced and could eventually turn
negative.

    Figure IV.5 illustrates how China’s economic support ratio,17 the effective number of
workers divided by the effective number of consumers in the population, has changed since
1950, producing the first demographic dividend in the country since the 1970s. Although China’s
fertility decline began in the 1950s, it accelerated in the 1970s when the labour force increased as
a share of the total population and the economic support ratio started to pick up, yielding a boost
in economic growth of nearly 0.7 per cent per year during 1970-2015. As the population of
China continues to age, the economic support ratio is expected to decline from its current peak,
and the effect of changing age structures is expected to turn slightly negative in the coming
decades.

A second demographic dividend could fuel economic growth as populations age if societies
encourage savings and invest in human and physical capital early on.

    Although population ageing poses these and other economic challenges, two recent studies
concluded that ageing need not impede economic growth, and, in fact, could support continued
economic growth under certain conditions. Lee and Mason (2010) proposed that an additional
contribution to economic growth beyond the period of the first dividend, termed the “second
demographic dividend,” could be generated when low fertility and rising longevity lead to an
increase in human capital and physical investment, which in turn raises labour productivity and

income per capita. Based on an analysis of cross-country data, the authors present evidence that
lower fertility is strongly associated with rising rates of investment in human capital per child,18
which raises labour productivity and economic growth. Their analysis is also consistent with the
notion that individuals, as they anticipate increasing longevity, are motivated to accumulate
assets for their old age (Tobin, 1973).19 The second demographic dividend can persist over a
much longer period of time than the first dividend, and is more likely to be more significant in
societies that rely not only on public or familial transfers to finance older persons’ consumption,
but that also promote personal savings for retirement and old age.

    A second study postulates that societies will initiate behavioural changes and policy
responses to countervail the negative economic effects of population ageing (Bloom and others,
2014). For example, the increasing share of older dependents could be offset, partially or
completely, in some cases, by a decrease in dependent children due to fertility decline. The
eventual contraction of the share of working-age population could be mitigated by rising female
labour force participation and delayed retirement ages. Furthermore, the labour market could
adjust by enabling more labour-saving technology that can increase productivity per worker. As
noted earlier, as people expect to live longer, many may increase their savings in anticipation of
long periods of retirement. Finally, the coming cohorts of older persons have benefitted from
higher levels of education, income and wealth relative to today’s older population, and are
therefore more likely to be able to support themselves during old age.


                                        B. POPULATION AGEING AND SOCIAL PROTECTION

    Older persons vary greatly in regard to their independence and economic self-sufficiency.
Many older persons live independently and support themselves with their own income and
savings while helping others, including some that remain active in the labour force. But for large
segments of the population, old age is associated with increasing dependency and vulnerability
associated with declining income or health and a growing need for care and support. Older
people’s vulnerability is greater where there is no reliable source of income support, such as
through social protection mechanisms, which may take the form of pensions, disability insurance
or health care benefits for older persons.

    Retirement pensions or similar schemes involving income support at older ages are critical to
older persons’ social protection. The right to income security in old age is grounded in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights (1966). More recently, social protection, including the need to ensure
social protection floors that establish a minimum standard of living, was reflected in the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. In recent decades, many low-income and middle-income
countries have expanded the coverage of contributory pension schemes and established non-
contributory social pensions. Many high-income countries have undertaken fiscal consolidation,
reforming their pension systems by raising the statutory pensionable age, reducing benefits or
increasing contribution rates to ensure the system’s long-term sustainability.

  If these assets are invested domestically, then physical capital per worker and aggregate production will grow. If invested abroad, then net
foreign income will increase and so will national income.

    This section describes the global situation with respect to the social protection of older
persons by examining the interrelated domains of the labour force participation of older persons
and the statutory retirement ages for older men and women, which influence older persons’
levels of income, and, in turn, their need for social protection. Next, this section discusses the
pension coverage and pension replacement rates that describe older persons’ access to social
protection, as well as the adequacy of existing schemes.


Box 1.
Types of old-age pension schemes


 Contributory pension schemes protect persons who have made contributions during a qualifying period.
 Contributory schemes cover mostly workers on formal wage-employment and, in some countries, the self-
 employed.

 Non-contributory pension schemes do not require specific contribution from beneficiaries or their
 employers. These schemes are usually financed through general taxes or other state revenues. Non-
 contributory benefits play a key role in providing at least a minimum level of income security for older people,
 especially for those who, for any reason, do not contribute to social insurance for long enough to be eligible
 for benefits. Non-contributory schemes can be:

          (a) Universal, providing benefits to all people above the age of eligibility who meet
              criteria of residency and/or citizenship;

          (b) Means-tested schemes, provide benefits upon proof of need and target older persons
              whose total income (including contributory pensions, if any) fall below a certain
              threshold.




In 2015, more than 30 per cent of older men and more than 14 per cent of older women
were active in the labour force. Older people in developing regions were more likely to be
economically active than their peers in the developed regions.

    The labour force participation rate is defined as the share of the working-age population that
is active in the labour market, either employed or seeking employment. According to estimates
from the International Labour Organization (ILO), the labour force participation rate of persons
aged 65 years or over globally was 30.3 per cent for men and 14.5 per cent for women in 2015.
In the more developed regions, 16.8 per cent of older men and 9.4 per cent of older women were
in the labour force compared to 37.3 per cent of older men and 17.5 per cent of older women in
the less developed regions. In the least developed countries, 59.1 per cent of older men and 34.5
per cent of older women participated in the labour force in 2015.

    Labour force participation among older men was highest in Africa (52.2 per cent), followed
by Latin America and the Caribbean (38.1 per cent), Asia (34.8 per cent), Northern America
(23.5 per cent), Oceania (21.4 per cent) and Europe (10.2 per cent). The labour force
participation of older women was lower than that of older men in all regions, but followed a
similar pattern across regions, with Africa having the highest participation rate (32.6 per cent of

women aged 65 years or over were active in the labour force), followed by Latin America and
the Caribbean (16.8 per cent), Asia (15.6 per cent), Northern America (14.5 per cent), Oceania
(11.8 per cent) and Europe (6.2 per cent).

    Figure IV.6 maps the labour force participation rate of older men and women by country in
2015. In 52 countries, more than 50 per cent of older men aged 65 years or over were active in
the labour market. Most of these countries were located in Africa, Latin America and the
Caribbean or Asia. A number of countries in Africa had the highest levels of labour force
participation of older men in the world. Labour force participation was highest for older men in
Malawi (94 per cent), followed by Mozambique (85.4 per cent) and Gambia (84.2 per cent). In
Latin America and the Caribbean, Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras, Peru and Ecuador each had more
than 50 per cent of older men active in the labour force. Despite the existence of a universal
pension system in Bolivia, almost two thirds of older men participated in the labour force there.
Older men’s labour force participation was below 10 per cent in 28 countries, most of which
were located in Europe.

    Older women’s labour force participation exceeded 50 per cent in only 15 countries, mostly
located in Africa. As for older men, Malawi had the highest labour force participation rate for
older women (86.1 per cent). Malawi was followed by Mozambique (76.1 per cent) and Zambia
(68 per cent). Older women’s labour force participation was below 10 per cent in 87 countries.
All countries in Europe except Iceland, Estonia, Romania and Ukraine were among those where
fewer than 10 per cent of women aged 65 years or over were active in the labour force in 2015.

In Europe, Oceania and Northern America, the labour force participation of older men has
increased gradually since 1990. In contrast, the labour force participation of older men has
declined steadily in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa. Labour force
participation of older women has increased since 1990 in all regions.

    Figure IV.7 shows the changes over time in older men’s and women’s labour force
participation, by region. The labour force participation of men aged 65 years or over gradually
increased from 1990 to 2015. In contrast, the labour force participation of older men is declining
steadily in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa. Older women’s labour force
participation increased in all regions between 1990 and 2015. These trends for older women are
driven primarily by the overall increases in female labour force participation, with each
successive cohort of women reaching age 65 tending to have higher rates of attachment to the
labour market relative to earlier cohorts.

    The availability of pensions is an important factor associated with the labour force
participation of older persons. After a period of steady decline, the labour force participation of
men has increased recently in most high-income OECD countries, mostly due to policies that
have increased the statutory retirement ages, restricted access to early retirement options or made
early retirement less attractive financially. Labour force participation rates of older women in
OECD countries have increased steadily over the past twenty-five years, reflecting both broader
societal trends in women’s labour force participation, as well as pension system reforms that
encourage them to continue working until older ages (European Commission, 2014; Leonesio
and others, 2012). In contrast, the very high participation rates of older people in most low-

income and middle-income countries are an expression of need, given the low pension coverage
and modest benefits for those who are covered.

    Since most older persons in low-income and many middle-income countries have worked in
the informal economy or in rural areas, they generally have not contributed to pension schemes
during their working life and are thus not eligible to receive benefits from contributory pension
systems. Non-contributory social assistance or universal pensions are not available in all
countries, leaving many adults little choice but to continue working into their old-age.

Statutory retirement ages are increasing in most countries in the world.

    Typically, pension benefits become payable between the ages of 60 and 65 years, although in
some countries, workers become eligible for length-of-service benefits payable after they
complete 30 to 40 years of work or contributions. Another type of eligibility requirement for
retirement pensions is total or substantial withdrawal from the labour force. Many programmes
offer optional settlements or early retirement benefits before the statutory retirement age is
reached. A reduced (early) pension, in many instances, may be claimed up to five years before
the statutory retirement age. Some countries also allow for lower retirement ages for some
specific occupations considered unhealthy or hazardous, such as underground mining (United
States Social Security Administration, 2014).

    Europe is the world’s major region with the most aged population, yet the average statutory
retirement age for men in Europe was lower than for men in Northern America, which has a
younger population. Information available for 41 European countries in 2014 indicate that the
statutory retirement age for males exceeded 65 years only in Iceland, Norway and Italy. It was
exactly 65 years in 22 countries, and it was between 60 and 64 years in 16 countries. The
statutory retirement age for men was 65 years or more in Canada and the United States of
America. From 2006 to 2014, many countries in Europe and in Northern America increased
gradually the statutory age of retirement (figure IV.8). For example, in the United States of
America, the age of retirement with full benefits increased from 65 years to 66 years for people
born in 1943-1954, and policies indicated that it would rise to 67 years for those born in 1960 or
later.

    The statutory retirement ages for men in Latin America and the Caribbean were generally
higher than those for men in Africa, Asia and Oceania. The statutory retirement age for men was
lowest in Oceania on average, where it was equal to or lower than 55 years in more than half of
the 11 countries. Between 2006 and 2014, Micronesia raised the age of retirement from 60 to 65
years, while Australia had plans to raise it gradually beginning in 2017 to reach 67 years in 2023.

    In Latin America and the Caribbean, the retirement age for men was between 60 and 64 years
in a majority (53 per cent) of the 31 countries with available data in 2014. In the remaining
countries, the retirement age was 65 years, with the exceptions of Bolivia and Haiti, where the
retirement age was 58 years. Between 2006 and 2014, while some countries such as Cuba and
Dominica raised the age of retirement from 60 years to 65 years,20 Bolivia lowered the age of
retirement from 65 years to 58 years in 2010.

  Cuba gradually raised the age of retirement to 65 years by 2015. Dominica planned to increase the statutory retirement age incrementally—by
six months every year—until the year 2021, when the pensionable age would be set at age 65.

    In Africa and Asia, the retirement age for men was between 60 and 64 years in a majority of
the countries. However, about 23 per cent of the countries in Africa had a retirement age for men
lower than 60 years in 2014. Between 2006 and 2014, 7 countries in Africa increased the
retirement age from 55 to 60 years (Benin, Chad, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique, Togo and
the United Republic of Tanzania), and one country in Africa (Mauritius) raised the retirement
age from 60 to 62.5 years. In contrast, South Africa reduced the retirement age for men from 65
years to 60 years.

    In general, the statutory age of retirement for women was the same as or lower (often by five
years) than the retirement age for men. In 2014, the age of retirement for women was lower than
that for men in 61 out of 167 countries with data available. Among developing countries,
younger retirement ages for women were most prevalent in Asia (the retirement age for women
was below 60 years in 66 per cent of countries), followed by Oceania (55 per cent of countries),
and Africa (37 per cent of countries) (figure IV.8). Statutory retirement ages for women in Latin
America and the Caribbean were often higher than those in other developing regions: roughly 88
per cent of countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region had female retirement ages
between 60 and 64 years. In Europe, the female retirement age was between 60 and 64 years in
20 countries, it was exactly 65 years in 13 countries, and it was above 65 years only in Iceland
and Norway. The statutory retirement age for women was 65 years or more in Canada and the
United States of America. Between 2006 and 2014, many countries increased the age of
retirement for women in efforts to prolong their labour force participation and improve the
financial sustainability of pension systems.

At the global level, nearly half of all people over pensionable age do not receive a pension.21

    Most developed countries have set up mandatory pension plans, either public or private, that
together achieve quasi-universal coverage. According to ILO (2014) estimates, pension coverage
ratios in Europe and in North America were higher than 90 per cent in 2013-2014. In the less
developed regions, however, old-age pensions covered only a fraction of older persons. In
Africa, nearly 22 per cent of older persons received a pension. Pension coverage for older
persons was almost 30 per cent in the Middle East, nearly 37 per cent in North Africa, 47 per
cent in Asia and the Pacific, and 56 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean (ILO, 2014).

    Many developing countries face severe limitations to providing income security for older
persons due to the low coverage of formal pension systems. In the last decade, many low-income
and middle-income countries have extended coverage through non-contributory pension
schemes, while others have expanded contributory schemes to previously uncovered groups of
the population. Non-contributory schemes can be either universal (providing benefits to
everyone) or targeted (providing benefits to those in a particular situation of need). For instance,
China has achieved nearly universal pension coverage by complementing social insurance with
social pensions in rural areas. Other countries like Bolivia provided tax-financed universal
benefits to all older persons. Chile introduced a new programme that provided means-tested
benefits to older persons who received a low pension or no benefit at all. Most Latin American
countries, with exceptions of Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua, have expanded their pension

21
   The ILO estimates the extent of legal coverage for old-age as percentage of the older persons above statutory pensionable age who receive
periodic cash benefits (old-age pension). Pension coverage is the total coverage, including contributory mandatory, contributory voluntary and
non-contributory pension coverage.

systems or established non-contributory pensions or cash transfer programmes targeted to older
persons.

    Pension coverage is typically less extensive among women than among men owing to their
lower rates of participation in the labour market, their over-representation in the informal sector,
in self-employed or unpaid family work. (ILO, 2014a; ILO, 2014b). In many countries, the
survivor’s benefits paid through a husband’s contributory pension benefits are the sole source of
income for older women.

    Figure IV.9 illustrates the ratio of the projected population aged 60 years or over in 2030 to
the estimated population aged 60 years or over in 2015 by the level of pension coverage in 2010.
Many of the countries that are projected to see substantial growth in the size of the older
population also had low rates of pension coverage among older persons. In Iran, for example, the
number of people aged 60 years or over is expected to double between 2015 and 2030, and less
than 30 per cent of those of statutory age were receiving a pension in 2010. The population of
older persons is projected to increase by 84 per cent in Indonesia, while less than 10 per cent of
those of statutory age received a pension.

    Notably, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the projected increases in the size of the
older population at all levels of pension coverage (United Nations, 2015b). For example, the
projected increase in the number of older persons in Brazil, at 76 per cent, is nearly three times


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                                        85


that in Italy, at 26 per cent, both countries where more than 80 per cent of persons of statutory
age were covered by pensions. At middle levels of pension coverage, between 40 and 50 per
cent, growth rates of the older population are similarly diverse. In Serbia, for example, the
population aged 60 years or over is projected to increase by 4 per cent over the next 15 years,
compared to a near doubling of the numbers of older persons in Jordan and in Libya. Despite the
heterogeneity observed across countries, an overwhelming majority (78 per cent) of the countries
with pension coverage of less than 80 per cent are anticipating substantial growth of the older
population, with increases of more than 50 per cent projected between 2015 and 2030. Examples
include Mexico and Colombia, where 25 and 23 per cent, respectively, of those of statutory age
received a pension in 2010. The numbers of older persons in both countries is projected to grow
by more than 80 per cent by 2030. In both Papua New Guinea and Pakistan, less than 5 per cent
received a pension in 2010 and the population aged 60 years or over is projected to grow by 73
per cent and 66 per cent, respectively.

    As a result of continued reductions in fertility and improvements in life expectancy,
population ageing brings challenges for pension systems; affecting both pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
financed public pensions and funded pensions. Pay-as-you-go pension schemes face problems of
financial sustainability as the proportion of people in the working-ages shrinks and the
proportion of people reaching retirement age increase, while the number of years spent in
retirement is also on the rise. Trends in the potential support ratio, defined as the number of
people in the working ages (20-64 years) per person aged 65 years or over, illustrate the
demographic pressure faced by PAYG pension schemes, in particular. Figure IV.10 shows the
potential support ratios in 2015 and projected for 2030 and 2050, by region. In 2015, there were
7 working-aged people for each older person in the world. By 2050, the global potential support
ratio is projected to fall to 3.5 and all regions except Africa are expected to have potential
support ratios of 3.2 or lower. In 2050, projections indicate that there will be 2.4 working-aged
people for every older person aged 65 years or over in Northern America, 1.9 in Europe, and that
the potential support ratio will fall below 2 working-aged people for every older person aged 65
years or over in 46 countries or areas, such as Japan (1.3), Portugal (1.4), Cuba (1.5) and Austria
(1.7).

Pension replacement rates, together with ageing and population coverage rates, affect
aggregate spending in pensions.

    The gross pension replacement rate is an indicator of how effectively a pension system
provides a retirement income to replace labour earnings, the main source of income before
retirement for most people (OECD, 2015).22 The average gross replacement rate among OECD
countries was 53 per cent, with substantial cross-country variation ranging from nearly 30 per
cent in the United Kingdom to approximately 90 per cent in the Netherlands. Among the OECD
countries, workers with average earnings in Canada, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, the
United States of America and the Republic of Korea had gross replacement rates of less than 40
per cent. Among Latin American and Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and

   The gross replacement rate is defined as gross pension entitlement divided by gross pre-retirement earnings. For more details, see OECD
(2016).

    In general, the variation in current public pension spending across countries reflected mainly
differences in: 1) potential support ratios; and 2) the generosity of benefits and coverage rates
(IMF, 2011). Figure IV.11 illustrates the variation in public pension expenditures as a percentage
of gross domestic product (GDP) according to the potential support ratio and the replacement
rate for selected countries. Marker (“bubble”) sizes are proportional to the pension replacement
rate. Among countries in Europe, there was substantial variation in public spending on pensions,
ranging from less than 5 per cent of GDP in Iceland and Ireland to more than 12 per cent of GDP
in Austria, France, Greece, Italy and Portugal. Japan had the lowest potential support ratio in the
world in 2015, with 2.1 working-age people per person aged 65 years or over, but the level of
public pension expenditure in Japan was lower than in Italy (10.2 per cent versus 15.8 per cent),
due primarily to the lower pension replacement rate in Japan than in Italy (35.1 per cent versus
69.5 per cent, respectively).

    Among the Latin American and Caribbean countries, pension spending varied among
countries ranging from less than 1 per cent of GDP in Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica and Guyana to
7.9 per cent in Argentina and 8.2 per cent in Uruguay. The relatively low spending in Latin
American and Caribbean countries reflected a combination of relatively low pension coverage
(generally limited to those in the formal sector) and relatively younger populations. The average
gross replacement ratio in the 26 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean was 62 per cent,
with significant cross-country variation (OECD, 2014). Paraguay provided pension earnings that

  Data are available for OECD countries, as well as for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region, and for China, India, South Africa

exceeded working earnings (104 per cent), but just 38 per cent were receiving a pension. By
comparison, the Dominican Republic and Mexico had replacement rates of 23 per cent and 30
per cent, respectively. In some Latin American and Caribbean countries, gross replacement rates
for women were lower than those for men, due to fewer years of contribution and lower pension
eligibility ages for women. In Chile, the gross pension replacement rate for women was 10 to 13
percentage points lower than for men. Other countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El
Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Venezuela also had lower replacement rates for women than
for men, but the gender gaps were narrower than in Chile (OECD, IDB and World Bank, 2014).

        Note: The size of the bubble is proportional to the gross pension replacement rate in each country.


    In general, countries with relatively low pension coverage rates had higher labour force
participation rates among people aged 65 years and over. In Mozambique, for example, the
pension coverage rate was only 3.7 per cent and 75 per cent of those aged 65 years or over were
economically active. In Madagascar, pension coverage was 11.4 per cent and 72 per cent of older
persons were active in 2015. Furthermore, some countries with low pension replacement rates
had higher labour force participation rates among older people, despite having high coverage
rates. In Japan, for example, despite a 100 per cent pension coverage rate, the labour force
participation rate for men aged 65 years or over was considerably higher (29.4 per cent) than in
other OECD countries, partly due to the low pension replacement rate.

Recognizing the challenges posed by population ageing, many countries are pursuing
pension system reforms.

    In recent years, many governments have addressed concerns about the adequacy or
sustainability of their pension systems by modifying the parameters of those programmes. These
measures included: increases in statutory retirement ages; increases in contribution rates for
defined benefit schemes, taxes or social security contributions on pension income, as well as
minimum contributory periods; elimination of incentives for early retirement; and the
introduction of automatic adjustment mechanisms such as by linking the age at which retirement
benefits can begin to changes in life expectancy. Governments also have introduced reforms to
strengthen funded private pensions and improve their complementary role in ensuring the
adequacy of retirement income.

More than half of governments instituted retirement or pension system reforms between
2008 and 2013.

    Information about changes in statutory retirement ages and major reforms to pension systems
over the period 2008-2013 was available for 189 countries (United Nations, 2013). Of these, the
governments of 61 countries (32 per cent) changed their statutory retirement age between 2008
and 2013 and governments of 89 countries (47 per cent) reformed their pension system during
that period. Forty-seven of the 189 governments (25 per cent) changed both the retirement age
and reformed their pension systems during this time. A little less than half (46 per cent) of the
governments neither changed their statutory retirement ages nor reformed their pension system
over 2008-2013.

     Most of the OECD countries passed legislation that raised the statutory retirement age or
equalized the statutory retirement age for women and men. For example, Slovenia enacted a
reform in January 2013 that gradually increased women’s statutory retirement age to 65 years by
2016, when it will be the same as men’s. Australian women’s statutory retirement age rose to 65
years in July 2013 and the policy indicated that it would again rise—to 67 years—for both men
and women by 2023. Poland increased the statutory retirement age to 67 years for both sexes,
although on different timelines: retirement at 67 years would be effective for men in 2020, but
only by 2040 for women. In a number of countries, the age of retirement would increase
gradually, to 67 years or higher. In Canada, for instance, the normal retirement age to be eligible
for the basic pension (Old-age security) benefit would increase gradually from 65 to 67 years
between 2023 and 2029. In Ireland, the pension age increased from 65 to 66 years in 2014 and
would increase further to 67 years by 2021 and 68 years after 2028. In the Netherlands, the
retirement age would reach 66 years by 2019 and 67 years by 2023 (OECD, 2014).

    Some countries introduced policies to increase minimum contribution periods while others
restricted access to early retirement. In France, the minimum contributory periods would increase
from 41.5 years to 43 years in 2030. In Austria, the required insurance period for individuals to
be eligible for early retirement (Korridorpension) would increase from 38 years in 2013 to 40
years in 2017. In Belgium, the age for early retirement benefit eligibility increased to 60.5 years
in 2013, and the contribution period to 38 years. These parameters would increase further in
Belgium to age 62 and 40 years of contributions in 2016 (OECD, 2014).

    Although measures to increase statutory retirement ages as well as other reforms to pension
systems could improve the sustainability of pension programmes, it is important to also keep in
mind the potential impact of such broad reforms on poverty and inequality among older persons.
Both the prevalence of disability and the physical demands associated with employment can vary
considerably across socioeconomic groups, with disparate implications of continued labour force
participation at older ages. Moreover, there are significant differences in life expectancy by
socioeconomic status. Raising the statutory ages by a fixed amount is disadvantageous for groups
whose shorter average lifespans imply fewer years to collect pension benefits.


                                C. POPULATION AGEING AND HEALTH

    Across studies of population health, age nearly always stands out as the single most powerful
predictor of the state of people’s health and the prevailing risks of morbidity and mortality they
face. The specific mechanisms that link age to health status are many and complex (WHO,
2015). At the biological level, ageing is associated with accumulated damage to cells that, over
time, weakens the immune system, diminishes the body’s capacity to repair itself and increases
the risk of developing a host of different diseases (Steves and others, 2012; Vasto and others,
2010; Beard and Bloom, 2015). A person’s age also reflects the amount of time he or she may
have been exposed to various external health risks whose effects accumulate over time, such as
tobacco use or unhealthy diet. Moreover, the social changes that often take place as people enter
advanced ages, such as shifts in social roles and the loss of close relationships, may pose
additional threats to older persons’ health and well-being (WHO, 2015).

    However, while age is an important predictor of the average health risks people face, there is
a huge degree of diversity in the health status of people at any given age, reflecting random
variation across individuals, as well as differences in the life course, environment and behaviours
that shape health risks. This is especially true at older ages when the risks of specific morbidities
and mortality vary widely across individuals of the same age. That variability is associated with
numerous other predictors of health status, including, inter alia, genetic factors, which are
estimated to account for roughly a quarter of the differences in health and function observed at
older ages (Brooks-Wilson, 2013), as well as individual characteristics such as occupation, level
of income or educational attainment; environmental factors such as pollution or accessible
infrastructure; and behaviours that pose risks to health, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity or
excessive consumption of alcohol. Thus, while one 70-year-old person may enjoy good health
that enables them to remain active in the labour force and to live without much health care
support or intervention, a peer of the same age may face multiple chronic morbidities that cause
significant disability and require frequent medical interventions or health care support resources.

    While all older persons will eventually face declining health and functioning, their specific
health trajectories may vary widely. Some older persons will experience a sudden and rapid
decline from good health to death, while for others the decline in functioning will occur
gradually over many years, and others still will experience periods of illness and disability
interspersed by periods of partial or full recovery (WHO, 2015). The substantial heterogeneity in
the health status of older persons underscores the need for health systems that are responsive to
the diversity of their experience. In addition to health systems, other sectors must respond by



90                                                                      World Population Ageing, 2015


creating the infrastructure and environments that support older persons with varying functional
capacities. This includes, for example, housing and transportation infrastructure that is accessible
and safe for older persons.

    A recent assessment by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2015) warns that health
systems around the world are falling short with respect to meeting the needs of older persons.
The report summarises the present situation:

         Current public-health approaches to population ageing have clearly been ineffective.
         The health of older people is not keeping up with increasing longevity; marked
         health inequities are apparent in the health status of older people; current health
         systems are poorly aligned to the care that older populations require even in high-
         income countries; long-term care models are both inadequate and unsustainable; and
         physical and social environments present multiple barriers and disincentives to both
         health and participation (p. 18).

    Thus changes are needed around the globe to continue to adapt health systems to serve a
growing number and proportion of older persons and to maximize health and well-being at all
ages. Importantly, WHO emphasizes that the changes needed to ensure that older persons receive
the health care they require need not imply exorbitant increases in national health budgets, even
in countries with rapidly ageing populations. The following sections describe some of the key
trends identified as central to the health care needs of older persons and their associations with
population ageing, including: 1) healthy life in the context of increasing life expectancy; 2)
population ageing and the overall burden of disability experienced in a population; and 3) the
implications of population ageing for national health care expenditures.

People lost an average nine years of healthy life due to disability in 2013.

    The health of a population at a given time is often summarized with the “healthy life
expectancy” metric, which is similar conceptually to life expectancy at birth. While life
expectancy at birth summarizes the average number of years a person would be expected to live
if exposed throughout their lives to the age-specific mortality rates of a given period, healthy life
expectancy summarizes how many of those years are expected to be lived in good health, free of
disease and disability. The World Health Organization relies upon a combination of country-
level information about the incidence and prevalence of diseases, the duration and severity of the
disabilities they cause, as well as models and assumptions, in order to estimate the average
number of years spent in good health (WHO, 2014). In 2013, the most recent year for which
WHO estimates are available, life expectancy at birth was 71 years globally and the
corresponding value of healthy life expectancy was 62 years (figure IV.12). Across the six
regions defined by the WHO for statistical reporting purposes, healthy life expectancy was
longest in the Western Pacific at 68 years, followed by Europe and the Americas both at 67
years. Healthy life expectancy was shortest in Africa at 50 years, as was life expectancy at birth
at 58 years.

   A complementary metric describes the number of potentially healthy years of life lost due to
morbidity or disability. It is calculated as the difference between healthy life expectancy and life
expectancy at birth. Thus, for the world as a whole in 2013, the life expectancy of 71 years and


United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                     91


healthy life expectancy of 62 years imply that, on average, approximately nine years of healthy
life were lost due to disability. Across the regions, as shown in figure IV.12, the average
numbers of healthy years of life lost due to disability range from 8 years in Africa and in the
Western Pacific to 10 years in the Americas.

On average, people in longer-lived populations tend to spend more years living with
disability than people in populations where the average lifespan is shorter.

    In general, the number of healthy life years lost due to disability tends to be greater in
countries with a higher life expectancy at birth compared to countries with shorter average
lifespans. The top two charts in figure IV.13 plot WHO’s estimates of the number of healthy
years of life lost against the life expectancy at birth in 2013 for females and males in 194
countries or areas. For both sexes in 2013, a comparison across countries reveals an upward
sloping relationship between the two indicators. People who lived in countries with longer
lifespans lost more healthy years of life, on average, than those living in countries with shorter
lifespans. Among women in Spain, for example, who had one of the highest life expectancies in
the world at nearly 86 years, an average of 10.4 years of healthy life were lost due to disability in
2013. Women in Somalia, who had among the world’s shortest avearge lifespans at around 56
years, lost about 8.9 years of healthy life due to disability.

   However, when one considers instead the number of healthy years lost due to disability as a
percentage of the average lifespan, an inverse association is revealed across countries: on
average, people living in countries with longer life expectancies at birth tend to spend a smaller
proportion of their lives with disability or ill-health relative to people living in countries with
shorter life expectancies overall. Thus while the average woman in Spain is expected live 12 per



92                                                                                   World Population Ageing, 2015


cent of her life span with disability, the average 8.9 years of disability for the average woman in
Somalia accounts for 16 per cent of her life span.

    Associations observed in cross section among countries do not necessarily persist in
assessments of changes over time within a given population. That is, just because the years of
healthy life lost tends to be greater among countries with higher life expectancies at birth does
not guarantee that the number of healthy life years lost will increase as longevity improves in a

given country. In fact, to date, there is very limited evidence to indicate whether, as life
expectancy increases, people are living those additional years in good health, or are instead
experiencing extended periods of disability and illness (Crimmins and others, 2011; Beard and
Bloom, 2015). One study in the United States of America found an increased prevalence of
disabilities affecting basic activities of daily living, instrumental activities and mobility among
recent cohorts of older persons aged 60 to 69 years compared to cohorts a decade earlier
(Seeman and others, 2010). The same study also detected a lower prevalence of functional
limitations among recent cohorts of persons aged 80 years or over relative to oldest-old persons a
decade earlier. Another study in Austria concluded that the healthy life expectancy for older
persons had increased between 1978 and 1998, and that the proportion of healthy life years lost
due to disability had declined over the same period, indicating that ill health was increasingly
compressed into the last years of life in that country (Doblhammer and Kytir, 2001). A WHO
study found evidence of reductions in the amount of time spent in poor health in many contexts,
but noted that conflicting conclusions could be drawn from analyses with different study designs
(Chatterji and others, 2015).

    So far, these empirical studies of the association betweeen life expectancy and the average
length of healthy life have been almost exclusively limited to high-income countries. As a result,
any meaningful understanding of how trends in healthy life expectancy relate to improvements in
longevity in most of the world is currently lacking.

     Whether the growing numbers of older persons are enjoying their added years of life in good
health is a crucial consideration for policy development (WHO, 2015). If the added years of life
expectancy are years spent in disability or ill-health, then the coming trends in population ageing
could portend substantially increased demand for health care, while also preventing families,
communities and societies from benefitting from the contributions that older persons would
otherwise be able to make if they remained in good health. In contrast, if the onset or severity of
ill-health is increasingly postponed as life expectancy increases—a phenomenon termed a
“compression of morbidity”—then the health system pressures exerted by population ageing may
be attenuated.

Growing numbers of older persons lead to greater demands for the prevention and
treatment of the non-communicable diseases associated with old age.

    Irrespective of any association between population ageing and the length of healthy life, one
thing is clear: population growth equates to an increasing number of people who require access
to health care. The prevalence of chronic illness and the disabilities they cause are strongly
associated with age. For this reason, the very rapid current and future growth in the number of
older persons foretells a surge in the demand for care aimed at the prevention and treatment of
the health conditions they face. Indeed, WHO estimates of the burdens of disability caused by
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) indicate a powerful association with the pace of growth of
the older population.

   Figure IV.14 depicts the percentage change of the population aged 60 years or over between
2000 and 2012 against the percentage change of NCD-related disability over the same period, as



94                                                                     World Population Ageing, 2015


estimated in the WHO’s 2014 update of Global Health Estimates.24 Some of the countries that
saw the largest increases in NCD-related disability between 2000 and 2012 are those that
experienced the greatest proportional growth in the population of older persons. In Lebanon, for
example, the number of people aged 60 years or over grew by 71 per cent between 2000 and
2012, while the burden of NCD-related disability increased by 54 per cent. In Kuwait, the
increases in the number of older persons (78 per cent) and overall burden of NCD-related
disability (74 per cent) were similarly rapid. In South Africa, the population aged 60 years or
over grew by 41 per cent at the same that time the burden of NCD-related disability rose by 22
per cent. The number of older persons grew more slowly in the United Kingdom between 2000
and 2012, increasing by 18 per cent, and the change in the total burden of NCD-related
disability, at 7 per cent, was comparatively small as well. In the Ukraine, the population aged 60
years or over in 2012 was 5 per cent smaller than in 2000, and the country experienced a
concomitant reduction in the burden of NCD-related disability of approximately 7 per cent.

Health Estimates.


    Despite the strong positive association observed in figure IV.14, it is evident that factors
other than the growth in the number of older persons also influence the pace of change in NCD-
related disability. Most countries fall above the 45-degree dotted line in the chart, indicating that
the older population grew faster than the burden of NCD-related disability between 2000 and
2012. In some cases, the differences were substantial. In China, for example, the population aged

24
   The burden of NCD-related disability is represented by the total years of life lost due to disability (YLDs) in a population as a result of the
group of causes classified by the WHO as non-communicable diseases.



United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ǀ Population Division                                                                       95


60 years or over grew more than twice as fast as the burden of NCD-related disability (46 per
cent versus 17 per cent). In Brazil, there were 59 per cent more older persons in 2012 than in
2000, but the burden of NCD-related disability had increased by only 22 per cent.

    While growing numbers of older persons almost certainly portends growing demand for the
prevention and care of NCDs, any association between the proportion of older persons in the
population and the burden of disability or demand for care is less direct. The WHO’s global
health estimates suggest that the share of older persons is, in fact, a poor predictor of the overall
burden of disability in a population. Figure IV.15 plots the average number of years of life lost
per capita due to disability, including all ages and all causes, against the percentage of the
population aged 60 years or over. By this measure, Hungary, Cuba and Haiti experienced the
heaviest burdens of disability. In each of these three countries, disability contributed to the loss
of approximately 0.14 years of healthy life per person, on average, in 2012. Yet, Hungary, Cuba
and Haiti are at very different stages of the population ageing process: in Hungary nearly one in
four people was aged 60 years or over in 2012, versus around one in five people in Cuba and one
in fifteen people in Haiti. Germany and South Africa were similar to each other with respect to
the overall level of disability, with approximately 0.12 years of health life lost per captia due to
disability in 2012. However, Germany, with 26 per cent of the population in 2012 aged 60 years
or over was substantially more aged than South Africa, where older persons accounted for just 7
per cent of the population. Similarly, in Japan and Bangladesh, people lost on average about
0.11 years of healthy life due to disability, despite the fact that the two countries were at very
different stages of the ageing process.

Population ageing will not necessarily imply growing burdens of disability.

    There are several plausible explanations for why ageing may not lead to greater levels of
disability in a population overall. First, countries that are more advanced in the ageing process
tend to be those with higher levels of economic development, which is associated with
improvements in health and well-being. Second, the more aged and more developed countries
are often better able to treat illnesses or to accommodate the disabilities that commonly occur in
older persons, thereby lessening the degree of functional limitations they cause. Thus while
vision impairments associated with cataracts, for example, may cause minimal limitation in a
country that offers corrective surgery or adaptations that preserve the functional capacities of
persons with poor sight, the same health condition could be profoundly disabling in contexts
where such treatments or adaptations are unavailable. Surveys of older persons’ health in sub-
Saharan Africa indicate high rates of hypertension, musculoskeletal disease, visual impairment,
functional limitations and depression, many cases of which go undiagnosed or untreated
(Aboderin and Beard, 2015). Finally, some of the health conditions that commonly afflict young
people in the comparatively youthful developing regions cause chronic disability, adding
substantially to the overall level of disability in the population. Parasitic diseases, such as
intestinal worms, are an example. They afflict hundreds of millions of mostly poor people in the
developing regions and are among the leading causes of disability worldwide (Hotez, 2008).

    Given the growth of the older population, which will occur in virtually every country in the
world over the coming decades, health systems should prepare now to address the specific health
concerns of older persons. Table IV.1 lists the 10 leading causes of disability globally among
women and men aged 60 years or over, according to WHO estimates for 2012. Topping the list
for older women were unipolar depressive disorders, followed by hearing loss, back and neck
pain, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and osteoarthritis. Among older men, hearing
loss was the leading cause of disability in 2012, followed by back and neck pain, falls, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus. Vision loss, caused by refractive errors or
cataracts, is also an important cause of disability among older persons globally.

    Addressing disability among older persons entails not only treating health conditions as they
arise, but also: 1) providing the necessary accomodations, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids and
accessible housing and transportation, to reduce the degree of functional limitations they cause;
and 2) preventing or postponing the incidence of disability-causing conditions in the first place.
A growing body of research supports the notion that much of the disability-causing chronic
disease that arises in old age is linked to exposures to risk factors early in life, or even prior to
birth. Factors like low birthweight, childhood obesity, poverty, and experiences of stress during
childhood have all been linked to the onset of chronic diseases, such as heart diseases and
diabetes in adulthood (for example, see Barker, 2004; Haas, 2008; Hayward and Gorman, 2004;
Winning and others, 2005). Taken as a whole, the literature underscores the importance of
fostering good health and habits early in life to prevent or postpone the onset of morbidity at
older ages.

Population ageing need not imply exorbitant increases in national health budgets.

    The growing number and proportion of older persons in the population understandably raises
concerns about the potential pressures the health systems will face to meet their needs. What
popualtion ageing will mean for national health care expenditures is not immediately clear
(WHO, 2015). Despite the impending increased need for care, several studies have found that
older persons use health services significantly less often than younger adults. Often, the lower
rates of health care utilization among older persons reflect inadequacies in the availability or
delivery of care, or structural barriers that prevent older persons from utilizing the care they
need, which occurs in both developed and developing countries (WHO, 2015). Some evidence
from high-income countries indicates that health expenditures per person actually fall
significantly starting around age 70 (Kingsley, 2015).

    Over the recent past, there has been a great deal of variability in the observed increases of
health care expenditures across countries with a similar pace of population ageing. Figure IV.16
plots the percentage point change in the proportion of the population aged 60 years or over
between 2000 and 2013 against the percentage increase in a country’s per capita health care
expenditures over the same period.

    If population ageing were the major driver of increases in health costs, then the largest
increases in per capita health expenditures would be observed in the countries that were ageing
the fastest. By and large, this is not the case. Instead, most of the countries that experienced
extremely rapid rises in health care expenditures since 2000, were ageing relatively slowly. Both
Mongolia and the Russian Federation, for example, experienced a more than a tenfold increase in
per capita health expenditures between 2000 and 2013, even as the share of older persons
changed by only around ½ percentage point. Conversely, per capita health care expenditures
changed relatively little among many of the countries that were ageing the fastest. In Japan, the
proportion aged 60 years or over increased by 9 percentage points between 2000 and 2013, while
per capita health expenditures grew by only 38 per cent. Health expenditures in Finland more
than doubled between 2000 and 2013, which is a comparatively small increase compared to
numerous other countries, but the pace of population ageing was one of the fastest in the world,
with the share of older persons increasing by more than 6 percentage points during that period.

     Given the loose and variable relationship between population ageing and health expenditures,
WHO cautions that to predict increases in health-care costs on the basis of population ageing is
simplistic and unlikely to lead to good policy decisions (WHO, 2015). Instead, a host of other
factors should be taken into account when evaluating short- and long-term trends in health-care
costs, such as technology-related changes, growth in personal income, and cultural norms and
attitudes surrounding end-of-life care.

                                                  D. CONCLUSIONS

Preparing for an ageing population is integral to the achievement of many of the
sustainable development goals.

    Population ageing is especially relevant for development goals related to poverty eradication,
ensuring healthy lives and promoting social protection and well-being at all ages, gender
equality, and full and productive employment and decent work for all, reducing inequalities
between and within countries, and making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient
and sustainable. As populations grow increasingly aged, it is more important than ever that
governments design innovative policies and public services specifically targeted to older persons,
including those addressing, inter alia, housing, employment, health care, infrastructure and

social protection. Such policies will be essential to the success of efforts to achieve the goals laid
out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Planning for growing numbers and proportions of older persons is essential to ensure the
sustainability of pension systems.

    In some countries, large majorities of older people are covered by existing pay-as-you go or
unfunded pension programmes, but declining old-age support ratios imply that such programmes
may struggle to maintain adequate income support into the future. In response, some countries
are pursuing pension system reforms, such as increasing the statutory ages at retirement and
encouraging private savings. In many developing countries, existing pension systems cover only
a minority of older persons. There, governments should prioritize enhancing system coverage
and taking other measures to properly finance pensions for the ever-expanding population of
retirees. Countries, where appropriate, should expand their pension systems to guarantee basic
income security in old age for all, at the same time ensuring the sustainability and solvency of
pension schemes.

Health care systems must adapt to meet the needs of growing numbers of older persons.

    In countries where health systems are already well-equipped to diagnose and treat conditions
associated with old age, public policies are needed to mitigate the upward pressure on national
health care budgets exerted by the rising costs of health care services, and the longer lifespans
and increasing numbers of older persons. In places where existing health systems are weak or ill-
equipped to address the needs of an ageing population, countries should work to expand and
evolve those systems in preparation for a growing burden of non-communicable diseases. As life
expectancies increase, it is more important than ever to enact policies that promote lifelong
health and emphasize preventive care—such as those that support good nutrition and physical
activity, and discourage tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol and drugs—to prevent or
postpone the onset of age-related disability. In addition, countries should prepare for a growing
need for long-term care, both home-based and facility-based, to ensure the well-being of those at
advanced ages.

Population ageing underscores the urgency of eliminating age-related discrimination,
promoting and protecting the rights and dignity of older persons and facilitating their full
participation in society.

    Ensuring that older persons who want to work have access to employment opportunities is a
key policy priority. Policies are needed to eliminate age barriers in the formal labour market and
promote the recruitment of and flexible employment opportunities for older workers, as well as
facilitate access to microcredit and, where applicable, provide subsidies and other incentives for
self-employment. In addition, countries should ensure that older persons are included in public
policy and decision-making processes, including by utilising information and communications
technologies to facilitate their engagement in public governance processes.

Governments should act to improve older persons’ access to public services in both urban
and rural settings.

    Governments should ensure that infrastructure and services are accessible to persons with
limited mobility, or visual, hearing and other impairments, the prevalence of which tends to
increase with age. The proliferation of technologies, such as mobile devices, offers a variety of
new channels for reaching older persons, for example, by delivering messages related to health,
security or environmental hazards via short message service (SMS). Governments should help to
bridge the digital divide by addressing differences in educational background and information
and communications technology (ICT) skills of older persons through technology training
courses, programmes and learning hubs tailored to their needs.

Recent population trends indicate that virtually every country should anticipate significant
growth in the number of older persons over the coming decades, necessitating multisectoral
policies to ensure that older persons are able to participate actively in the economic, social,
cultural and political life of their societies.

    By understanding their specific population trends, governments can assess present needs and
anticipate future needs with respect to their older population. In doing so, they can proactively
implement the policies and programmes that ensure the well-being and full socio-economic
integration of older persons while maintaining the fiscal solvency of pension and health care
systems and promoting economic growth.

DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR (DALY)

        The Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) is a measurement of the gap between
current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an
advanced age, free of disease and disability. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of
“healthy” life. It is calculated as the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature
mortality in the population and the Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) for people living with the
health condition or its consequences.

DEPENDENCY RATIO

     The total dependency ratio is the number of persons under age 20 years plus persons aged
65 years or over per one hundred persons aged 20 to 64 years. It is the sum of the child
dependency ratio and the old-age dependency ratio.

     The child dependency ratio is the number of persons 0 to 19 years per one hundred
persons aged 20 to 64 years

     The old-age dependency ratio is the number of persons aged 65 years or over per one
hundred persons aged 20 to 64 years.

GROWTH RATE

      A population’s growth rate is the increase (or decrease) in the number of persons in the
population during a certain period of time, expressed as a percentage of the population at the
beginning of the time period. The average annual growth rates for all ages as well as for
particular age groups are calculated on the assumption that growth is continuous.

LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION

      The labour force participation rate consists of the economically active population in a
particular age group as a percentage of the total population of that same age group. The active
population (or labour force) includes persons in paid or unpaid employment, members of the
armed forces (including temporary members) and the unemployed (including first-time job-
seekers.). This definition is the one adopted by the Thirteenth International Conference of
Labour Statisticians (Geneva, 1982). National definitions may differ in some cases. For
information on the differences in scope, definitions and methods of calculation used for the
various national series, see International Labour Organization, Sources and Methods: Labour
Statistics (formerly Statistical Sources and Methods), Volume 5: Total and Economically Active
Population, Employment and Unemployment (Population Censuses), available from

ECONOMIC SUPPORT RATIO

      The economic support ratio is the number of equivalent producers or workers divided by
the number of equivalent consumers in a given population.

HEALTHY LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH

     The health life expectancy at a specific age is average number of years of life spent in
good health, free of illness or disability.

HEALTHY YEARS OF LIFE LOST

     The equivalent healthy years of life lost is the average number of years spent living with
disability in a population. It is equal to the life expectancy at birth minus the healthy life
expectancy at birth.

LIFE EXPECTANCY

     Life expectancy at a specific age is the average number of additional years a person of that
age could expect to live if current mortality levels observed for ages above that age were to
continue for the rest of that person’s life. In particular, life expectancy at birth is the average
number of years a newborn would live if current age-specific mortality rates were to continue.
The life expectancy at age 60 is the average number of years a 60-year-old person would life if
current age-specific mortality rates were to continue.

MEDIAN AGE

     The median age of a population is the age that divides a population into two groups of the
same size, such that half the total population is younger than this age, and the other half older.

PENSION COVERAGE

      The potential coverage reflects the percentage of persons over the statutory pensionable
age that is receiving a pension.

POTENTIAL SUPPORT RATIO

     The potential support ratio is the number of persons aged 20 to 64 years per every person
aged 65 years or over.

SEX RATIO

     The sex ratio is calculated as the number of males per one hundred females in a
population. The sex ratio may be calculated for a total population or for a specific age group.

STATUTORY PENSIONABLE AGE

      The statutory pensionable age (or statutory retirement age) is the age at which eligible
individuals qualify to receive old-age benefits in accordance to national laws and regulations. In
addition to attainment of a specified age, receiving old-age benefits can also be conditional on
the completion of a specified period of contributions or covered employment.

TOTAL FERTILITY RATE

       The total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman would bear over the
course of her lifetime if current age-specific fertility rates remained constant throughout her
childbearing years (normally between the ages of 15 and 49 years). The current total fertility
rate is an indicator of the level of fertility at a given time.

Accurate, consistent and timely data on global trends in population age structure are critical for
assessing current and future needs with respect to population ageing and for setting policy
priorities to promote the well-being of the growing number and share of older persons in the
population. This publication summarizes the trends in population aging drawn from the latest
United Nations estimates and projections of population by age and sex of 233 countries or
areas, as published in the World Population Prospects: the 2015 Revision. The report focuses
in particular on the period from 2015 to 2030, the implementation period identified for the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development and discusses some implications of trends in the number
and share of older persons for development planning, including with respect to poverty eradi-
cation and economic growth, social protection and the health and well-being of older persons.
