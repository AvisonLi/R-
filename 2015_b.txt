     Global Population Aging:
     Facts, Challenges, Solutions & Perspectives

     David E. Bloom, David Canning & Alyssa Lubet

     Abstract: The rapid aging of populations around the world presents an unprecedented set of challenges:
     shifting disease burden, increased expenditure on health and long-term care, labor-force shortages, dissaving,
     and potential problems with old-age income security. We view longer life spans, particularly longer healthy
     life spans, as an enormous gain for human welfare. The challenges come from the fact that our current




                                                                                                                        Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/daed/article-pdf/144/2/80/1830565/daed_a_00332.pdf by guest on 08 April 2025
     institutional and social arrangements are unsuited for aging populations and shifting demographics; our
     proposed solution is therefore to change our institutions and social arrangements. The ½rst section of this
     essay provides a statistical overview of global population aging and its contributing factors. The second
     section outlines some of the major challenges associated with widespread population aging. Finally, the
     third section of the essay describes various responses to these challenges, both current and prospective, facing
     individuals, businesses, institutions, and governments.
