     global population aging:      facts, challenges, solutions & perspectives       david e. bloom, david canning & alyssa lubet       abstract: the rapid aging of populations around the world presents an unprecedented set of challenges:      shifting disease burden, increased expenditure on health and long-term care, labor-force shortages, dissaving,      and potential problems with old-age income security. we view longer life spans, particularly longer healthy      life spans, as an enormous gain for human welfare. the challenges come from the fact that our current                                                                                                                             downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/daed/article-pdf/144/2/80/1830565/daed_a_00332.pdf by guest on 08 april 2025      institutional and social arrangements are unsuited for aging populations and shifting demographics; our      proposed solution is therefore to change our institutions and social arrangements. the ½rst section of this      essay provides a statistical overview of global population aging and its contributing factors. the second      section outlines some of the major challenges associated with widespread population aging. finally, the      third section of the essay describes various responses to these challenges, both current and prospective, facing      individuals, businesses, institutions, and governments.                                                     w    e are in the midst of an unprecedented transi-      david e. bloom, a fellow of the
