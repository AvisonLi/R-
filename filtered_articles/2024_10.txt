(2015) argue that every country will experience an aging population between now and 2030. over the past six decades, the proportion of the world’s population aged 60 and over has increased only slightly, from 8 to 10 %. but over the next four decades, this group is expected to rise to 22 % of the total population, jumping from 800 million to 2 billion. as the largest developing country, china encountered a negative population increase in 2022. it implies that china’s demographic dividend is gradually fading, and that the lewis inflection point has occurred. china’s aging population over the last few decades has become more problematic, largely as a result of two forces: one is the continued and rapid decrease in fertility rate, and the other is the rise in the average remaining lifespan of the elderly due to economic and social progress. population aging has a continuous and far-reaching effect on all aspects of china’s economy and society, and its implications have received the attention of many scholars. many academics summarize the negative impacts of demographic aging in the following ways. first, seniors need more health care, which can lead to higher healthcare costs. this can place a huge burden on younger generations in terms of health care costs or lead to large government deficits. second, population aging has a double effect on the industrial structure. third, an aging population reduces the effective supply of labor and slows down labor productivity. fourth, it decreases the savings rate, with younger people saving less and elder people consuming their savings, ultimately leading to less investment. fifth, there is less enthusiasm to engage in work and resistance to reform for older people, resulting in a lack of economic dynamism (choi and shin, 2015; vogel et al., 2017; lee and shin, 2019). in addition to these issues, many scholars find that population aging can also affect food security by impacting human capital (lee and yuan, * corresponding author at: school of economics and management, nanchang university, nanchang, jiangxi, china. e-mail address: cclee6101@gmail.com (c.-c. lee). contents lists available at sciencedirect technological forecasting & social change journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/techfore https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123062 received 10 september 2023; received in revised form 24 november 2023; accepted 28 november 2023 technological forecasting & social change 199 (2024) 123062 2 2024; li and sicular, 2013). food security is a dynamic and effective balance of production, distribution, and consumption of food in a country or region to ensure that all people at all times have enough food available for their survival and health (prosekov and ivanova, 2018). global hunger and malnutrition are still on the rise today. fao statistics indicate that there are still 925 million undernourished people worldwide, which means that food insecurity and malnutrition are still widespread. food security is a national concern. the ability to ensure food security directly affects their lives, social stability, and sustainable economic development (jones et al., 2013; ashraf and javed, 2023). china’s food security has also received attention from the international community, as it has always placed food production at the foundation of its national economy. over the past few decades, the food security level of china has been continuously increasing, and the problem of subsistence has been solved. however, food security in china is still facing many challenges including the reduction of arable land, increasing pressure on resources and environment, rising labor costs, rapid urbanization, and the rigid growth trend of non-farm payrolls (wang et al., 2009; du et al., 2014; ghose, 2014). today china’s food security will also be challenged by an aging rural population. as the population increases and consumption expands, china’s per capita arable land area will further decrease, while the per capita food consumption level will further increase, so population aging will have a great impact on china’s food security. nowadays, the growing trend of an aging demographic in rural areas has caused many people to worry about food security. whether this will influence food security has raised the concern of many scholars (li et al., 2016; liu et al., 2021). scholars currently hold two main views. such an aging demographic affects the human capital and physical strength of the labor force in rural areas. one group of scholars believes that population aging will jeopardize food security by reducing the physical strength of the rural labor force, the supply of labor and the input of agricultural factors (rigg et al., 2020; liu et al., 2023). other scholars argue that older people have more agricultural labor time and experience, and that with the development of agricultural mechanization and the convergence of production decisions, the aging of the population will not have a negative impact on food production (guo et al., 2015; wang et al., 2016). in this context, many scholars have explored the factors affecting food security from multiple perspectives and explored the path to guaranteeing food security (khan et al., 2009; thou, 2010; gozgor and memis, 2015; liu and zhou, 2021; hossain et al., 2023). as big data, hardware, and algorithms advance rapidly, artificial intelligence (ai) is evolving at a rapid pace, providing new tools to safeguard food security (wu et al., 2022). artificial intelligence causes profound transformations in china’s economy and brings about great changes to society (suki et al., 2022; xu et al., 2022; hassan et al., 2023; usman et al., 2023). artificial intelligence is the scientific engineering of manufacturing intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs (lee et al., 2024; moor, 2006). over the past few years, ai has gained the attention of various major countries, which are making great efforts to develop artificial intelligence. as one example, china considers ai to be a fresh drive for economic growth. the state council in 2017 published the new generation of artificial intelligence development plan, reflecting the importance attached to ai as a technology at the national policy level. economists have been very concerned about the effects of the advances in technology on an economy, while at the same time farreaching economic and social changes can be caused by the rapid evolution of ai (lee et al., 2022a; zhao et al., 2022). in the last few decades, research on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic development is proliferating, ranging from economic growth and technological innovation to income disparity, sparking widespread interest among economists (autor, 2015; arntz et al., 2016; acemoglu and restrepo, 2017; chen et al., 2022a, 2022b; tian et al., 2023). it is clearly of great significance to study the economic and social effects of ai. with the development of the internet, big data, digital economy, internet of things (iot), and other emerging technologies, technologies related to ai are also constantly being applied to agriculture with the goal of continuously promoting the modernization and informatization of agriculture and providing new tools to secure food safety (wang et al., 2022; engås et al., 2023; liu et al., 2024). is the aging of the rural demographic really going to negatively impact china’s food security? what role does ai play in ensuring food security? this paper presents ai’s role in the process of population aging and its influence on food security, studying the causal relationships among population aging, food security, and ai. to address the above issues, this paper focuses on an empirical study using china provincial balanced panel data to investigate the effects of population aging on food security and the role played by ai in it. the main research process runs as follows. first, using a benchmark regression, we find that population aging does not hurt food security. second, we employ a range of methods to conduct robustness analysis, including instrumental variables approach, re-measurement of population aging, winsorizing the variables, and addition of control variables to improve the reliability of the underlying findings. third, we find that ai has a positive influence on population aging’s impact on food security through the moderating effect model, threshold regression model, and did model. the positive influence is heterogeneous, which is verified by the subsample regression. fig. 1 illustrates the empirical research framework of this paper to better understand the research idea herein. compared to the relevant literature, the main contributions of this research are as follows. first, most studies conclude that population aging negatively impacts food security. this paper presents a new perspective, showing that population aging does not negatively affect food security. this study conducts a rigorous empirical investigation to enrich the existing literature. second, a new instrumental variable is constructed to deal with the endogeneity of the model. this study selects the interaction term between the intensity of family planning policies and the national elderly dependency ratio in the following year as an instrumental variable, which exhibits exogeneity and a correlation. third, existing research on ai has mainly focused on economic development and labor markets with few scholars empirically targeting the impact of ai on agricultural production. this paper introduces ai into the framework of the impact of population aging on food security and discusses the heterogeneous role of ai in different regions, filling the gap in the literature. fourth, our research adds innovative indicators to measure the level of ai development in agriculture based on other works. most studies use the social fixed asset investment in the information transmission, computer services, and software industries to measure the degree of intelligence (borland and coelli, 2017). because that study targets rural areas, its approach does not accurately measure the degree of intelligence in rural areas. since the current use of ai in agriculture is mainly in industrial robots, our research obtains industrial robot density in each province at the agricultural level as a measure of the level of ai development in the agriculture industry. the rest of this article runs as follows. section 2 gives a review of the available related literature. section 3 conducts an analysis of theories. section 4 presents the research methodology including data, variables, and models. section 5 reports and provides an analysis of the empirical results. section 6 explores the role of ai in agricultural production and proposes policy recommendations based on the findings. section 7 summarizes the paper, draws relevant conclusions, and presents the limitations and prospects of the research. 2. literature review 2.1. population aging and food security there is a lot of research about the effects of demographic aging on agricultural production and food security, but the views and conclusions of different scholars are still clearly controversial and divergent. one c.-c. lee et al. technological forecasting & social change 199 (2024) 123062 3 group of scholars believes that population aging has adverse effects on agricultural production. for example, rigg et al. (2020) and liu et al. (2023) reveal that demographic aging will not just cause a shortage of agricultural labor, but will also limit agricultural capital investment. this raises agricultural land resources waste and hinders the progress of modern agriculture. ren et al. (2023) find that an aging workforce indirectly impacts land use efficiency by affecting the input of agricultural capital. many scholars argue that the aging of the agricultural labor force can negatively affect agriculture production from the perspectives of agricultural production efficiency, land use efficiency, agricultural labor input and marginal effects of input factors (li and sicular, 2013; yahya and lee, 2023). another group of scholars believes that the aging of the agricultural workforce does not negatively impact agricultural development and food production. rigg et al. (2020) find that a young farmer labor force is less efficient than an elderly farm labor force in terms of arable land use because they devote more time and energy to non-farm industries. guo et al. (2015) argue that the adverse effects of population aging come mainly from the withdrawal of older agricultural labor, as older farmers themselves are more productive than other farmers. some researchers find no obvious negative impacts from such a workforce. the reason for this is that years of experience in strategies and applying agricultural mechanization reduce the physical demands of farm production. this means that agricultural mechanization and experience can compensate for the physical disadvantages of an older workforce (qiu et al., 2021). in terms of productive agricultural services, older agricultural laborer’s do not have a significant effect on food production efficiency. conversely, agricultural productive services such as machine farming have a significant positive moderating effect (wang et al., 2016). according to tang and chen (2022), we know that although an aging agricultural workforce reduces the human capital and physical strength of the agricultural labor force, it does not negatively impact china’s food production due to the convergence of production decisions and the prevalence of outsourcing of agricultural machinery. li et al. (2022) employ a panel vector autoregressive model and find a considerable positive effect of population aging and renewable energy use on green total factor productivity in agriculture from an energy consumption perspective. in accordance with the above analysis, we find that different scholars analyze the impact of the elderly agricultural labor force on food safety from various perspectives. population aging can have complex and diverse impacts on agricultural production. to sum up, an aging rural population may affect agricultural production efficiency due to factors such as declining physical strength. however, population aging may not necessarily negatively impact food production because modern agricultural technology, production methods, and social services can compensate to a certain degree for the deficiency in physical methods of older agricultural labor. 2.2. artificial intelligence and population aging the development of ai has received attention from scholars, and its effects on economic and social development have been widely studied. many scholars believe that ai contributes to economic development in several ways, including increasing productivity, improving labor productivity, and promoting innovation (cami˜na et al., 2020; lee et al., 2022a,c; wang, 2023). in terms of the labor market, current scholarship suggests that ai has mainly negative substitution effects and positive creation effects on employment (frank et al., 2019). acemoglu and restrepo (2018b) study the relationship between ai and the workforce, finding that the substitution effect itself decreases the need for a workforce, while the productivity effects improve productivity efficiency by using cheaper capital to replace labor. this raises the need for labor in jobs that are not automatically performed. some scholars forecast that ai will have a huge impact on the labor market, replacing many jobs. qian et al. (2023) find that the direction of the impact of ai development on labor income shares depends on the relative speed of machine replacement and new tasks. machine replacement makes the wage growth rate smaller than the labor productivity growth rate, leading to a decline in the labor income share. another group of scholars is optimistic about ai’s influence on labor force employment. acemoglu and restrepo (2018a, 2018b) point out that advances in technology provide and create more employment and that industrial intelligence mitigates ai’s effect on the employment market through both new job creation and productivity effects. david (2017) examines ai’s impact on the gender wage gap and presents no significant difference in substituting ai for labor among workers of different genders. in conclusion, ai enhances productivity, complements fig. 1. research framework. c.-c. lee et al. technological forecasting & social change 199 (2024) 123062 4 the workforce, but it also has a substitution effect on it. artificial intelligence has important and complex implications for economic and social development. as population aging gradually becomes the development trend of society, can ai alleviate the economic and social problems caused by population aging? many scholars have looked into the association between the aging population and ai. aisa et al. (2023) find that aging drives automation innovation. simultaneous increases in longevity can have a positive impact on the supply of highly skilled older labor, which in turn has a positive impact on the progress of automation. through theoretical and empirical investigations at the country and firm levels, acemoglu and restrepo (2017) prove that countries and firms with more severe aging tend to use ai in productive activities earlier and more often in order to compensate for the impact of aging. additionally, ai and labor exhibit a substitution relationship as well as complementary substitution and not a crowding-out substitution. ai is able to better cope with the adverse impacts of aging on growth in the economy, with regard to production intelligence, return on capital, total factor productivity, labor force structure, and efficiency of technological innovation, and promotes high-quality economic development (chen et al., 2019). at the same time, the application of ai can narrow the labor gap caused by population aging and better cope with the workforce gap due to population aging (filippi et al., 2023). therefore, if ai technology can be used wisely, then it will offer a greater contribution to china’s economy in the future in the context of aging. the foregoing discussion demonstrates that ai can effectively alleviate the labor shortage caused by an aging population and promote the smooth operation of the economy. however, most research on ai and population aging focuses on their effects on economic growth and labor markets with scant literature introducing ai to the effects of population aging on food security. to fill the gap in the literature, this study therefore uses provincial-level data from china to investigate further the role of ai in the process of population aging and how it affects food security. 3. theoretical analysis and hypothesis 3.1. impact of population aging on food security this paper presents the direct impact of population aging on food security, starting with an analysis of the characteristics of an elderly population. as the above literature review suggests, the impact of an aging population on food security is complex. in this part, we discuss why population aging does not hurt food security. the following explanations can be divided into insignificant effects and potentially positive effects of population aging on food security. first, the aging of the agricultural workforce directly influences the availability of labor in quantity as well as the physical strength of the labor force. however, with the development of farm mechanization and information technology, modern farm production technology and organization methods have also greatly reduced the constraints of individual physical strength (qiu et al., 2021). this means that food production is weakly dependent on the labor force but on machines. thus, population aging, while reducing the agricultural workforce’s physical strength and human capital, does not negatively impact food security. second, viewed from the perspective of production methods, china’s current food production is family-type small-scale production and has regional characteristics. mutual imitation and decision convergence among farmers make the demand for food production homogeneous regarding technology, machinery, and other factors. this lowers the demand for labor in the food production process, resulting in no significant effect of aging on food production (chen et al., 2022a, 2022b). third, in terms of production time, the opportunity cost of the farm workforce is lower for older laborers who have fewer opportunities and rewards for off-farm work compared to younger laborers (rigg et al., 2018; zhao et al., 2018). this gives them enough time and energy to engage in agricultural production. young farmers who are involved in part-time work are mainly employed in non-farm industries, their agricultural production is carried out in the leftover time of their nonfarm work, and their management time in the field is much less than that of older farmers (rigg et al., 2020; hussain and lee, 2022; ren et al., 2023). therefore, the intensity of crop cultivation is significantly higher among purely elderly farmers than part-time young farmers. fourth, in terms of human capital, although older agricultural laborers are physically disadvantaged, their technical efficiency in agricultural production is even higher than that of younger laborers due to their rich production experience and higher concentration in agricultural production. how farming practices such as fertilizers, pesticides and agrarian films are utilized depends on the agricultural knowledge and farming techniques that farmers have. the older and more experienced the agricultural labor force is, the more they know how to use the right amount of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. to enhance food production efficiency (li et al., 2016). while an aging workforce reduces the quantity and physical strength of the workforce, modern agricultural techniques and production methods have become much less demanding in terms of these conditions. factors such as mechanical substitution, socialized services, and collective decision-making also make up for the passive effects of an aging population. conversely, older agricultural laborers themselves have more sufficient time, energy, and experience than younger agricultural laborers, in turn benefiting agricultural production and food security. thus, the first hypothesis is proposed as follows: hypothesis 1. the population aging does not adversely alter food security. 3.2. the role of artificial intelligence the fundamental contradictions that prevent the modernization of china’s agriculture encompass the existing labor-based production model, the continuous reduction of the labor force, the scarcity of agricultural resources per capita, the low utilization of agricultural resources, the rejuvenation of new farmers, and the reduction of the workforce. some essential ways to resolve the above contradictions include relying on intelligent equipment to achieve precise, automated, and intelligent agricultural production and improving agricultural productivity, resource utilization, and land yield (labarthe et al., 2021; johnson et al., 2022; wang and lee, 2023). agricultural robots will be increasingly used in agriculture and the food industry as technology develops, and labor shortages due to an aging population and a high degree of automation are required (zhang et al., 2020; issa et al., 2022). under the background of rapid progress in the digital economy and the growing level of information technology in agriculture, the level of agricultural intelligence is also increasing (asongu et al., 2018; pauget and dammak, 2019). artificial intelligence technologies for land and irrigation control, climate prediction, plant cultivation, disease prediction, and livestock management make up critical functions that help ensure the sustainability of agriculture (filho et al., 2022; shaikh et al., 2022). agricultural ai technologies are used throughout the course of farm production. indeed, the implementation of precise, automated, and intelligent agricultural production through intelligent equipment reduces workforce needs, lowers labor’s physical requirements, and improves agricultural productivity, resource utilization, and land yield, thereby mitigating the effects of population aging on food security. population aging can adversely affect both the physical strength and human capital of the agricultural workforce, which are mitigated by the application of ai, which can then effectively replace agricultural labor in physical activities. an older agricultural workforce, while under a physical handicap, has an advantage over the younger agricultural workforce in terms of production experience and production focus. therefore, artificial intelligence can, on the one hand, compensate for c.-c. lee et al. technological forecasting & social change 199 (2024) 123062 5 the physical shortcomings of an older workforce and, on the other hand, make greater use of the advantages of an experienced older workforce to achieve more refined farming, maintain land productivity, and guarantee food security. the higher the degree of ai application is, the better it is to make use of the experience and time advantages of an older workforce, to compensate for the physical deficiencies of such a workforce, further exploit the spillover effects of elderly human capital, and to promote the improvement of agricultural production. thus, the second hypothesis is proposed as follows: hypothesis 2. ai plays a positive role in the impact of population aging on food security. 4. empirical models 4.1. econometric models 4.1.1. benchmark model to investigate the fundamental connection between population aging and food security, this study employs the following benchmark model throughout the paper: foodi,t = α0 +α1agingi,t + σ7 k=2 αkcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t , (1) where i indicates province and t denotes time (i = 1, …, 30; t = 2008, …, 2020). foodi,t is the dependent variable, representing food security. agingi,t is the independent variable, indicating the level of population aging, while controli,t is a series of control variables including food price index, urbanization rate, government finance, agricultural expenditure, technological progress and irrigation capacity. lastly, ωi represents province fixed effects, γt represents year fixed effects, εi,t means the error term, and α0 is the constant term, where αk (k = 1, …, 7) are the estimated coefficients. 4.1.2. moderating effect model this study uses a moderating effect model to verify the moderating mechanism of ai. foodi,t =b0 +b1agingi,t +b2moderatingi,t +b3agingi,t ×moderatingi,t + σ9 k=4 bkcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t , (2) where moderatingi,t is the moderating variable, ai. and b0 is the constant term, where bk (k = 1, …, 9) are the estimated coefficients. the remaining variables are explained in line with section 4.1.1. 4.1.3. threshold regression model to study the moderating role played by ai in the process of population aging affecting food security, we refer to the approach of lee et al. (2022b). this study uses a classical threshold regression model expressed as: foodi,t = c0 +c1agingi,t *i 􀀀 aii,t < q1 ) +c2agingi,t*i 􀀀 aii,t ≥ q1 ) + σ8 k=3 ckcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t , (3) where i() is a conditional function that is equal to 1 when the condition in parentheses is satisfied and equal to 0 when it is not. ai is the threshold variable, q1 stands for the estimated threshold. and c0 is the constant term, where ck (k = 1, …, 8) are the estimated coefficients. the remaining variables are explained in line with section 4.1.1. 4.1.4. did model to test the impact of the artificial intelligence policy, we adopt the did model, which is constructed as follows: foodi,t =d0 +d1didi,t +d2agingi,t +d3agingi,t ×didi,t + σ9 k=4 dkcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t, (4) where didi,t is the dummy variable, if a city i is taken into the treatment group in year t, didi,t = 1, otherwise, didi,t = 0 (hu et al., 2020; zhu and lee, 2022). and d0 is the constant term, where dk (k = 1, …, 9) are the estimated coefficients. the remaining variables are explained in line with section 4.1.1. 4.2. variables and data 4.2.1. dependent variable food security (food) is gauged through the logarithm of food production per capita. food possession per capita is an essential gauge of food security, and the amount of grain production per capita largely influences the degree of food security. therefore, based on previous studies, our research uses total food production divided by total population to measure the level of food security (gilland, 2002; zhang, 2011). 4.2.2. independent variables mainly following the practice of the literature (zeng et al., 2019), this study measures the degree of aging using the elderly population dependency ratio. however, since the main object of this paper is food production in rural areas, we employ the rural aging rate to measure the degree of rural population aging. 4.2.3. moderating variables artificial intelligence is measured in this paper using the density of industrial robots in the agricultural sector in each province. this paper focuses on the evolution of ai for agriculture, and the current application of ai in agriculture is mainly the input of industrial robots. therefore, this research mainly refers to the idea of (acemoglu and restrepo, 2020) and draws on the method of goldsmith-pinkham et al. (2020), based on the idea of the bartik instrumental variable, to construct the density of industrial robots in china’s agricultural sector so as to measure ai’s application and development level in agriculture. the calculation formula is: aii,j,t = labori,j,t labori,t × robotj,t laborj,t (5) where aii,j,t denotes the density of industrial robots at the agricultural level in period t in region i, labori,j,t is the number of people employed in agriculture in period t in region i, labori,t is the total number of workers in all industries in period t in region i, and laborj,t is the total number of agriculture workforce nationwide in period t. data for industrial robots are from the international federation of robotics (ifr) report. 4.2.4. control variables this paper draws on previous studies and incorporates some necessary control variables to enhance the credibility of the empirical results. these include food price index, urbanization rate, government finance, agricultural expenditure, technological progress and irrigation capacity. (1) the food price index (dp) reflects changes in food prices. several literatures have examined the impact of food price changes and found that higher food prices incentivize more food production and that higher food prices can stimulate agricultural supply in the short run and also increase agricultural productivity in the long run (nose and yamauchi, 2016; gozgor, 2019; headey and hirvonen, 2023). therefore, this paper includes food price as a control variable in the empirical study. (2) urbanization (urban), the increase of urbanization level will lead to the loss of rural labor and agricultural land, thus affecting food production. deng and gibson (2019) find that there is a trade-off c.-c. lee et al. technological forecasting & social change 199 (2024) 123062 6 between agricultural production and urbanization and that the level of urbanization has an important relationship with agricultural production (jiang et al., 2022; guo et al., 2023). (3) as a degree of government intervention (gov), government expenditure plays an important role in socio-economic development and influences agriculture development (hussain et al., 2022; nie and lee, 2023). governments can change taxes and expenditures through fiscal policy to control aggregate demand, which will further affect employment, national income, and all aspects of economic and social development (jiang et al., 2022; tang and sun, 2022). this paper quantifies fiscal policy in terms of the government’s budgetary expenditure as a share of gdp. (4) the extent of government financial support for agriculture (agr) denotes government financial assistance to agriculture. a region’s agricultural development requires government grants and price subsidies, so the government’s financial strength will have an important impact on regional agricultural production. this paper draws on shen et al. (2022) and zhang et al. (2022) to include government financial support for agriculture in the empirical study. (5) technological progress (ti) reflects the level of scientific and technological development of a region. technological progress is an important driver of economic development (chen et al., 2020; lin et al., 2021; lou et al., 2024). chandio et al. (2021) find that technological progress has a positive impact on food production. shen et al. (2022) also point out that the green growth of agriculture is largely driven by technological progress, so technology has an important role in the process of agricultural development. this paper uses patents to measure technological progress based on the research of lee et al. (2023). (6) irrigation capacity (irrigation) reflects the ability and level of agricultural irrigation in a region. agricultural irrigation has an important position in the production process of food crops, lu et al. (2019) proposed the constraints of water resource limitations on agricultural production and agricultural planting structure and suggested the relationship between irrigation water and irrigation, which discusses the importance of agricultural irrigation for agricultural production. in this paper, the effective irrigated area is used to measure the irrigation capacity of a region. many research studies show that irrigation capacity has important impacts on agricultural production (cao et al., 2015; kang et al., 2017; cao et al., 2018). this paper identifies the above variables as control variables based on reality and other studies. table a1 in the appendix presents the detailed definition and information of each variable. 4.3. sample data this research collects data from provincial administrative regions in china. considering that the agricultural land systems in hong kong, macau, and taiwan are different from those in the mainland, and due to the absence of some data in tibet, the empirical study excludes those four. overall, this study utilizes data from 30 provinces. data for industrial robots are from the ifr report, and the data required for other variables are from the official website of the national bureau of statistics, the china rural statistical yearbook, the china population and employment statistical yearbook, the tertiary industry statistical yearbook, the china statistical yearbook, and provincial statistical yearbooks. the years of data collected are from 2008 to 2020, and some missing data are filled by linear interpolation. descriptive statistics are performed prior to the empirical analysis, and table 1 presents those of the primary variables. to prevent the problem of multicollinearity, correlation tests are executed on the significant variables. table 2 reports the correlation coefficient matrix of the main variables. the correlation coefficients between all the variables are below 0.8. in addition, the variance inflation factors shown in table 3 are all <10. thus, the model does not suffer from severe multicollinearity problems. table 4 reports the results of the panel unit root test, showing that the variables used in this paper are stationary sequences (lee et al., 2022b,c). 5. benchmark results 5.1. benchmark regression table 5 lists the outcomes of the benchmark regression. first, we use a two-way fixed effects model for regression estimation, which reflects the underlying relationship between the variables. to verify the robustness of the benchmark regression, this study adopts the method of sequentially joining control variables and varying the type of fixed effects. in the table, given increasing control variables, both province and year effects are controlled for, and the coefficient of aging is always statistically significant in a positive direction. changing the type of fixed effects based on the addition of control variables also does not change the underlying results. this implies that population aging does not adversely alter food security, which is in line with the theoretical analysis in section 3.1. this also confirms the previous hypothesis 1. 5.2. robust test 5.2.1. iv-2sls previous findings confirm that population aging does not adversely affect food security, but this result may be biased due to endogeneity issues. for instance, there are missing variables. even though this paper uses control variables and fixed effects, there are still some factors affecting food production that are difficult to observe and control. however, this paper does not give much consideration to reverse causation, as food security is unlikely to drive regional trends in population aging. although demographic changes are inherently exogenous, to better deal with endogeneity due to the model’s omission of variables, inter-causality and measurement error, this section uses a two-stage instrumental variables regression to re-estimate the effect of population aging on food security. baochang et al. (2007) categorize 30 provinces into four levels based on the intensity of family planning policies. this paper draws on tan et al. (2022) to create an ordered categorical variable. the higher the value, the stricter the implementation of family planning policies. since this variable is a cross-sectional variable, our study employs panel data. therefore, we deal with the model’s endogeneity by constructing the product term of the categorical variable of family planning policies and the national elderly population dependency ratio in the following year as the instrumental variable. instrumental variables have to satisfy both correlation and exogeneity conditions. on the one hand, china implemented family planning in the 1970s, a policy that changed the fertility rate at the time, which in turn changed the demographic structure and ultimately affected the extent of population aging. in short, the stricter the implementation of family planning policies, the more the population ages. on the other hand, family planning policies do not directly affect food production and are well exogenous. specifically, given that the study sample in this table 1 descriptive statistics. variable obs. mean std. dev. min max food 390 0.460 0.383 0.013 2.347 old 390 0.168 0.061 0.071 0.446 aging 390 0.116

is panel data, endogeneity cannot be handled using only family planning policies due to the use of fixed effects. therefore, this study refers to nunn and qian (2014) and uses the interaction term between the intensity of family planning policies and the national elderly population dependency ratio in the following year as an instrumental variable. future national elderly population dependency ratios will not affect food production in the current year. in sum, this paper chooses the cross-multiplier term between the intensity of family planning policies and the national elderly population dependency ratio in the following year to deal with endogeneity. table 6 reports the relevant results of iv-2sls estimation, in which the unidentifiable test, the weak instrumental variable test, and the over-identification test all pass. column (1) presents the results of the first-stage regressions, where the instrumental variables and rural population aging positively and significantly correlated at the 1 % level. this suggests that stricter implementation of family planning policies leads to higher levels of population aging. column (2) reports the outcomes of the second-stage regression, where the regression coefficient is significantly positive at the 1 % level, or in line with the results of the benchmark regression. this suggests that the underlying conclusions remain robust and convincing after dealing with endogeneity. 5.2.2. alternate independent variables to verify the robustness of the basic regression conclusion, this section replaces the measurement of the core explanatory variable from the rural old-age dependency ratio to the rural population aging rate. the regression outcome in column (3) of table 6 notes that the coefficient of old is significantly positive, or in line with the findings of the benchmark regression. this indicates that the underlying conclusions have a high degree of confidence. 5.2.3. adding control variables many research studies show that industrial structure and degree of openness also impact agricultural production (matthews, 2014; cao et al., 2015; kang et al., 2017; cao et al., 2018; fusco et al., 2020; song et al., 2021). thus, to further mitigate the omitted variable problem, this study adds two new variables, industrial structure and degree of openness, to the original control variables. industrial structure (is) is measured by the share of value added of the secondary and tertiary sectors in gdp. the degree of openness (open) is expressed as the percentage of total foreign-invested imports and exports (converted at the current year’s usd to rmb exchange rate) to gdp. table 6 reports the outcomes for adding control variables. the regression results in columns (4) to (6) of the table show that is has a negative effect while openness has a significantly positive impact on ensuring food security, and that the aging rate of the rural population remains significantly positive after table 2

variables for a more accurate reflection of the characteristics of most samples and to avoid extreme values from influencing the outcomes, this research winsorizes the variables at the 1 %, 2.5 %, and 7.5 % quantiles. table 6 lists the outcomes and we notice that the coefficients of aging are significantly positive, which proves the conclusion is robust. 6. the role of artificial intelligence 6.1. moderating effect analysis 6.1.1. full-sample regression ai has become an important tool that can help deal with an aging population (wang et al., 2023). today, ai is also starting to dominate the agricultural sector (ennouri et al., 2021; shaikh et al., 2022). on the one hand, an alternative role of ai is that it reduces the farming burden and physical requirements of agricultural laborers (acemoglu and restrepo, 2018a, 2018b). on the other hand, the efficient application of ai can better utilize the advantages of older people with more farming experience and agricultural labor inputs. in the context of an aging population, the use of ai can effectively ensure food security. these points are discussed in detail in section 3.2. on the basis of previous theoretical analysis, ai has a moderating effect on population aging’s influence on food security. exploring the possible moderating mechanism of ai in the process of food security affected by population aging, this paper adds the interaction term of ai and aging/old to the original benchmark regression model. centralization is also performed to weaken the multicollinearity of the original table 5 benchmark regression. variable

the outcomes of the moderating effects without and with the addition of control variables. the regression outcomes reveal that the coefficients of the interaction terms are all significantly positive, indicating that ai serves as a positive moderating factor in population aging’s impact on food security. this is consistent with hypothesis 2. 6.1.2. subsample regression after the initial analysis of the moderating role of ai, to further analyze the differences in the moderating role of ai in different regions, this part continues the study by using a sub-sample regression method. we divide the sample into two dimensions: economic geography subregion and food production subregion. table 8 reports the results after subsample regression. first, from the point of view of economic-geographical subdivisions, china can be divided into three regions: east, central and west. columns (1) to (3) report the estimation results. based on the results, it can be found that the coefficients of the interaction terms are significantly positive in all three regions, indicating that ai has a moderating effect in all three regions. however, the moderating ability of ai varies across the three regions. the magnitude of the moderating effect is ranked in descending order of west, central and east. one of the possible reasons is that the economy of the eastern region is developed, with a high level of urbanization and industrialization, and the industrial structure is dominated by the tertiary industry as well as new industries. the function of agricultural production is mainly shifted to the central and western regions, and the advanced manufacturing industry and the service industry mainly drive the economic development of the eastern region. therefore, the resources invested in the field of agriculture are limited, and the role of artificial intelligence development in promoting agricultural production is also limited. compared with the eastern region, the central and western regions have the advantages of good agricultural infrastructure, suitable natural conditions, sufficient arable land resources, strong government policy support, more experienced agricultural labor, and large-scale production mode. these conditions provide a prerequisite and guarantee for the role of artificial intelligence. therefore, it is more conducive to the large-scale application of ai in agriculture in the central and western regions, and it is better to play the role of ai in agriculture. in terms of food production subregions, columns (4) to (6) report the estimation results, and the moderating role of ai plays a significant role only in the main food marketing areas. main grain production areas are key grain production areas where geography, soil, climate, technology, and other conditions are suitable for the cultivation of certain grain crops and where they have certain comparative advantages such as resource advantages, technological advantages, and economic benefits. however, ai has not played its own advantages in these areas, indicating that the development and application of ai are not coordinated with the pattern of agricultural production. although the agricultural infrastructure of the main grain production areas is superior, they tend to have lower economic levels, slower technological development, and lower levels of ai application. although the main grain marketing areas have a weak agricultural base, the development level of artificial intelligence is high and can be applied to agricultural production. therefore, the application of artificial intelligence, an emerging technology in agriculture, has yet to be further promoted in the main food-producing areas. 6.2. threshold regression analysis in this part, we explore the impact of population aging on food security at different levels of ai. this is done by examining the relationships among ai, population aging, and food security using ai as a threshold variable. table 9 presents the outcome of the threshold selection after applying the bootstrap approach. the p-values and their significant levels are obtained by repeating the sampling 300 times to determine the number of thresholds and threshold values. the results show that it passes the single threshold test. table 10 reveals the results of the single-threshold regression with ai as the threshold variable. they denote that the impact of population aging on food security varies at different levels of ai development: the coefficient of 0.937 is significant at the 10 % level when the level of ai development is below the threshold (ai <0.2587); while the coefficient of ai development level across the threshold (ai ≥0.2587) rises to 2.104 and is significant at the 1 % level. this suggests that the impact of population aging on food security is better at higher levels of ai application. the empirical results are consistent with previous findings, whereby artificial intelligence empowers the older rural workforce to improve its role in food security. 6.3. the artificial intelligence policy analysis in this part, a classic artificial intelligence policy is used to further table 7

social change 199 (2024) 123062 10 analyze the role of ai in the impact of population aging on food security. in 2015, the state council in china issued the “guiding opinions on actively promoting internet actions”, which listed the internet and artificial intelligence as key actions. at that time, 12 provinces, including shanghai, beijing, chongqing, guangdong, zhejiang, anhui, guizhou, jiangxi, shandong, shaanxi, jilin and heilongjiang, responded to the call and issued local policies related to artificial intelligence. thus, the above provinces are taken into a treatment group and other cities are taken into the control group. based on the did model, we construct a quasi-natural experiment, and the relevant results are shown in columns (1) and (2) of table 11. the result in column (1) shows that the coefficient of did is significantly positive, indicating that the artificial intelligence policy benefits food security. the result in column (2) shows that the coefficient of aging*did is significantly positive, indicating that the ai policy plays a positive role in the impact of population aging on food security. passing the parallel trend test is a prerequisite for using the did model. thus, taking the fourth year before policy implementation as a base period, we conducted a parallel trend test, and the relevant results are shown in fig. 2. it can be seen that there is no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group before the implementation of the policy, indicating that the parallel trend test passes. to further demonstrate that this policy is not accidental, we conduct a placebo test. the result is presented in fig. 3. construct 1000 times a virtual experimental group and control group randomly and capture t-value of each time to form the nuclear density distribution map. the distribution is normal and the t-value is concentrated at 0, indicating that the policy effect of this artificial intelligence is not table

11 accidental. due to the influence of sample selection, the results of did may be biased. therefore, we reassessed the impact of this policy in conjunction with psm. three main matching methods, including psm-neighboring, psm-kernel, and entropy balancing, are used in this part. the results of psm-did are shown in column (3) to (8) of table 11. we can find that the results of psm-did model are consistent with the results of did model, showing that our findings are robust. 6.4. policy implications based on the research findings, this paper makes policy recommendations in terms of both the rural older labor force and ai development. for the rural labor force of the elderly population. first, the government should respond to the trend of aging by vigorously developing the rural pension service industry, including pension, medical care and insurance, to improve further the social security system and life productivity of the rural elderly population and to unleash the productive potential of the elderly population. second, the government can encourage rural laborers to take the initiative to participate in online and offline vocational skills training, guide agricultural workers to acquire new knowledge and skills to adapt to changing agricultural production conditions, and help to build a large contingent of knowledgeand skill-based agricultural workers to effectively meet agricultural production needs. for the development of artificial intelligence. first, the government fig. 2. parallel trend test. fig. 3. placebo test. c.-c. lee et al. technological forecasting & social change 199 (2024) 123062 12 should increase investment in infrastructure, improve network, software, and storage to provide support for ai applications. these infrastructure improvements can include the construction of high-speed internet, the promotion of cloud computing technology, the development of big data platforms. second, the government can strengthen the training of ai-related talents, train more ai researchers and users, and provide more human support for the development of artificial intelligence. third, the government needs to formulate and improve artificial intelligence policies and regulations to promote the development and application of artificial intelligence. these policies and regulations can include financial support for research and development, tax incentives, and market access rules to stimulate enterprises to increase investment in ai. 7. conclusion 7.1. main conclusions with the increasing prominence of aging populations worldwide, food security is gaining greater attention. at the same time, the rapid development of ai provides new solutions to address the labor gap due to an aging population. most of the existing literature has studied the ability of ai to cope with the adverse impacts of population aging in terms of economic growth and industrial structure. yet, scant research has considered the application and effects of ai in the field of agricultural production. therefore, this paper selects data from a sample of 30 provinces in china to analyze the impact of population aging on food security and the role of artificial intelligence. based on detailed theoretical analysis and empirical tests, the conclusions obtained are as follows. first, modern agricultural production techniques and organization have greatly reduced the constraints of individual physical strength and human capital on agricultural production. population aging in rural areas has not negatively impacted food security. therefore, there is no need to be too pessimistic about the inevitable aging of the rural population. second, ai has a positive effect on the impact of population aging on food security, and so the application of ai is beneficial to food security. third, the moderating effect of ai is heterogeneous. compared with other provinces, ai can play a strongly positive moderating effect in central and west regions and major grain-selling areas. 7.2. limitations and prospects in this part, we propose some possible research prospects based on the limitations of the article. first, the data can be more refined. our article uses provincial-level data to analyze topics of “impact of population aging on food security in the context of artificial intelligence”. if city-level data is used, the heterogeneity of this impact can be described in more detail. thus, future research could look at collecting city-level data on food security, which is currently difficult to collect and needs to be mined in government reports or other documents. second, the spatial spillover effect can be explored. this paper considers the impact in an individual region and ignores possible spatial spillover effects. therefore, the follow-up research can adopt the method of spatial econometrics to study this topic further. ethical approval this article does not contain any
