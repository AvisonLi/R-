candidates for the repair of robust biological tissues should exhibit diverse features such as biocompatibility, strength, toughness, self-healing ability and a well-defined structure. among the available biomaterials, hydrogels, as highly hydrated 3d-crosslinked polymeric networks, are promising for tissue engineering purposes as result of their high resemblance with native extracellular matrix. however, these polymeric structures often exhibit a poor mechanical behavior, hampering their use in load-bearing applications. during the last years, several efforts have been made to create new strategies and concepts to fabricate strong and tough hydrogels. although it is already possible to shape the mechanical properties of artificial hydrogels to mimic biotissues, critical issues regarding, for instance, their biocompatibility and hierarchical structure are often neglected. therefore, this review covers the structural and mechanical characteristics of the developed methodologies to toughen hydrogels, highlighting some pioneering efforts employed to combine the aforementioned properties in natural-based hydrogels.  2015 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.

blood vessels and tendons are characterized by a high water content, load bearing ability (i.e. strength), fracture resistance (i.e. toughness) and softness (i.e. low modulus) [1]. for instance, cartilage, which contains about 75 wt% of water, is able to undertake a remarkable compressive stress of several mpa [2] without fracture, exhibits a toughness of more than 1000 j m2 and a nominal compressive modulus of 0.1–1.0 mpa [3]. this extraordinary mechanical behavior have been ascribed to a plethora of molecular and structural events occurring in biological tissues [4]. an optimal device for the repair of robust biological soft tissues either based on regeneration or replacement strategies should meet several criteria such as, (i) strength to sustain the applied force, (ii) biocompatibility resorting, for instance, to natural polymers, (iii) a well-defined structure from the molecular to the macroscopic levels and (iv) recoverability to reversibly deform without fracture [1,5–8]. in the last years, many groups have been focusing their efforts in order to create these multifunctional systems combining the aforementioned properties [9]. one class of such materials are hydrogels, which consist of three-dimensional solid networks made from crosslinked hydrophilic polymer chains [10]. owing to their outstanding characteristics such as water absorption and retention ability, biocompatibility and tunable physical, chemical and biological properties, these polymeric networks are excellent candidates for a broad range of biomedical applications [11], which include scaffolds for tissue engineering (te) [12–14], carriers for drug delivery [11,15–18], molecular filters in biological science [19–21], superabsorbent devices in disposable diapers [22] and valves for microfluidics [23–25]. furthermore, when exposed to an environmental signal such as temperature and ph, some sensitive hydrogels are able to respond and translate this stimulus into a macroscopic event, allowing their application as sensors and/or actuators and smart drug release devices [9,26–32]. but, perhaps, the most interesting feature about these 3d networks is their high resemblance, in terms of structure and physical properties, with the native extracellular matrix (ecm), highlighting their potential for te and biomedical purposes [11,33–37]. however, their use in stress-bearing applications is often hindered since hydrogels, when highly swollen, often lack of mechanical properties such as strength, toughness, elongation and recoverability [20,38,39]. this poor mechanical performance is in high contrast with native structural hydrogels such as cartilage and may result in unintended failure in vivo [40]. considering the aforementioned drawback, hydrogels were classified as mechanical weak materials, and hence, little attention was paid to them as artificial substitutes of load-bearing soft tissues. nevertheless, in the last few years, new strategies and concepts have been developed to toughen hydrogels including double networks [41], topological [42] and nanocomposite hydrogels [43]; allowing the application of these 3d structures, for instance, as artificial substitutes of native tissues with structural properties similar to hydrogels such as skin [44], heart valves [45], spinal disks [46], cartilage [8], muscles and nerves [47,48]. in particular, natural-origin polymers are good candidates for biomedical applications as a result of their biocompatibility [49], low cost and easiness to process into hydrogels [50]. although the chemical structure of synthetic polymers is easily controlled when comparing with natural polymers, they often lack of cell-signaling and cell-interactive motifs which are difficult to mimic in laboratory and are extremely important for the material integration with the surrounding tissues [51,52]. several natural-based polymers have been investigated for this purpose [53] including proteins such as collagen [54] and gelatin [55]; and polysaccharides such as cellulose [56], chitosan [57], hyaluronan [58] and chondroitin sulfate [59]. however, the brittleness of these hydrogels is in great contrast with the toughness of biological tissues, showing fracture energies of about 0.1–10 j m2 [60,61], tensile moduli ranging from 10 to 104 pa [62] and compressive fracture stresses lower a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 345 than 1 mpa [63]. consequently, many efforts have been done in order to apply the previously stated methods to create tough structures made of natural polymers for load-bearing biomedical applications. from all the available materials in nature, polymers are the main constitutes of living organisms and, remarkably, biotissues exhibit a huge variety of functionalities [4]. this diversity has been ascribed to the tissues well-defined and complex structuring and, in this regard, the control over the hydrogel structure at all levels of hierarchy is also crucially important for the construction of biotissues substitutes [64–66]. another critical point that should be addressed during the design of artificial structural biomaterials is the material self-healing ability, which contributes to the development of longer-lasting products. self-repairing, which is the ability of materials to heal from their cracks, is found in biological materials such as in bones [67], wood [68] and skin [69]. this property is often achieved by a dynamic bond breaking/reforming upon deformation, which protects the material backbone from macroscopic fracture [4,70]. this nature inspired feature can be mimicked by replacing irreversible covalent crosslinks by non-covalent ones, which often result in the overall increase of hydrogels’ toughness [70]. hydrogels with self-healing properties have been synthesized using different reversible interactions, for instance, electrostatic [71], hydrogen [72,73] and hydrophobic [74]. this review covers the recent advances done to produce artificial soft tissues with the aforementioned characteristics. first, some pioneering work to fabricate hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties will be described, highlighting the design concept employed and their network structure as well as the mechanism behind their outstanding toughness. although hydrogels synthesized through these strategies exhibit superior mechanical properties, in most cases, not enough attention was paid on the biocompatibility, self-healing and their macro/micro-structure. therefore, it will then focus on some natural-origin tough hydrogels produced employing the previous methodologies and their attempt to be applied as substitutes of biological tissues. throughout this review, particular emphasis will be done on tough hydrogels devices with a well-defined architecture and self-healing properties. 2. hydrogels with reinforced mechanical properties hydrogels are stable in aqueous solutions by virtue of crosslinking points, which can be formed either by a covalent or non-covalent mechanism, and thus, yielding chemical or physical hydrogels, respectively. while chemical hydrogels can be produced by radical polymerization, energy irradiation, chemical reactions between complementary groups and/or enzymatic crosslinking; physical networks are often the result of changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and ph, molecular entanglements and/or supramolecular interactions [75,76]. on the one hand, physical hydrogels generally have the advantages of gel formation under mild conditions and avoiding the use of organic solvents. on the other hand, chemical hydrogels have often higher mechanical properties but need toxic crosslinkers and/or solvents [19]. generally speaking, the mechanical properties of hydrogels arise mainly from two aspects: the intrinsic rigidity of the polymer chains and the crosslinking density [33]. although their mechanical strength can be slightly enhanced by increasing the polymer concentration or the crosslinking density, single network hydrogels often lack of mechanical properties [77]. this inherent poor mechanical behavior is the result of various factors such as the (i) irregular distribution of crosslinking points per unit volume (crosslinking density), (ii) different polymer chains length between the crosslinking points (inter-crosslinking molecular weight) [78,79], (iii) high water content [80] and/or (iv) lack of energy-dissipation mechanisms to prevent the crack propagation [9]. structure inhomogeneity, which results from the random aggregation of crosslinking points, occurs typically during the hydrogel formation. the former phenomenon is due to the differences in reactivity between the monomer and the crosslinker as more densely crosslinked regions are initially formed and later connected by large chains [81]. moreover, when using crosslinking agents, it is difficult to ensure that the crosslinking process will occur at regularly separated positions, resulting in a broad distribution on the chains length. accordingly, upon loading, the stress cannot be evenly distributed on the hydrogels chains and they start to break from the weakest link, reducing the overall mechanical properties [82,83]. concerning the amount of water uptake, it is known that high water contents result in the reduction of the crosslinking density, which in turn, reduces the fracture energy as fewer chains are needed to be broken in order for the crack to propagate. additionally, energy-dissipation mechanisms, for instance, through crystallization or viscoelastic energy dissipation are also reduced by the separation of network chains in swollen hydrogels [84]. hence, substantial efforts have been done to design and fabricate strong hydrogel structures. while some of the research groups focus their work in creating homogeneous structures, others take advantage of their heterogeneity. the careful synthesis of networks with a narrow inter-crosslinking molecular weight results in hydrogels with superior mechanical properties when comparing with their equivalent heterogeneous networks, because the applied load can be evenly distributed over their chains [85]. contrarily, there are some studies suggesting that an optimization of the structural inhomogeneity rather than its removal, leads to a drastic improvement on the mechanical properties [19]. in this section, we will present some of the developed approaches to prepare tough and strong hydrogels. although most of the concepts presented here are not suitable for cell encapsulation purposes due to their harsh processing conditions, these hydrogel systems are prospective candidates as artificial substitutes of load-bearing soft tissues owing to their enhanced mechanical behavior. these outstanding mechanical properties are the result of the incorporation of several entities in the hydrogel structure, namely: 346 a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 2.1. functional end groups 2.1.1. tetra-poly(ethylene)glycol (tetra-peg) gel solving the inherent inhomogeneity of conventional hydrogels, sakai et al. reported a method to fabricate strong and homogeneous polymeric networks by mixing two symmetrical tetrahedron-like macromonomers of the same size [82]. each monomer consisted in a four-arm poly ethylene glycol (peg) macromer with a tetrahedron-like structure differing on the functional terminal group; either an amine or succinimidyl ester (fig. 1, tetra-peg gel) [82]. a uniform 3d-network structure, with negligible topological defects such as entanglements [86], was obtained through the formation of amide bonds between the terminal groups when the stoichiometric ratio between the two macromonomers was unitary [87]. these gels exhibit a maximum compression stress and modulus of ca. 2.5 mpa and 40 kpa, respectively, by virtue of their extremely homogeneous and well-defined structure. additionally, the tetra-peg hydrogels have the advantages of in-situ gel formation and biocompatibility, which is of extreme importance for biomedical purposes [82]. 2.1.2. click chemistry-based (ccb) gel a similar concept to the previously stated was used to fabricate homogeneous hydrogels using click chemistry [88,89], specifically through the copper (i)-catalyzed formation of 1,2,3-triazoles from azides and terminal acetylenes [90]. diacetylene- and tetraazide-functionalized peg derivatives were mixed in presence of copper, which due to the selective chemical reaction employed resulted in a uniformly crosslinked network with improved mechanical properties (fig. 1, ccb gel). indeed, the obtained hydrogels were highly stretchable (ca. up to 1550%) with a tensile strength of ca. 2.39 mpa, which was also attributed to the well-defined architecture of these hydrogels [91]. moreover, the unreacted terminal groups can be used to incorporate different molecules into the hydrogel network without affecting its formation. 2.2. sliding crosslinks 2.2.1. topological (tp) gel a gel with a very elegant molecular design based on sliding crosslinks, named topological (tp) gel, was firstly presented by okumura in 2001 [42]. tp hydrogels can be prepared from polyrotaxanes in which a long polymeric chain is sparsely populated with numerous cyclic molecules caged by large bulky end groups [92]. flexible, transparent and superabsorbent gels were produced by incorporating a-cyclodextrins (a-cd) along the chains of a high molecular weight peg polymer followed by the covalent crosslinking of pairs of a-cds through the action of cyanuric chloride (fig. 1, tp gel) [42]. one of the interesting features about these hydrogels is related with the absence of crosslinking points on the polymeric chains as they are, instead, topological interlocked by a figure-of-eight crosslinkers. as result of the former characteristic and contrarily to fixed chemical or physical crosslinked hydrogels [93], the cyclic molecules are able to slide along the polymeric chain with the aim of equalizing the applied tension (pulley effect) [94]. this unique structure allow these hydrogels to bear extensions up to 20 times their original length without fracture as the gel elasticity is a consequence of only the chain’s topology [95]. 2.3. nanostructures 2.3.1. nanocomposite (nc) gel another approach is based on the incorporation of nanostructures into the main hydrogel network. one example is the nanocomposite (nc) hydrogel which is composed of polymeric chains (organic part) and clay, natural mineral silicate, nanoplatelets (inorganic part) [96]. this hybrid organic/inorganic structure is simply produced by first exfoliating inorganic clays followed by their uniform dispersion in an aqueous solution. specific organic monomers are used to fix the clays nanosheets in this dispersed state and subsequently, the in-situ free radical polymerization is thermally initiated above the clay surface. the clay nanosheets act as multifunctional crosslinkers of the polymer chains since the chain end groups adsorb strongly on this surface by ionic and coordination interactions. in fact, several individual chains are able to attach to a single inorganic substrate. therefore, a transparent, robust, 3d structure composed of flexible polymeric chains connected with different inorganic clay sheets is obtained. for example, the nc hydrogel composed of inorganic synthetic hectrite ([mg5.34li0.66si8o20(oh)4]na0.66) clay slab connected by n-isopropyl acrylamide (nipam) polymeric chains using potassium peroxodisulfate (kps) as radical initiator is highly stretchable (ca. higher than 1000%) and exhibit a high elastic recoverability (ca. 98% of the total deformation), illustrating its overall robustness (fig. 1, nc gel) [43]. these hydrogels are tough, i.e. highly resistant to crack propagation, as in order for this process to occur every single chain connecting different clay sheets need to be broken. furthermore, nc hydrogels properties also include excellent swelling ability (ca. 500 times) and enhanced stimuli sensitivity as the polymer chains are not molecularly restricted by crosslinking points contrarily to what happen on chemical hydrogels [97]. moreover, the high uniformity of these hydrogels is proved by their transparence, which is in high contrast with the conventional hydrogels opacity. nc hydrogels drawbacks include (i) the relative low amount of inorganic clay that can be used to produce these hydrogels (typically lower than 12 wt%) as consequence of the nanoplatelets aggregation, which, in turn, leads to lower mechanical properties, and (ii) their lack of self-healing ability. a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 347 fig. 1. schematic representation and chemical structure of the different strategies described to create strong and tough hydrogels devices, namely: tetra-poly(ethylene) glycol (tetra-peg) gel, click chemistrybased (ccb) gel, topological (tp) gel, nanocomposite (nc) gel, macromolecular microspheres composite (mmc) gel, ionically crosslinked triblock copolymer (itc) gel, hydrophobic interactions-based (hib) gel, polyampholytes (pa) gel, lamellar bilayer (lb) gel and double-network (dn) gel. 348 a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 2.3.2. layered nanocomposite (l-nc) gel one strategy to solve the first problem is based on mimicking the nacre micro- and nano-structure, which curiously constitutes also an inorganic/organic nanocomposite [66]. nacre outstanding elastic modulus, strength and toughness emerge from its well-ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement into organic and inorganic layers [42]. a layered nc (l-nc) was developed by incorporating the clay platelets (laponite xlg, [mg5.34li0.66si8o20(oh)4]na0.66) in a nipam monomer solution containing an initiator. the nanoplatelets were assembled into a lamellar structure by vacuum filtration. after uv irradiation, the in-situ radical polymerization of nipam was initiated, forming the l-nc hydrogel [98]. the superior mechanical properties of the l-nc hydrogels compared with the other nc structures, further proved the importance of designing well-defined microstructures to obtain robust hydrogels. 2.3.3. dendritic nanocomposite (d-nc) gel due to the poor self-healing ability of nc hydrogels, a new supramolecular approach was developed, combining clay nanosheets, dendritic macromolecules and sodium polyacrylate (asap) at mild conditions [99]. the dendritic macromolecules work as ‘‘molecular glue’’ of the nanosheets and are composed of peg chains containing two dendrons units with terminal guanidinium ions [100]. to fabricate these hydrogels, the clay nanosheets were also exfoliated and dispersed homogeneously in water due to the possible repulsion between their positive-charged edge parts and anionic asap. then, the oxyanions presented on the clay nanosheets react with the dendrons yielding a strong hydrogel with self-healing ability. remarkably, when placing in contact freshly cut surfaces of these hydrogels they were able to adhere to each other, showing their capability to recover after structure damage. while the nanosheets are responsible for the high hydrogel strength since they are the main component of this 3d network, the self-healing process is a consequence of the non-covalent attachment of the guanidinium ions with the exfoliated nanosheets [99]. 2.4. microparticles 2.4.1. macromolecular microspheres composite (mmc) gel similar to the nc hydrogels, macromolecular microspheres composite (mmc) networks also allow the control of the crosslinking density and the inter-crosslinking distance, but without the need of an inorganic counterpart, being formed through covalent attachment of network chains to the microparticles. mmc hydrogels were designed by reacting surface activated macromolecular microspheres with polymeric monomers as shown by huang et al. [101]. after the irradiation with 60co c-rays in the presence of oxygen, peroxides were formed on the surface of macromolecular microspheres, which are composed of styrene and butyl acrylate monomers. these groups under heat form free radicals which act as both crosslinkers (responsible for the covalent grafting of poly(acrylic acid) (paa) monomers on the mms) and initiators (responsible for starting paa homopolymerization). this method results in a tough hydrogel due to its well-defined structure, consisting of mms particles connected by paa long chains, which are able to sustain the stress cooperatively (fig. 1, mmc). moreover, inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds can also occur between paa chains, working as an energy dissipation mechanism [102]. in fact, mmc hydrogel (89 wt% water content) sustained a compressive stress of 10.2 mpa for a strain of 97.9%. after loading, the hydrogel structure elastically recovered its original shape for strains higher than 90%. it is worth to notice that by decreasing the water content, a higher compressive stress (78.6 mpa at 99.3% strain) was obtained but the hydrogels were permanently deformed. moreover, their use as cell encapsulation vehicles could be hampered by the need for c-rays [101]. 2.5. supramolecular interactions 2.5.1. ionically crosslinked triblock copolymer (itc) gel in this technique developed by henderson et al. [103] a amphiphilic triblock copolymer consisting of a midblock made of poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) and end blocks of poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma) was physically crosslinked through both (i) ionic crosslinks between the polyelectrolyte mildblocks and (ii) glass spherical domains on pmma end blocks (fig. 1, itc). briefly, this copolymer was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then subjected to a vapor phase solvent exchange process to create the glassy spherical aggregates. the ionic crosslinks were obtain by immersing the physically crosslinked hydrogels into a buffered cation (zn2+, ca2+, ni2+, co2+ and cu2+) solution. tough (1.4 mj m3) and strong (ca. 1 mpa) itc hydrogels were obtained by the reversible association/dissociation of the ionic crosslinks bridging the pmma glass domains [103]. 2.5.2. hydrophobic interactions-based (hib) gel the presence of hydrophobic associations can also serve as a dissipation mechanism since after the unloading, they are able to re-assemble, leading to the hydrogel recovery [104]. hydrophobic interactions can be achieved by introducing hydrophobic sequences within hydrophilic polymeric network via micellar polymerization [105]. combining self-healing, obtained by the presence of supramolecular bonds, with good mechanical properties is non-trivial as these bonds are relatively weak when comparing with covalent ones. acknowledging this shortcoming, gulyuz et al. proposed a new strategy using hydrophobically modified paa polyelectrolyte with oppositely charged cetyltrimethylammonium (cta) surfactant. these 3d structures were produced via micellar copolymerization of hydrophilic aa with hydrophobic stearyl methacrylate by free radical polymerization in ctab aqueous solution containing nabr (fig. 1, hib) [106]. the attained supramolecular hydrogels exhibited a strength as high as 1.7 mpa and elongation at break of 900%. remarkably, these hib hydrogels were a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 349 able to heal either by heating or by surfactant treatment of the damage areas, recovering almost their initial strength (up to 1.5 mpa) and elongation (up to 600%) [106]. 2.5.3. polyampholytes (pa) gel pa gels belong to the physical hydrogels category as they are formed via non-covalent bonds between different charged monomers [107]. this supramolecular structure has multiple ionic bonds with a high disparity of strengths since the polymerization occurs randomly. the strong bonds act as permanent crosslinkers which are responsible for maintaining the original shape, while the weak bonds break upon loading enhancing their fracture energy as well as the self-healing capability by bond re-formation upon unloading. sun et al. obtained a pa gel structure (water content of 50–70 wt%) after mixing a anionic monomer, 3-(methacryloylamino)propyl-trimethylammonium chloride with a cationic monomer, sodium p-styrenesulphonate, in a aqueous solution containing a photoinitiator and nacl followed by uv-irradiation (fig. 1, pa) [107]. the electrostatic attractions between the polymer chains are more stable at high concentrations and near the charge balance, in order to prevent both phase separation and polymer collapse to a globule state [108,109]. the obtained hydrogels exhibit enhanced fracture stress and strain up to 1.8 mpa and 750%, respectively, a high toughness as shown by a fracture energy of 4000 j m2 and a complete recovery after loading until 600%. moreover, these hydrogels were also proved to have excellent biocompatibility using macrophages [107]. although pa structure only possess supramolecular bonds, they are mechanically tough contrarily to other self-healing hydrogels previously developed [99,110]. this toughness was associated with the presence of heterogeneous structure with randomly distributed strong and weak non-covalent bonds. 2.5.4. lamellar bilayer (lb) gel haque et al. reported a tough and anisotropic hydrophilic matrix containing multiple lipid bilayers with unidirectional alignment [111]. the rigid hydrophobic bilayers were composed of a polymerizable surfactant, dodecyl glyceryl itaconate (dgi) whereas the ductile polymeric network was made of polyacrylamide (paam) polymer (fig. 1, lb). the processing method consisted in the self-assembly of dgi monomers into stacked bilayers followed by the free radical polymerization of aam in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of dgi, n0,n0-methylenebis(acylamide) crosslinker and a photoinitiator. the lamellar structure was formed by applying a shear flow to the former precursor solution [112], resulting in an architecture composed of alternating polymer and lipid layers (water content higher than 90%) with a tensile fracture stress of 600 kpa parallel to the lipid bilayers direction. additionally, these hydrogels exhibit a high toughness, self-recovery and fatigue resistance. the previous characteristics arise from the presence of lamellar bilayers, which upon deformation consume a large amount of energy by dissociating themselves before the complete hydrogel fracture. the former fact together with their lipid-like movements are the main reasons behind the lb hydrogels superior mechanical properties [111]. 2.6. second network 2.6.1. double network (dn) gel double network (dn) hydrogels were first introduced by gong et al. in 2003 [41], being the result of combining two polymeric networks with contrasting physical structures and properties [113]. it is worth noting that contrarily to interpenetrating networks (ipns), which are also a combination of two structures, in dn networks the mechanical properties of the combined components are much higher when comparing with the two independent structures, showing a synergistic effect [41]. they are usually composed of a stiff and densely crosslinked (first brittle network) structure in dilute concentration and a ductile and loosely crosslinked (soft second network) structure in high concentration. to effectively improve the mechanical properties, the mass ratio of the second to the first network must be very high (usually 7–20 times that of the first network) in order to get strong dn hydrogels [41,114]. these structures are often synthesized via a two-step sequential free radical polymerization process: (1) the first step involves the formation of a highly crosslinked rigid gel and (2) the second forms a loosely crosslinked network inside the first gel structure. the first structure is often a polyelectrolyte in order to ensure both a high swelling rate and the effective entanglement of the second network within this first structure. this concept was proved to be general and independent of specific chemical interactions between the two networks [107,115]. to date, several tough hydrogels with different macromolecular designs based on dn methodology have been reported such as void-dn gels [116], inverse dn gels [117], liquid crystalline dn gels [118], microgel-reinforced hydrogels [119] and ultra-thin dn gels [120]. one of these tough hydrogels pairs consists of poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (pamps) as the first network and paam as the second structure. the obtained dn hydrogels (ca. 90% water content) exhibit a tensile fracture stress of 2 mpa, hardness with elastic modulus of 0.3 mpa and tearing energy of several thousands of j m2, which are comparable to or even higher than that of cartilage [114,121]. regarding their ability to sustain a compressive stress, they can hold a stress of 17.2 mpa for a strain of ca. 92%, which is much higher than their parents: pams gel break at 0.4 mpa for strain of 41% and paa gel at 0.8 mpa for 84%. upon deformation, the brittle network breaks into small clusters that efficiently disperse the stress around the crack tip into the surrounding damage zone, and thus imparts toughness to the dn gels. on the other side, the second ductile network extends extensively and, thereby, sustaining large deformations. in other words, the first network contributes to an increase on the elastic modulus, whereas the second structure is responsible for the increase on strain [114,115,122]. 350 a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 remarkably, the high-level of inhomogeneities of strong dn hydrogels is the origin of their superior toughness, which is also revealed in other tough biological tissues for instance, in bone, whose heterogeneous porous structure is known to reduce the stress concentrations [19]. 3. natural-origin tough hydrogels among all the polymers that can be used to create hydrogels, natural-origin polymers offer several advantages including their non-toxicity, biocompatibility, the presence of unique biological and chemical features and easiness to fabricate into hydrogels [53]. in fact, some of these polymers are components of native ecm, being responsible for different cell regulation processes spanning from migration to differentiation, and hence, suggesting their potential performance as soft tissues analogues [123,124]. furthermore, versatile chemical structures can be obtained by modifying the high number of functional groups present along their backbone, resulting in materials with improved characteristics for a specific application while retaining crucial biological features [125]. from the commercial point of view, natural-origin materials are often inexpensive as they are readily available from renewable sources [50–52]. despite the aforementioned extraordinary attributes, conventional natural-based hydrogels exhibit low strength, hindering their use in several load-bearing applications [126]. therefore, the strategies described in the former section were employed to create biopolymer-based hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties. such hydrogel systems combine high toughness and strength, obtained by employing the previous described methodologies, with the biocompatibility of natural polymers, whose association was only recently achieved. moreover, their potential for biomedical applications will be also addressed. 3.1. bacterial-cellulose and gelatin extracted from bacteria, bacterial cellulose (bc) consists in a hydrophobic stratified structure composed of alternating dense and sparse ultrafine fiber layers [127]. its structure (water content of ca. 90%) yields unique mechanical properties such as anisotropy, accompanying by a high tensile modulus (ca. 3 mpa) in the fiber-layer direction and low compressive modulus (ca. 0.007 mpa) perpendicular to the stratified layer. although bc hydrogel shows high mechanical properties as compared to other biopolymers, their structure do not recover after compression as result of hydrogen-bond formation between the cellulose fibers (fig. 2i, bc). in order to solve the previously stated drawback, gelatin was incorporated in the bc network, resulting in a bc/gelatin dn hydrogel. gelatin, a polypeptide derived from the denaturation of collagen, is mechanically brittle (compression strain of ca. 0.14 mpa and a compressive modulus of ca. 0.007 mpa), but it is able to sustain several repeated compression cycles without fracture (fig. 2i, gelatin). to synthesize this dn gel, bc was immersed in an aqueous solution containing gelatin that was further crosslinked using n-(3-dimethy-laminopropyl)-n0-ethylcarbodi imede hydrochloride. the combinatorial effect of these two mechanically contrasting structures (hard bc network and soft gelatin structure) resulted in a 3d network able to simultaneously bear a compression stress of ca. 3.7 mpa and recover its original shape after a second compressive deformation up to 30% of strain (fig. 2i, bc/gelatin and 2iia). regarding their tensile properties, bc/gelatin hydrogel exhibit an impressive elastic modulus and stress of ca. 23 mpa and ca. 3 mpa, respectively (fig. 2iib). other polysaccharides such as alginate, gellan-gum and carrageenan were also used to produce dn networks in combination with bc [128]. the resultant mechanical properties of these dn networks are comparable with that of the cartilage, however, the ultimate stress of the bc/gelatin dn hydrogels dramatically decreased after 6 weeks implantation into the subcutaneous tissue of rabbit [129]. the former fact severally hinders their potential application as an artificial substitute of load-bearing soft tissues. additionally, due to the use of toxic crosslinkers, this device may not be a good candidate for cell encapsulation purposes. 3.2. gellan-gum and gelatin the synthetic conditions for dn formation are often incompatible with cell viability due to the use of toxic solvents or/and crosslinkers as well as harsh processing conditions. with the aim of encapsulating cells, dn hydrogels composed of a stiff gellan gum methacrylate (ggma) and a soft gelatin methacrylamide (gelma) structures were synthesized [130]. gg is an anionic polysaccharide extracted from the bacterium sphingomonas elodea [131], being composed of a tetrasaccharide repeating unit of b-d-glucose; b-d-glucuronic acid and a-l-rhamnose. this biopolymer is able to form a gel network by changing their chains conformation from disordered coils to double helices upon cooling, followed by their aggregation through ionic crosslinks in the presence of mono- or divalent cations [132,133]. the ggma/gelma dn hydrogels were produced through a two-step photocrosslinking process by immersing ggma hydrogel, which was obtained after uv-exposure for 120 s in presence of a photoinitiator, in a gelma precursor solution. after the gelma diffusion into the first network a second photocrosslinking process was performed to yield the second network. the resulting dn hydrogels reached a maximum compressive failure stress of ca. 6.9 mpa for a failure strain of 81%. this remarkable behavior may be explained by the presence of the stiff network (ggma) which is responsible for sustaining the applied stress while the soft network dissipates the crack energy avoiding the construct breakdown [134]. moreover, nih-3t3 fibroblasts were successfully encapsulated in the ggma/gelma by suspending these cells in the ggma precursor solution, which was after crosslinked by uv-light exposure [130]. afterward, the cell-loaded ggma hydrogels were placed inside a gelma precursor solution followed by a second a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 351 photocrosslinking process. after 3 days of cell incubation at physiological conditions, it was possible to verify that most of the cells survive within the dn hydrogel matrix as shown by live/dead assay images (fig. 3i), proving the cell-compatibility character of the developed strategy to engineer tough hydrogels for biomedical purposes [130]. irrespective of the high toughness and strength of the previous dn hydrogels, they do not recover after a loading cycle as result of the irreversible covalent-based crosslinking (permanent damage). bakarich et al. designed and fabricated a tough hydrogel with the ability to recover from large strain by mixing hot solutions of gg with acrylamide (aam) monomers, which were then crosslinked through the addition of ca2+ and n,n0-methylenebisacrylamide (mbaam), respectively, in the presence of n,n,n0,n0-tetramethylethylenediamine (temed) and kps [135]. therefore, the gg/paam hydrogels (water content higher than 95%) were composed by an ionically crosslinked gg and a covalently crosslinked paam network, which can withstand ca. 216 kpa in compression (2 and 13 times more stress than the corresponding gg and paam single networks, respectively). although this value is much lower than the previous, the fact that these hydrogels present ionic crosslinks which are weaker allow their elastic recovery under ambient conditions [136]. in addition, gg/paam hydrogels were subjected to several load/unload compression cycles. although they can only recover 53 ± 4% after the first compressive cycle they are able to recover 90 ± 9% after the subsequent cycles, which is much better than the conventional dn hydrogels [114]. recently, the previous process was further polished to attain strong and self-healing hydrogels by using a one-pot synthesis method [137]. to this end, hot aqueous solution of gg was combined with gelatin and, subsequently, crosslinked by the action of ca2+ and genipin, non-cytotoxic crosslinker [138], respectively. these structures containing both ionic (between gg polymer and ca2+ ions) and covalent (between gelatin and genipin) crosslinking mechanisms exhibited a maximum fracture stress of 1.0 mpa and 0.62 mpa in compression and tension, respectively (fig. 3iia). regarding their recoverability, gg/gelatin dn hydrogels were compressed until a stress of 150 kpa and then allowed to rest in both air or immersed in simulated body fluid (sbf) (fig. 3iib and iic). the results revealed that by placing the hydrogels in sbf for time intervals higher than 10 min leads to a recovery of the initial mechanical properties, especially regarding the hysteresis (95 ± 2%), suggesting that these gels were not permanently damaged by the first loading/unloading cycle [137]. in addition, the mmc concept has also employed to create microgel-reinforced ggma/gelma hydrogels [139], showing better mechanical and biological properties over the dn hydrogels using the same biopolymers [130]. briefly, ggma fig. 2. i. photographs

uv-radiation for 120 s. the resulting ggma hydrogels were incorporated in gelma matrix after a second photocrosslinking process for 180 s (fig. 3iii). regarding their mechanical properties, mmc hydrogels were able to withstand a maximum strength of ca. 3.2 mpa, which was higher when comparing with the corresponding ggma/gelma dn structure (ca. 1.5 mpa). this behavior was explained by the higher ggma concentration on mmc gels, enhancing their strength. contrarily, on dn hydrogels the ratio of ggma to gelma is critical to attain the optimized mechanical properties and hence, this component should be prepared at relatively low polymer concentration. additionally, the ggma microgels protect the gelma matrix from fracture by allowing the crack grow in their structures, which due to the microgels dispersion on the gelma structure avoids the crack propagation into macroscopic ones [119]. concerning the biological properties, higher viability rates were observed in mmc hydrogels since the cells were encapsulated in gelma instead of ggma, which present many adhesion sites and hence is recognized as great material for cell encapsulation [140]. on dn hydrogels, cells were firstly encapsulated in a ggma matrix, and hence their contact with gelatin may be hindered, which may explain the lower viability rates when comparing with the mmc hydrogels. fig. 3. i. live/dead

353 furthermore, alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity and the amount of mineralization revealed the osteogenic behavior of mc3t3-e1 cells when encapsulated on the ggma/gelma mmc hydrogels. interestingly, the gelma precursor solution containing ggma microgels can be possibly injected followed by in situ photocrosslinking, after the assessment of the light penetration ability [139]. 3.3. chitin chitin is the second most available polymer in nature being mainly obtained from crustaceans [141]. this biopolymer present some interesting features for biomedical applications such as biocompatibility, antibacterial character and nontoxicity. due to its inherently poor mechanical behavior, chitin have been mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva), a synthetic and biocompatible polymer [142], with the aim of creating a tough hydrogel structure [143]. these hydrogels were obtained by first dissolving chitin in naoh/urea aqueous solution containing the pva polymer followed by crosslinking with epichlorohydrin (ech). moreover, to form pva crystals and physically crosslink this synthetic material, a freezing-thawing method was employed [142,144]. the resultant chitin/pva hydrogel composite is composed by two crosslinking mechanisms, namely (1) a chemical (between chitin and ech) and (2) a physical (hydrogen bonds between pva and chitin chains). additionally, pva intermolecular interactions can lead to the formation of crystallites which, in turn, can ensure a higher stability of the hydrogel. interestingly, the morphology of the obtained hydrogels containing 25% of pva was found to be very similar to the one of the jellyfish (fig. 4i shows a non-ordered chitin/pva structure while fig. 4ii displays an ordered layered structure) [144]. the obtained ordered and layered porous structure, in which the hydrophilic pva crystals are tightly immobilized on the chitin backbone matrix through the presence of hydrogen bonds, was ascribed to the performed freezing/ thawing cycles. moreover, during the freezing/thawing cycles a microphase separation between the formed crystalline ice and pva crystals can also explain the obtained ordered structure. in fact, these hydrogels containing a jelly-fish like architecture were found to result in higher mechanical properties (compressive strength of 2.1 mpa and strain at break of 80%, fig. 4iii) than other hybrid gels containing different amounts of pva polymer and also when comparing with pure chitin. the former fact have been related with the effective dispersion of the stress by multilayered structures, and hence, higher external stresses are needed in order to break this well-defined structure [145]. additionally, these chitin/pva hydrogels were proved to be cytocompatible after both l929 fibroblasts and mdkc cells seeding on its surface [143]. the combination of the aforementioned characteristics, namely their cytocompatibility, high mechanical properties and well-defined structure, highlights chitin/pva hydrogel potential as an artificial substitute of load-bearing soft tissues. however, their use for cell encapsulation purposes may be compromised by the need for toxic reagents and harsh processing conditions, such as the freezing–thawing cycles. 3.4. alginate one of the most used biomaterials is alginate due to its gelling properties in mild conditions [146]. this neutral polysaccharide is mainly obtained from brown algae and is composed of (1?4)-linked b-d-mannuronic acid and a-l-guluronic acid residues [33,147]. these monomers are organized in blocks rich in mannuronic acid, blocks rich in guluronic acid units and blocks rich in both units. the gelling process occurs through interactions between the carboxylic acid moieties and bivalent counter ions such as calcium [136,148]. sun et al. developed a highly stretchable hybrid hydrogel composed of two crosslinked polymer networks: an ionically crosslinked alginate through the presence of ca2+ and a covalently crosslinked paam using mbaam as crosslinker. the introduction of a non-covalent crosslinking mechanism allowed this hydrogel to recover upon unloading, which is not possible in conventional dn hydrogels. during deformation, the alginate network fig. 4. i. photographs depicting the fesem results of the cross-sections for the resultant chitin/poly(vinyl alcohol) (rcp)

chemical/physical crosslinking rcp75 structure. iii. typical compressive stress–strain curve of the rcp for different weight percentages of chitin (from 0% to 100 wt%) by fixing the total polymer

unzipping its ionic crosslinks while the paam structure preserve its mechanical integrity. after unloading, the reversible ionic bonds can be reformed. these hybrid hydrogels with ca. 90% of water in their composition presented a tensile fracture stress, elongation and energy of 156 kpa, 20 times their initial length, and 9000 j m2, respectively. this outstanding fracture energy is much higher than the one of conventional hydrogels and have been ascribed to the energy dissipation occurring upon the unzip of the alginate chains [71]. in vivo results obtained upon implantation of these structures into dorsal subcutaneous pockets in rats suggested a minimal inflammatory response by the absence of macrophages and lymphocytes infiltration after 8 weeks, highlighting their potential for biomedical applications [149]. although the alginate/paam hydrogels exhibited an outstanding toughness, they have a relatively low stiffness, which is mainly due to the alginate low concentration (further increase is hindered by the high viscosity of the final solution) and crosslinking density (calcium sulfate crosslinker has poor solubility in water). realizing this difficulty, li et al. introduced a hybrid alginate/paam hydrogel with both high stiffness and toughness by increasing both of the aforementioned aspects. while the alginate concentration was increased using alginate with different molecular weights, the crosslinking density was improved through the combination of calcium sulfate and calcium chloride (fig. 5ia) [150]. the results suggested that by increasing the amount of low molecular weight alginate while fixing the total alginate concentration, the stiffness remained constant (ca. 1 mpa) whereas the toughness increased, reaching the remarkable fracture energy of ca. 16 kj m2 (fig. 5ib). this phenomenon was related with the decrease of strength upon increasing the fraction of short-chains, resulting in the growing of the region near the crack tip where the energy is dissipated, which, in turn, increases the toughness [150]. alginate containing phenylboronic acid (pba) was combined with pva to yield a supramolecular hydrogel with both shape memory and self-healing ability (fig. 5iia) [151]. on the one hand, the shape memory properties were conferred by the presence of ionic crosslinks between alginate and ca2+, which can retain the temporary shape (100%), and then, recover to the permanent shape by extracting these cations using na2co3 (recovery ratio of ca. 100%) or edta (recovery ratio of ca. 92%) (fig. 5iib). on the other hand, the presence of supramolecular bonds, in particular, through the reversible pba-diol ester bond interaction between pba groups of alginate-pba and the pva hydroxyl groups, is responsible for the self-recovery ability. this recoverability was demonstrated by pressing tightly freshly cut pieces of this hydrogel as shown in fig. 5iic [151]. fig. 5. i.

seaweeds, is able to form a hydrogel network by a thermoreversible sol–gel transition upon cooling to 30–40 c [152]. a one-pot methodology was introduce by chen et al. to replace the conventional time-consuming dn multi-step polymerization process through the simultaneous mixing of agar, aam monomers, initiators and chemical crosslinkers at 90– 95 c followed by cooling the precursor solution to physically crosslink agar. the second paam structure is formed within the agarose structure after uv-light irradiation. agar/paam dn hydrogels were tough with a compression modulus, stress and strain of 123 kpa, 38 mpa and 98%, respectively. moreover, these dn hydrogels were able to recover their initial shape after being subjected to several types of deformation such as bending (fig. 6ia), knotting (fig. 6ib), compression (fig. 6ic) and elongation (fig. 6id), and also showed the ability to be synthesized with any shape (fig. 6ie–g). interestingly, the network of agar/paam hydrogels can be recovered taking advantage of the agar thermoreversible nature as observed by the hysteresis loop recovery after 10 min at 100 c (above the agar melting point; fig. 6iia), which has not observed at 50 c (below the agar melting point; fig. 6iib). therefore, these hydrogels combine superior mechanical properties and recoverability capabilities, highlighting their potential as load-bearing artificial soft tissues analogues. however, these agar/paam hydrogels may not be suitable for cell encapsulation purposes due to the presence of toxic aam monomers. 3.6. carrageenan tough and recoverable hydrogels were produced from carrageenan using dn-based method [154]. carrageenan, a partially sulfated polysaccharide obtained from red seaweeds, is composed by b-d-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-a-d-galactose units [51]. according with the degree of sulfation, three kinds of carrageenan can be obtained, namely, kappa-carrageenan (kc) with one sulfate per disaccharide, iota-carrageenan (ic) with two sulfates per disaccharide and lambda-carrageenan (lc) which is highly sulfated [51]. kc and ic polymers form hydrogels through ionic crosslinks between cations and double helix units, which are formed by changing the temperature. these two derivatives of carrageenan biopolymer were used to produce kc/paam dn hydrogels and ic/paam dn by mixing kc or ic polymers with aam monomer in water containing kps and mbaam at 70 c followed by cooling down to 25 c. consequently, this hydrogel combines an ionic carrageenan network with a covalent paam network, which

(2015) 344–364 compression (ca. 9.9 mpa and 4.0 mpa for kc and ic, respectively) and tension (ca. 75 kpa and 107 kpa for kc and ic, respectively) (fig. 7ia and ib). the improved mechanical properties of ic/paam dn hydrogels (compression, elongation, bending, knotting) can be observed in fig. 7iia–e. while kc/paam dn hydrogels presented a higher modulus (40.8 kpa), the ic is tougher (fracture energy of 9500 j m2). a quick recover ability was easily observed by forcing the hydrogel to pass through a buttonhole (fig. 7ii). this mechanical behavior is the result of the presence of carrageenan ionic bonds, which are firstly broken upon loading, bridging the main paam backbone structure, which, in turn, is responsible for maintaining the hydrogel structure. interestingly, these dn hydrogels were able to heal from their cracks at mild temperatures, by the reestablishment of the broken supramolecular bonds. as described for the agar/paam hydrogels, the presence of aam monomers may hamper their use as cell-laden devices. 3.7. hyaluronan hyaluronan (ha) is a natural occurring glycosaminoglycan, being abundant in connective, epithelial and neural tissues. its structure has d-glucuronic acid and d-n-acetylglucosamine units linked together via alternating b-1,4-and b-1,3 glycosidic bonds [155]. as this polysaccharide is part of the ecm, it is promisor for applications where one intends to mimic such extracellular environment [156]. interpenetrated networks containing ha have been proposed [157] but efforts have been recently done to develop hydrogels with improved mechanical behavior based on the dn strategy. a first network made of methacrylate ha (pha), a photocrosslinkable derivative of ha polymer, was prepared by uv irradiation for 2 h in presence of a photoinitiator. then, the resulting covalently crosslinked structure was immersed in a solution containing n,n-dimethylacrylamide (daam) monomers. after reaching the equilibrium, the second polymeric network was formed by uv exposure for 2 h in presence of mbaam crosslinker and a photoinitiator, yielding a pha/pdaam dn hydrogel. even though these hydrogels are mostly composed of water (more than 90%), the mechanical assays revealed a fracture stress fig. 7. i. typical compression (a) and tensile (b) stress–strain curves of poly(acrylamide) (paam), iota-carrageenan (ic)/paam dn hydrogel and

european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 357 as high as 5.2 mpa for a strain of 87.1% and compressive moduli of 0.1 mpa, which is much higher than pure pha hydrogel (fracture stress, strain and compressive modulus of 0.29 mpa, 56.1% and 0.045 mpa, respectively). these properties resulted from the combination of a stiff but brittle ha network and one soft but ductile pdaam network. these dn-based hydrogels can effectively dissipate the stress imposed during compression by either deforming the network conformation and/or sliding the physical entanglements points along the polymer chains. additionally, these robust hydrogels were shown to be non-cytotoxic and resistant to fibroblast cells degradation after 2 months of cell culture [158]. the previous characteristics combined with the superior mechanical behavior allow their potential application as replacers of load bearing tissues. 3.8. chondroitin sulfate other biopolymer that is also found in the ecm of biological tissues, is chondroitin sulfate, being responsible for providing ecm strength. chondroitin sulfate constitutes a sulfated polysaccharide made of both n-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid sugars. recently, a novel method was developed to produce tough dn gel combining a neutral and biocompatible polymer with any polyelectrolyte biopolymer [159]. in this work, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate were used as molecular stents and were combined with a neutral pdaam polymer. to this end, the biopolymer was added to an aqueous solution containing the neutral monomer followed by its polymerization into a first pdaam network. since the biopolymer (polyelectrolyte) is physically trapped within the first polymer network, this structure is able to swell allowing the incorporation of a second neutral monomer needed to create a tough dn hydrogel. as can be observed in fig. 8, only the incorporation of biopolymers in the first neutral structure do not contribute to the increase of fig. 8. i. tensile stress–strain curves of single-network gels (a) and double-network gels (b) without biopolymers (red) and with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans

344–364 the overall mechanical properties (fig. 8ia); however, the incorporation of a second matrix within the first one resulted in hydrogels with extraordinary mechanical properties (fig. 8ib). moreover, the potential of using biopolymers to increase the biological activity was assessed by seeding hcaes above the dn hydrogels with or without biopolymers. the results revealed a cell spherical-like shape on the sample without molecular stents (fig. 8iia) whereas cells showed their typical spindle shape in the presence of the biopolymer (fig. 8iib). the described strategy combines the strength and toughness of dn hydrogels with the bioactivity of biopolymers, enhancing their potential as soft tissues analogues. moreover, this methodology is general in the sense that allows the introduction of any biopolymers without chemical modification and any neutral polymer [159]. 4. final remarks and future trends as result of the high prevalence of degenerative diseases commonly suffered by old people, and the frequent occurrence of injuries in athletes, tissue repair have been highlighted as a hot research topic for some years now [160]. early procedures for the treatment of these lesions explored the transplantation of organs or tissues to the site of injury; however, this practice presents collateral effects such as the possible damage of the donor site, disease transmission and recipient rejection as well as shortage of donors [161,162]. consequently, new alternatives to grafts and artificial hard and dry substitutes are nowadays explored for repairing soft tissues, for instance, the promising te technique. generally speaking, te approaches aim at developing materials that can induce and guide cell proliferation, differentiation, and new tissue formation at the site of tissue injury or defect [126]. accordingly, recapitulating the characteristic found in native ecm such as solutes permeability, high strength, large deformation, biocompatibility and bioactivity is likely to be the most favorable strategy to create scaffold-based te [37,163]. notably, hydrogels provide a highly hydrated microenvironment similar to the native ecm, and hence, they have been pointed as prospective candidates for tissue repair [33,164]. as compared with other class of materials such as metals and ceramics, hydrogels exhibit the lowest rigidity, which is comparable with the one found in native soft tissues [10]. this softness constitutes a crucial aspect to consider when designing a biomaterial to mimic the ecm since it minimizes the irritation of the surrounding tissues [39]. however, regarding the toughness and strength, a large difference between natural tissues and biomaterials arises [165] as conventional hydrogels are often brittle with fracture energies lower than 10 j m2, which are far from the 1000 j m2 of cartilage [166]. recent advances in gel science were made through the development of a plethora of approaches to create customizable 3d polymeric network with superior mechanical properties. these strategies are based on the incorporation of different entities into a hydrogel structure, for instance, nc and mmc hydrogels have multifunctional crosslinkers to effectively diminish the structural inhomogeneity [43,101]; tp hydrogels present sliding crosslinks whose position on the polymeric network can be adjusted to cooperatively sustain the strain [42]; tetra-peg, ccb, pa hydrogels are the result of combining different monomers with different functional groups to create strong structures [82,91,107]; lb hydrogels have lamellar bilayers to provide high toughness and self-healing ability [111]; dn hydrogels are based on the introduction of a second polymeric matrix which consequently increase the fracture stress and toughness [41]. therefore, the brittleness of conventional hydrogels can be suppressed by changing their network structure, which consists in randomly interconnected chains made from single polymers. homogeneous hydrogels prevent the crack progression through the decrease of the strand length distribution, and consequently, the stress can be equally sustained by all the strands. contrarily, heterogeneous hydrogels suggest that heterogeneity is desirable considering that their toughening method depends on multiple random fractures. moreover, the toughness of a material can be severely enhanced by introducing energy-dissipation methods. several recent works have replaced the irreversible covalent bonds by supramolecular ones, for instance, hydrophobic associations [74,104,106], ionic crosslinks [103,107] and hydrogen bonds [73]. all of these methods constitute new concepts which can be applied to create strong, tough and endurable devices. the choice of the most suitable strategy will rely on the required properties for a specific application. for instance, if high elongations and low stiffness are needed (>8 times the original length) homogeneous hydrogels could be used such as sr gels. besides the previous characteristics, dn hydrogels possesses also a high toughness, which may also be a requisite for a particular purpose. however, if stiffness is crucial, l-nc should be preferentially selected at the expense of lower strength values. furthermore, a combination of the different strategies should also be envisaged as this would result in hydrogels with improved mechanical properties [167–169]. a recent theme that has attracted much attention in the biomaterials field is the fabrication of tough hydrogels for many load-bearing biomedical applications [113]. in this sense, biocompatibility is fundamental and can be achieved through the construction of biopolymer-based hydrogels [126]. taking advantage of the previously stated methodologies to synthesize strong and tough hydrogels, researchers have engineered a variety of systems to meet the complex biological and mechanical requirements of te. undoubtedly, among all the methods, the dn approach affords the highest versatility in terms of composition and resulting properties, and therefore, it has been extensively employed by combining, for instance, bacterial-cellulose with gelatin, alginate, carrageenan or gellan-gum [128]; gellan-gum derivatives with gelatin [137,139] or poly(acrylamide) [135,139]; chitin with poly(vinyl alcohol) [143]; alginate derivatives with poly(vinyl alcohol) [151] or poly(acrylamide) [71,150]; agar with poly(acrylamide) [153]; carrageenan with poly(acrylamide) [154]; acid hyaluronic derivatives with poly(dimethylacrylamide) [167]; and chondroitin sulfate with poly(acrylamide) [159], resulting in structures with improved strength and toughness which is of outmost importance for tissue repair. more hydrogels systems were already developed combining other natural-origin materials [140,170]. a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 359 hydrogel scientists may also use some hints found in nature occurring hydrogels to design structural materials with superior mechanical properties [171]. some animals like jellyfish and sea cucumber are examples of 3d networks with high water content, which exhibit a high tensile and compressive moduli [143,172]. these exceptional features found in biological tissues are mainly due to the presence of a sophisticated architecture from more than one type of molecule [173]. in particular, ecm can be conceived as a crosslinked matrix with a well-ordered structure on various length scales made of proteins such as collagen or elastin intertwined with high molecular weight molecules such as some polysaccharides (including hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate) [174]. having this in mind, the control of the hydrogel microstructure would potentially yield artificial substitutes of native tissues with outstanding mechanical performances [172,175]. in this review some of the attempted approaches to recapture the ecm structure were described, showing impressive mechanical properties when comparing with non-order structures made of the same materials [98,111,143]. these unique microstructures are able to effectively distribute the applied load over a wide area, slowing down the crack propagation and therefore, avoid the material fracture [145]. however, the reconstruction of the biotissues structure is extremely daunting [163]. realizing this difficulty, wang et al. proposed a peculiar way of preserving this natural feature by incorporating paam or paa polymers into a fresh jellyfish (jf) gel, which is mainly composed of collagen and water (ca. 99 wt% after salt extraction) with layered structure [145]. interestingly, only the native jf gel structure was able to withstand 1.16 mpa in compression and 21.3 kpa in tension, which is higher when comparing with conventional hydrogels. the incorporation of the paam and paa polymers into the jellyfish gel resulted in hydrogels with strengths several tens times higher than those of jf and the corresponding paam or paa structures [145], proving the importance of a well-defined microstructure to obtain hydrogels with superior mechanical properties. in addition, this defined organization may have beneficial biological features, for instance, by promoting cell infiltration and neovascularization [176,177]. this knowledge open a new venue for the creation of materials with diverse functions simply by replacing non-ordered structure by a well-developed microstructure, instead of selecting a new material. although this review mainly focus on the hydrogels mechanical properties and biocompatibility, other aspects should also be considered to achieve the ultimate goal of te. besides providing an initial support for cell adhesion and proliferation, 3d artificial matrices should reproduce relevant native biochemical and biophysical microenvironments to pave a way toward the engineering of functional tissues [177]. several studies demonstrated that the incorporation of bioclues (e.g. cell-binding motifs) and/or biological factors (e.g. growth factors) are crucial to ensure the cell viability and proliferation inasmuch as they constitute instructive microenvironment molecules to improve the cell/matrix interaction [52,176,178,179]. one research area, less studied in the past few years, is the design and construction of tough hydrogels with controlled degradation behavior. this degradability could be virtually introduced by labile bonds either on the polymer backbone or on the crosslinkers used to create the hydrogels, which can be later enzymatical or chemically broken under physiological conditions. moreover, this degradation should be tailored and the degradation products should be non-cytotoxic [76]. more recent approaches are also exploring non-invasive and patient-friendly procedures involving the targeted administration of therapeutic molecules, such as growth factors, within materials mimicking the mechanical and biological conditions of the site to be treated [180]. in this sense, loaded injectable polymeric precursors able to self-assemble or crosslink into strong and biocompatible 3d networks after their injection, should also be developed. therefore, it is anticipated that hydrogels with high toughness, strength, recoverability, a well-defined architecture, biocompatibility and bioactivity will certainly enhance the applicability of these polymeric networks in the biomedical field [120,181]. however, the current state of research in this area is mainly focused on the improvement of the physicochemical properties of hydrogels and less on recapturing all the native ecm environment, and hence, must go further to significantly improve the applications of hydrogels in diverse areas. the concepts and techniques summarized in this review to enhance the mechanical properties of conventional hydrogels are very promising for load-bearing applications. in particular, advanced strategies that combine simultaneously superior mechanical properties and biocompatibility of hydrogels are expected to expand the range of application to the tissue engineering field. we believe that this review will serve as guide in future development of natural-origin hydrogels for biomedical applications, especially as cell-laden analogues of load-bearing soft tissues and ecm artificial substitutes. acknowledgements a.m.s.c. thanks fct (fundação para a ciência e a tecnologia) for financial support through phd grant sfrh/bd/101748/2014.

keywords: natural polymers self-healing soft tissues tough and strong hydrogels well-defined architectures a b s t r a c t ideal candidates for the repair of robust biological tissues should exhibit diverse features such as biocompatibility, strength, toughness, self-healing ability and a well-defined structure. among the available biomaterials, hydrogels, as highly hydrated 3d-crosslinked polymeric networks, are promising for tissue engineering purposes as result of their high resemblance with native extracellular matrix. however, these polymeric structures often exhibit a poor mechanical behavior, hampering their use in load-bearing applications. during the last years, several efforts have been made to create new strategies and concepts to fabricate strong and tough hydrogels. although it is already possible to shape the mechanical properties of artificial hydrogels to mimic biotissues, critical issues regarding, for instance, their biocompatibility and hierarchical structure are often neglected. therefore, this review covers the structural and mechanical characteristics of the developed methodologies to toughen hydrogels, highlighting some pioneering efforts employed to combine the aforementioned properties in natural-based hydrogels.  2015 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. contents 1. introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

strength), fracture resistance (i.e. toughness) and softness (i.e. low modulus) [1]. for instance, cartilage, which contains about 75 wt% of water, is able to undertake a remarkable compressive stress of several mpa [2] without fracture, exhibits a toughness of more than 1000 j m2 and a nominal compressive modulus of 0.1–1.0 mpa [3]. this extraordinary mechanical behavior have been ascribed to a plethora of molecular and structural events occurring in biological tissues [4]. an optimal device for the repair of robust biological soft tissues either based on regeneration or replacement strategies should meet several criteria such as, (i) strength to sustain the applied force, (ii) biocompatibility resorting, for instance, to natural polymers, (iii) a well-defined structure from the molecular to the macroscopic levels and (iv) recoverability to reversibly deform without fracture [1,5–8]. in the last years, many groups have been focusing their efforts in order to create these multifunctional systems combining the aforementioned properties [9]. one class of such materials are hydrogels, which consist of three-dimensional solid networks made from crosslinked hydrophilic polymer chains [10]. owing to their outstanding characteristics such as water absorption and retention ability, biocompatibility and tunable physical, chemical and biological properties, these polymeric networks are excellent candidates for a broad range of biomedical applications [11], which include scaffolds for tissue engineering (te) [12–14], carriers for drug delivery [11,15–18], molecular filters in biological science [19–21], superabsorbent devices in disposable diapers [22] and valves for microfluidics [23–25]. furthermore, when exposed to an environmental signal such as temperature and ph, some sensitive hydrogels are able to respond and translate this stimulus into a macroscopic event, allowing their application as sensors and/or actuators and smart drug release devices [9,26–32]. but, perhaps, the most interesting feature about these 3d networks is their high resemblance, in terms of structure and physical properties, with the native extracellular matrix (ecm), highlighting their potential for te and biomedical purposes [11,33–37]. however, their use in stress-bearing applications is often hindered since hydrogels, when highly swollen, often lack of mechanical properties such as strength, toughness, elongation and recoverability [20,38,39]. this poor mechanical performance is in high contrast with native structural hydrogels such as cartilage and may result in unintended failure in vivo [40]. considering the aforementioned drawback, hydrogels were classified as mechanical weak materials, and hence, little attention was paid to them as artificial substitutes of load-bearing soft tissues. nevertheless, in the last few years, new strategies and concepts have been developed to toughen hydrogels including double networks [41], topological [42] and nanocomposite hydrogels [43]; allowing the application of these 3d structures, for instance, as artificial substitutes of native tissues with structural properties similar to hydrogels such as skin [44], heart valves [45], spinal disks [46], cartilage [8], muscles and nerves [47,48]. in particular, natural-origin polymers are good candidates for biomedical applications as a result of their biocompatibility [49], low cost and easiness to process into hydrogels [50]. although the chemical structure of synthetic polymers is easily controlled when comparing with natural polymers, they often lack of cell-signaling and cell-interactive motifs which are difficult to mimic in laboratory and are extremely important for the material integration with the surrounding tissues [51,52]. several natural-based polymers have been investigated for this purpose [53] including proteins such as collagen [54] and gelatin [55]; and polysaccharides such as cellulose [56], chitosan [57], hyaluronan [58] and chondroitin sulfate [59]. however, the brittleness of these hydrogels is in great contrast with the toughness of biological tissues, showing fracture energies of about 0.1–10 j m2 [60,61], tensile moduli ranging from 10 to 104 pa [62] and compressive fracture stresses lower a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 345 than 1 mpa [63]. consequently, many efforts have been done in order to apply the previously stated methods to create tough structures made of natural polymers for load-bearing biomedical applications. from all the available materials in nature, polymers are the main constitutes of living organisms and, remarkably, biotissues exhibit a huge variety of functionalities [4]. this diversity has been ascribed to the tissues well-defined and complex structuring and, in this regard, the control over the hydrogel structure at all levels of hierarchy is also crucially important for the construction of biotissues substitutes [64–66]. another critical point that should be addressed during the design of artificial structural biomaterials is the material self-healing ability, which contributes to the development of longer-lasting products. self-repairing, which is the ability of materials to heal from their cracks, is found in biological materials such as in bones [67], wood [68] and skin [69]. this property is often achieved by a dynamic bond breaking/reforming upon deformation, which protects the material backbone from macroscopic fracture [4,70]. this nature inspired feature can be mimicked by replacing irreversible covalent crosslinks by non-covalent ones, which often result in the overall increase of hydrogels’ toughness [70]. hydrogels with self-healing properties have been synthesized using different reversible interactions, for instance, electrostatic [71], hydrogen [72,73] and hydrophobic [74]. this review covers the recent advances done to produce artificial soft tissues with the aforementioned characteristics. first, some pioneering work to fabricate hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties will be described, highlighting the design concept employed and their network structure as well as the mechanism behind their outstanding toughness. although hydrogels synthesized through these strategies exhibit superior mechanical properties, in most cases, not enough attention was paid on the biocompatibility, self-healing and their macro/micro-structure. therefore, it will then focus on some natural-origin tough hydrogels produced employing the previous methodologies and their attempt to be applied as substitutes of biological tissues. throughout this review, particular emphasis will be done on tough hydrogels devices with a well-defined architecture and self-healing properties. 2. hydrogels with reinforced mechanical properties hydrogels are stable in aqueous solutions by virtue of crosslinking points, which can be formed either by a covalent or non-covalent mechanism, and thus, yielding chemical or physical hydrogels, respectively. while chemical hydrogels can be produced by radical polymerization, energy irradiation, chemical reactions between complementary groups and/or enzymatic crosslinking; physical networks are often the result of changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and ph, molecular entanglements and/or supramolecular interactions [75,76]. on the one hand, physical hydrogels generally have the advantages of gel formation under mild conditions and avoiding the use of organic solvents. on the other hand, chemical hydrogels have often higher mechanical properties but need toxic crosslinkers and/or solvents [19]. generally speaking, the mechanical properties of hydrogels arise mainly from two aspects: the intrinsic rigidity of the polymer chains and the crosslinking density [33]. although their mechanical strength can be slightly enhanced by increasing the polymer concentration or the crosslinking density, single network hydrogels often lack of mechanical properties [77]. this inherent poor mechanical behavior is the result of various factors such as the (i) irregular distribution of crosslinking points per unit volume (crosslinking density), (ii) different polymer chains length between the crosslinking points (inter-crosslinking molecular weight) [78,79], (iii) high water content [80] and/or (iv) lack of energy-dissipation mechanisms to prevent the crack propagation [9]. structure inhomogeneity, which results from the random aggregation of crosslinking points, occurs typically during the hydrogel formation. the former phenomenon is due to the differences in reactivity between the monomer and the crosslinker as more densely crosslinked regions are initially formed and later connected by large chains [81]. moreover, when using crosslinking agents, it is difficult to ensure that the crosslinking process will occur at regularly separated positions, resulting in a broad distribution on the chains length. accordingly, upon loading, the stress cannot be evenly distributed on the hydrogels chains and they start to break from the weakest link, reducing the overall mechanical properties [82,83]. concerning the amount of water uptake, it is known that high water contents result in the reduction of the crosslinking density, which in turn, reduces the fracture energy as fewer chains are needed to be broken in order for the crack to propagate. additionally, energy-dissipation mechanisms, for instance, through crystallization or viscoelastic energy dissipation are also reduced by the separation of network chains in swollen hydrogels [84]. hence, substantial efforts have been done to design and fabricate strong hydrogel structures. while some of the research groups focus their work in creating homogeneous structures, others take advantage of their heterogeneity. the careful synthesis of networks with a narrow inter-crosslinking molecular weight results in hydrogels with superior mechanical properties when comparing with their equivalent heterogeneous networks, because the applied load can be evenly distributed over their chains [85]. contrarily, there are some studies suggesting that an optimization of the structural inhomogeneity rather than its removal, leads to a drastic improvement on the mechanical properties [19]. in this section, we will present some of the developed approaches to prepare tough and strong hydrogels. although most of the concepts presented here are not suitable for cell encapsulation purposes due to their harsh processing conditions, these hydrogel systems are prospective candidates as artificial substitutes of load-bearing soft tissues owing to their enhanced mechanical behavior. these outstanding mechanical properties are the result of the incorporation of several entities in the hydrogel structure, namely: 346 a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 2.1. functional end groups 2.1.1. tetra-poly(ethylene)glycol (tetra-peg) gel solving the inherent inhomogeneity of conventional hydrogels, sakai et al. reported a method to fabricate strong and homogeneous polymeric networks by mixing two symmetrical tetrahedron-like macromonomers of the same size [82]. each monomer consisted in a four-arm poly ethylene glycol (peg) macromer with a tetrahedron-like structure differing on the functional terminal group; either an amine or succinimidyl ester (fig. 1, tetra-peg gel) [82]. a uniform 3d-network structure, with negligible topological defects such as entanglements [86], was obtained through the formation of amide bonds between the terminal groups when the stoichiometric ratio between the two macromonomers was unitary [87]. these gels exhibit a maximum compression stress and modulus of ca. 2.5 mpa and 40 kpa, respectively, by virtue of their extremely homogeneous and well-defined structure. additionally, the tetra-peg hydrogels have the advantages of in-situ gel formation and biocompatibility, which is of extreme importance for biomedical purposes [82]. 2.1.2. click chemistry-based (ccb) gel a similar concept to the previously stated was used to fabricate homogeneous hydrogels using click chemistry [88,89], specifically through the copper (i)-catalyzed formation of 1,2,3-triazoles from azides and terminal acetylenes [90]. diacetylene- and tetraazide-functionalized peg derivatives were mixed in presence of copper, which due to the selective chemical reaction employed resulted in a uniformly crosslinked network with improved mechanical properties (fig. 1, ccb gel). indeed, the obtained hydrogels were highly stretchable (ca. up to 1550%) with a tensile strength of ca. 2.39 mpa, which was also attributed to the well-defined architecture of these hydrogels [91]. moreover, the unreacted terminal groups can be used to incorporate different molecules into the hydrogel network without affecting its formation. 2.2. sliding crosslinks 2.2.1. topological (tp) gel a gel with a very elegant molecular design based on sliding crosslinks, named topological (tp) gel, was firstly presented by okumura in 2001 [42]. tp hydrogels can be prepared from polyrotaxanes in which a long polymeric chain is sparsely populated with numerous cyclic molecules caged by large bulky end groups [92]. flexible, transparent and superabsorbent gels were produced by incorporating a-cyclodextrins (a-cd) along the chains of a high molecular weight peg polymer followed by the covalent crosslinking of pairs of a-cds through the action of cyanuric chloride (fig. 1, tp gel) [42]. one of the interesting features about these hydrogels is related with the absence of crosslinking points on the polymeric chains as they are, instead, topological interlocked by a figure-of-eight crosslinkers. as result of the former characteristic and contrarily to fixed chemical or physical crosslinked hydrogels [93], the cyclic molecules are able to slide along the polymeric chain with the aim of equalizing the applied tension (pulley effect) [94]. this unique structure allow these hydrogels to bear extensions up to 20 times their original length without fracture as the gel elasticity is a consequence of only the chain’s topology [95]. 2.3. nanostructures 2.3.1. nanocomposite (nc) gel another approach is based on the incorporation of nanostructures into the main hydrogel network. one example is the nanocomposite (nc) hydrogel which is composed of polymeric chains (organic part) and clay, natural mineral silicate, nanoplatelets (inorganic part) [96]. this hybrid organic/inorganic structure is simply produced by first exfoliating inorganic clays followed by their uniform dispersion in an aqueous solution. specific organic monomers are used to fix the clays nanosheets in this dispersed state and subsequently, the in-situ free radical polymerization is thermally initiated above the clay surface. the clay nanosheets act as multifunctional crosslinkers of the polymer chains since the chain end groups adsorb strongly on this surface by ionic and coordination interactions. in fact, several individual chains are able to attach to a single inorganic substrate. therefore, a transparent, robust, 3d structure composed of flexible polymeric chains connected with different inorganic clay sheets is obtained. for example, the nc hydrogel composed of inorganic synthetic hectrite ([mg5.34li0.66si8o20(oh)4]na0.66) clay slab connected by n-isopropyl acrylamide (nipam) polymeric chains using potassium peroxodisulfate (kps) as radical initiator is highly stretchable (ca. higher than 1000%) and exhibit a high elastic recoverability (ca. 98% of the total deformation), illustrating its overall robustness (fig. 1, nc gel) [43]. these hydrogels are tough, i.e. highly resistant to crack propagation, as in order for this process to occur every single chain connecting different clay sheets need to be broken. furthermore, nc hydrogels properties also include excellent swelling ability (ca. 500 times) and enhanced stimuli sensitivity as the polymer chains are not molecularly restricted by crosslinking points contrarily to what happen on chemical hydrogels [97]. moreover, the high uniformity of these hydrogels is proved by their transparence, which is in high contrast with the conventional hydrogels opacity. nc hydrogels drawbacks include (i) the relative low amount of inorganic clay that can be used to produce these hydrogels (typically lower than 12 wt%) as consequence of the nanoplatelets aggregation, which, in turn, leads to lower mechanical properties, and (ii) their lack of self-healing ability. a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 347 fig. 1. schematic representation and chemical structure of the different strategies described to create strong and tough hydrogels devices, namely: tetra-poly(ethylene) glycol (tetra-peg) gel, click chemistrybased (ccb) gel, topological (tp) gel, nanocomposite (nc) gel, macromolecular microspheres composite (mmc) gel, ionically crosslinked triblock copolymer (itc) gel, hydrophobic interactions-based (hib) gel, polyampholytes (pa) gel, lamellar bilayer (lb) gel and double-network (dn) gel. 348 a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 2.3.2. layered nanocomposite (l-nc) gel one strategy to solve the first problem is based on mimicking the nacre micro- and nano-structure, which curiously constitutes also an inorganic/organic nanocomposite [66]. nacre outstanding elastic modulus, strength and toughness emerge from its well-ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement into organic and inorganic layers [42]. a layered nc (l-nc) was developed by incorporating the clay platelets (laponite xlg, [mg5.34li0.66si8o20(oh)4]na0.66) in a nipam monomer solution containing an initiator. the nanoplatelets were assembled into a lamellar structure by vacuum filtration. after uv irradiation, the in-situ radical polymerization of nipam was initiated, forming the l-nc hydrogel [98]. the superior mechanical properties of the l-nc hydrogels compared with the other nc structures, further proved the importance of designing well-defined microstructures to obtain robust hydrogels. 2.3.3. dendritic nanocomposite (d-nc) gel due to the poor self-healing ability of nc hydrogels, a new supramolecular approach was developed, combining clay nanosheets, dendritic macromolecules and sodium polyacrylate (asap) at mild conditions [99]. the dendritic macromolecules work as ‘‘molecular glue’’ of the nanosheets and are composed of peg chains containing two dendrons units with terminal guanidinium ions [100]. to fabricate these hydrogels, the clay nanosheets were also exfoliated and dispersed homogeneously in water due to the possible repulsion between their positive-charged edge parts and anionic asap. then, the oxyanions presented on the clay nanosheets react with the dendrons yielding a strong hydrogel with self-healing ability. remarkably, when placing in contact freshly cut surfaces of these hydrogels they were able to adhere to each other, showing their capability to recover after structure damage. while the nanosheets are responsible for the high hydrogel strength since they are the main component of this 3d network, the self-healing process is a consequence of the non-covalent attachment of the guanidinium ions with the exfoliated nanosheets [99]. 2.4. microparticles 2.4.1. macromolecular microspheres composite (mmc) gel similar to the nc hydrogels, macromolecular microspheres composite (mmc) networks also allow the control of the crosslinking density and the inter-crosslinking distance, but without the need of an inorganic counterpart, being formed through covalent attachment of network chains to the microparticles. mmc hydrogels were designed by reacting surface activated macromolecular microspheres with polymeric monomers as shown by huang et al. [101]. after the irradiation with 60co c-rays in the presence of oxygen, peroxides were formed on the surface of macromolecular microspheres, which are composed of styrene and butyl acrylate monomers. these groups under heat form free radicals which act as both crosslinkers (responsible for the covalent grafting of poly(acrylic acid) (paa) monomers on the mms) and initiators (responsible for starting paa homopolymerization). this method results in a tough hydrogel due to its well-defined structure, consisting of mms particles connected by paa long chains, which are able to sustain the stress cooperatively (fig. 1, mmc). moreover, inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds can also occur between paa chains, working as an energy dissipation mechanism [102]. in fact, mmc hydrogel (89 wt% water content) sustained a compressive stress of 10.2 mpa for a strain of 97.9%. after loading, the hydrogel structure elastically recovered its original shape for strains higher than 90%. it is worth to notice that by decreasing the water content, a higher compressive stress (78.6 mpa at 99.3% strain) was obtained but the hydrogels were permanently deformed. moreover, their use as cell encapsulation vehicles could be hampered by the need for c-rays [101]. 2.5. supramolecular interactions 2.5.1. ionically crosslinked triblock copolymer (itc) gel in this technique developed by henderson et al. [103] a amphiphilic triblock copolymer consisting of a midblock made of poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) and end blocks of poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma) was physically crosslinked through both (i) ionic crosslinks between the polyelectrolyte mildblocks and (ii) glass spherical domains on pmma end blocks (fig. 1, itc). briefly, this copolymer was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then subjected to a vapor phase solvent exchange process to create the glassy spherical aggregates. the ionic crosslinks were obtain by immersing the physically crosslinked hydrogels into a buffered cation (zn2+, ca2+, ni2+, co2+ and cu2+) solution. tough (1.4 mj m3) and strong (ca. 1 mpa) itc hydrogels were obtained by the reversible association/dissociation of the ionic crosslinks bridging the pmma glass domains [103]. 2.5.2. hydrophobic interactions-based (hib) gel the presence of hydrophobic associations can also serve as a dissipation mechanism since after the unloading, they are able to re-assemble, leading to the hydrogel recovery [104]. hydrophobic interactions can be achieved by introducing hydrophobic sequences within hydrophilic polymeric network via micellar polymerization [105]. combining self-healing, obtained by the presence of supramolecular bonds, with good mechanical properties is non-trivial as these bonds are relatively weak when comparing with covalent ones. acknowledging this shortcoming, gulyuz et al. proposed a new strategy using hydrophobically modified paa polyelectrolyte with oppositely charged cetyltrimethylammonium (cta) surfactant. these 3d structures were produced via micellar copolymerization of hydrophilic aa with hydrophobic stearyl methacrylate by free radical polymerization in ctab aqueous solution containing nabr (fig. 1, hib) [106]. the attained supramolecular hydrogels exhibited a strength as high as 1.7 mpa and elongation at break of 900%. remarkably, these hib hydrogels were a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 349 able to heal either by heating or by surfactant treatment of the damage areas, recovering almost their initial strength (up to 1.5 mpa) and elongation (up to 600%) [106]. 2.5.3. polyampholytes (pa) gel pa gels belong to the physical hydrogels category as they are formed via non-covalent bonds between different charged monomers [107]. this supramolecular structure has multiple ionic bonds with a high disparity of strengths since the polymerization occurs randomly. the strong bonds act as permanent crosslinkers which are responsible for maintaining the original shape, while the weak bonds break upon loading enhancing their fracture energy as well as the self-healing capability by bond re-formation upon unloading. sun et al. obtained a pa gel structure (water content of 50–70 wt%) after mixing a anionic monomer, 3-(methacryloylamino)propyl-trimethylammonium chloride with a cationic monomer, sodium p-styrenesulphonate, in a aqueous solution containing a photoinitiator and nacl followed by uv-irradiation (fig. 1, pa) [107]. the electrostatic attractions between the polymer chains are more stable at high concentrations and near the charge balance, in order to prevent both phase separation and polymer collapse to a globule state [108,109]. the obtained hydrogels exhibit enhanced fracture stress and strain up to 1.8 mpa and 750%, respectively, a high toughness as shown by a fracture energy of 4000 j m2 and a complete recovery after loading until 600%. moreover, these hydrogels were also proved to have excellent biocompatibility using macrophages [107]. although pa structure only possess supramolecular bonds, they are mechanically tough contrarily to other self-healing hydrogels previously developed [99,110]. this toughness was associated with the presence of heterogeneous structure with randomly distributed strong and weak non-covalent bonds. 2.5.4. lamellar bilayer (lb) gel haque et al. reported a tough and anisotropic hydrophilic matrix containing multiple lipid bilayers with unidirectional alignment [111]. the rigid hydrophobic bilayers were composed of a polymerizable surfactant, dodecyl glyceryl itaconate (dgi) whereas the ductile polymeric network was made of polyacrylamide (paam) polymer (fig. 1, lb). the processing method consisted in the self-assembly of dgi monomers into stacked bilayers followed by the free radical polymerization of aam in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of dgi, n0,n0-methylenebis(acylamide) crosslinker and a photoinitiator. the lamellar structure was formed by applying a shear flow to the former precursor solution [112], resulting in an architecture composed of alternating polymer and lipid layers (water content higher than 90%) with a tensile fracture stress of 600 kpa parallel to the lipid bilayers direction. additionally, these hydrogels exhibit a high toughness, self-recovery and fatigue resistance. the previous characteristics arise from the presence of lamellar bilayers, which upon deformation consume a large amount of energy by dissociating themselves before the complete hydrogel fracture. the former fact together with their lipid-like movements are the main reasons behind the lb hydrogels superior mechanical properties [111]. 2.6. second network 2.6.1. double network (dn) gel double network (dn) hydrogels were first introduced by gong et al. in 2003 [41], being the result of combining two polymeric networks with contrasting physical structures and properties [113]. it is worth noting that contrarily to interpenetrating networks (ipns), which are also a combination of two structures, in dn networks the mechanical properties of the combined components are much higher when comparing with the two independent structures, showing a synergistic effect [41]. they are usually composed of a stiff and densely crosslinked (first brittle network) structure in dilute concentration and a ductile and loosely crosslinked (soft second network) structure in high concentration. to effectively improve the mechanical properties, the mass ratio of the second to the first network must be very high (usually 7–20 times that of the first network) in order to get strong dn hydrogels [41,114]. these structures are often synthesized via a two-step sequential free radical polymerization process: (1) the first step involves the formation of a highly crosslinked rigid gel and (2) the second forms a loosely crosslinked network inside the first gel structure. the first structure is often a polyelectrolyte in order to ensure both a high swelling rate and the effective entanglement of the second network within this first structure. this concept was proved to be general and independent of specific chemical interactions between the two networks [107,115]. to date, several tough hydrogels with different macromolecular designs based on dn methodology have been reported such as void-dn gels [116], inverse dn gels [117], liquid crystalline dn gels [118], microgel-reinforced hydrogels [119] and ultra-thin dn gels [120]. one of these tough hydrogels pairs consists of poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (pamps) as the first network and paam as the second structure. the obtained dn hydrogels (ca. 90% water content) exhibit a tensile fracture stress of 2 mpa, hardness with elastic modulus of 0.3 mpa and tearing energy of several thousands of j m2, which are comparable to or even higher than that of cartilage [114,121]. regarding their ability to sustain a compressive stress, they can hold a stress of 17.2 mpa for a strain of ca. 92%, which is much higher than their parents: pams gel break at 0.4 mpa for strain of 41% and paa gel at 0.8 mpa for 84%. upon deformation, the brittle network breaks into small clusters that efficiently disperse the stress around the crack tip into the surrounding damage zone, and thus imparts toughness to the dn gels. on the other side, the second ductile network extends extensively and, thereby, sustaining large deformations. in other words, the first network contributes to an increase on the elastic modulus, whereas the second structure is responsible for the increase on strain [114,115,122]. 350 a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 remarkably, the high-level of inhomogeneities of strong dn hydrogels is the origin of their superior toughness, which is also revealed in other tough biological tissues for instance, in bone, whose heterogeneous porous structure is known to reduce the stress concentrations [19]. 3. natural-origin tough hydrogels among all the polymers that can be used to create hydrogels, natural-origin polymers offer several advantages including their non-toxicity, biocompatibility, the presence of unique biological and chemical features and easiness to fabricate into hydrogels [53]. in fact, some of these polymers are components of native ecm, being responsible for different cell regulation processes spanning from migration to differentiation, and hence, suggesting their potential performance as soft tissues analogues [123,124]. furthermore, versatile chemical structures can be obtained by modifying the high number of functional groups present along their backbone, resulting in materials with improved characteristics for a specific application while retaining crucial biological features [125]. from the commercial point of view, natural-origin materials are often inexpensive as they are readily available from renewable sources [50–52]. despite the aforementioned extraordinary attributes, conventional natural-based hydrogels exhibit low strength, hindering their use in several load-bearing applications [126]. therefore, the strategies described in the former section were employed to create biopolymer-based hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties. such hydrogel systems combine high toughness and strength, obtained by employing the previous described methodologies, with the biocompatibility of natural polymers, whose association was only recently achieved. moreover, their potential for biomedical applications will be also addressed. 3.1. bacterial-cellulose and gelatin extracted from bacteria, bacterial cellulose (bc) consists in a hydrophobic stratified structure composed of alternating dense and sparse ultrafine fiber layers [127]. its structure (water content of ca. 90%) yields unique mechanical properties such as anisotropy, accompanying by a high tensile modulus (ca. 3 mpa) in the fiber-layer direction and low compressive modulus (ca. 0.007 mpa) perpendicular to the stratified layer. although bc hydrogel shows high mechanical properties as compared to other biopolymers, their structure do not recover after compression as result of hydrogen-bond formation between the cellulose fibers (fig. 2i, bc). in order to solve the previously stated drawback, gelatin was incorporated in the bc network, resulting in a bc/gelatin dn hydrogel. gelatin, a polypeptide derived from the denaturation of collagen, is mechanically brittle (compression strain of ca. 0.14 mpa and a compressive modulus of ca. 0.007 mpa), but it is able to sustain several repeated compression cycles without fracture (fig. 2i, gelatin). to synthesize this dn gel, bc was immersed in an aqueous solution containing gelatin that was further crosslinked using n-(3-dimethy-laminopropyl)-n0-ethylcarbodi imede hydrochloride. the combinatorial effect of these two mechanically contrasting structures (hard bc network and soft gelatin structure) resulted in a 3d network able to simultaneously bear a compression stress of ca. 3.7 mpa and recover its original shape after a second compressive deformation up to 30% of strain (fig. 2i, bc/gelatin and 2iia). regarding their tensile properties, bc/gelatin hydrogel exhibit an impressive elastic modulus and stress of ca. 23 mpa and ca. 3 mpa, respectively (fig. 2iib). other polysaccharides such as alginate, gellan-gum and carrageenan were also used to produce dn networks in combination with bc [128]. the resultant mechanical properties of these dn networks are comparable with that of the cartilage, however, the ultimate stress of the bc/gelatin dn hydrogels dramatically decreased after 6 weeks implantation into the subcutaneous tissue of rabbit [129]. the former fact severally hinders their potential application as an artificial substitute of load-bearing soft tissues. additionally, due to the use of toxic crosslinkers, this device may not be a good candidate for cell encapsulation purposes. 3.2. gellan-gum and gelatin the synthetic conditions for dn formation are often incompatible with cell viability due to the use of toxic solvents or/and crosslinkers as well as harsh processing conditions. with the aim of encapsulating cells, dn hydrogels composed of a stiff gellan gum methacrylate (ggma) and a soft gelatin methacrylamide (gelma) structures were synthesized [130]. gg is an anionic polysaccharide extracted from the bacterium sphingomonas elodea [131], being composed of a tetrasaccharide repeating unit of b-d-glucose; b-d-glucuronic acid and a-l-rhamnose. this biopolymer is able to form a gel network by changing their chains conformation from disordered coils to double helices upon cooling, followed by their aggregation through ionic crosslinks in the presence of mono- or divalent cations [132,133]. the ggma/gelma dn hydrogels were produced through a two-step photocrosslinking process by immersing ggma hydrogel, which was obtained after uv-exposure for 120 s in presence of a photoinitiator, in a gelma precursor solution. after the gelma diffusion into the first network a second photocrosslinking process was performed to yield the second network. the resulting dn hydrogels reached a maximum compressive failure stress of ca. 6.9 mpa for a failure strain of 81%. this remarkable behavior may be explained by the presence of the stiff network (ggma) which is responsible for sustaining the applied stress while the soft network dissipates the crack energy avoiding the construct breakdown [134]. moreover, nih-3t3 fibroblasts were successfully encapsulated in the ggma/gelma by suspending these cells in the ggma precursor solution, which was after crosslinked by uv-light exposure [130]. afterward, the cell-loaded ggma hydrogels were placed inside a gelma precursor solution followed by a second a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 351 photocrosslinking process. after 3 days of cell incubation at physiological conditions, it was possible to verify that most of the cells survive within the dn hydrogel matrix as shown by live/dead assay images (fig. 3i), proving the cell-compatibility character of the developed strategy to engineer tough hydrogels for biomedical purposes [130]. irrespective of the high toughness and strength of the previous dn hydrogels, they do not recover after a loading cycle as result of the irreversible covalent-based crosslinking (permanent damage). bakarich et al. designed and fabricated a tough hydrogel with the ability to recover from large strain by mixing hot solutions of gg with acrylamide (aam) monomers, which were then crosslinked through the addition of ca2+ and n,n0-methylenebisacrylamide (mbaam), respectively, in the presence of n,n,n0,n0-tetramethylethylenediamine (temed) and kps [135]. therefore, the gg/paam hydrogels (water content higher than 95%) were composed by an ionically crosslinked gg and a covalently crosslinked paam network, which can withstand ca. 216 kpa in compression (2 and 13 times more stress than the corresponding gg and paam single networks, respectively). although this value is much lower than the previous, the fact that these hydrogels present ionic crosslinks which are weaker allow their elastic recovery under ambient conditions [136]. in addition, gg/paam hydrogels were subjected to several load/unload compression cycles. although they can only recover 53 ± 4% after the first compressive cycle they are able to recover 90 ± 9% after the subsequent cycles, which is much better than the conventional dn hydrogels [114]. recently, the previous process was further polished to attain strong and self-healing hydrogels by using a one-pot synthesis method [137]. to this end, hot aqueous solution of gg was combined with gelatin and, subsequently, crosslinked by the action of ca2+ and genipin, non-cytotoxic crosslinker [138], respectively. these structures containing both ionic (between gg polymer and ca2+ ions) and covalent (between gelatin and genipin) crosslinking mechanisms exhibited a maximum fracture stress of 1.0 mpa and 0.62 mpa in compression and tension, respectively (fig. 3iia). regarding their recoverability, gg/gelatin dn hydrogels were compressed until a stress of 150 kpa and then allowed to rest in both air or immersed in simulated body fluid (sbf) (fig. 3iib and iic). the results revealed that by placing the hydrogels in sbf for time intervals higher than 10 min leads to a recovery of the initial mechanical properties, especially regarding the hysteresis (95 ± 2%), suggesting that these gels were not permanently damaged by the first loading/unloading cycle [137]. in addition, the mmc concept has also employed to create microgel-reinforced ggma/gelma hydrogels [139], showing better mechanical and biological properties over the dn hydrogels using the same biopolymers [130]. briefly, ggma fig. 2. i. photographs

uv-radiation for 120 s. the resulting ggma hydrogels were incorporated in gelma matrix after a second photocrosslinking process for 180 s (fig. 3iii). regarding their mechanical properties, mmc hydrogels were able to withstand a maximum strength of ca. 3.2 mpa, which was higher when comparing with the corresponding ggma/gelma dn structure (ca. 1.5 mpa). this behavior was explained by the higher ggma concentration on mmc gels, enhancing their strength. contrarily, on dn hydrogels the ratio of ggma to gelma is critical to attain the optimized mechanical properties and hence, this component should be prepared at relatively low polymer concentration. additionally, the ggma microgels protect the gelma matrix from fracture by allowing the crack grow in their structures, which due to the microgels dispersion on the gelma structure avoids the crack propagation into macroscopic ones [119]. concerning the biological properties, higher viability rates were observed in mmc hydrogels since the cells were encapsulated in gelma instead of ggma, which present many adhesion sites and hence is recognized as great material for cell encapsulation [140]. on dn hydrogels, cells were firstly encapsulated in a ggma matrix, and hence their contact with gelatin may be hindered, which may explain the lower viability rates when comparing with the mmc hydrogels. fig. 3. i. live/dead

353 furthermore, alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity and the amount of mineralization revealed the osteogenic behavior of mc3t3-e1 cells when encapsulated on the ggma/gelma mmc hydrogels. interestingly, the gelma precursor solution containing ggma microgels can be possibly injected followed by in situ photocrosslinking, after the assessment of the light penetration ability [139]. 3.3. chitin chitin is the second most available polymer in nature being mainly obtained from crustaceans [141]. this biopolymer present some interesting features for biomedical applications such as biocompatibility, antibacterial character and nontoxicity. due to its inherently poor mechanical behavior, chitin have been mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva), a synthetic and biocompatible polymer [142], with the aim of creating a tough hydrogel structure [143]. these hydrogels were obtained by first dissolving chitin in naoh/urea aqueous solution containing the pva polymer followed by crosslinking with epichlorohydrin (ech). moreover, to form pva crystals and physically crosslink this synthetic material, a freezing-thawing method was employed [142,144]. the resultant chitin/pva hydrogel composite is composed by two crosslinking mechanisms, namely (1) a chemical (between chitin and ech) and (2) a physical (hydrogen bonds between pva and chitin chains). additionally, pva intermolecular interactions can lead to the formation of crystallites which, in turn, can ensure a higher stability of the hydrogel. interestingly, the morphology of the obtained hydrogels containing 25% of pva was found to be very similar to the one of the jellyfish (fig. 4i shows a non-ordered chitin/pva structure while fig. 4ii displays an ordered layered structure) [144]. the obtained ordered and layered porous structure, in which the hydrophilic pva crystals are tightly immobilized on the chitin backbone matrix through the presence of hydrogen bonds, was ascribed to the performed freezing/ thawing cycles. moreover, during the freezing/thawing cycles a microphase separation between the formed crystalline ice and pva crystals can also explain the obtained ordered structure. in fact, these hydrogels containing a jelly-fish like architecture were found to result in higher mechanical properties (compressive strength of 2.1 mpa and strain at break of 80%, fig. 4iii) than other hybrid gels containing different amounts of pva polymer and also when comparing with pure chitin. the former fact have been related with the effective dispersion of the stress by multilayered structures, and hence, higher external stresses are needed in order to break this well-defined structure [145]. additionally, these chitin/pva hydrogels were proved to be cytocompatible after both l929 fibroblasts and mdkc cells seeding on its surface [143]. the combination of the aforementioned characteristics, namely their cytocompatibility, high mechanical properties and well-defined structure, highlights chitin/pva hydrogel potential as an artificial substitute of load-bearing soft tissues. however, their use for cell encapsulation purposes may be compromised by the need for toxic reagents and harsh processing conditions, such as the freezing–thawing cycles. 3.4. alginate one of the most used biomaterials is alginate due to its gelling properties in mild conditions [146]. this neutral polysaccharide is mainly obtained from brown algae and is composed of (1?4)-linked b-d-mannuronic acid and a-l-guluronic acid residues [33,147]. these monomers are organized in blocks rich in mannuronic acid, blocks rich in guluronic acid units and blocks rich in both units. the gelling process occurs through interactions between the carboxylic acid moieties and bivalent counter ions such as calcium [136,148]. sun et al. developed a highly stretchable hybrid hydrogel composed of two crosslinked polymer networks: an ionically crosslinked alginate through the presence of ca2+ and a covalently crosslinked paam using mbaam as crosslinker. the introduction of a non-covalent crosslinking mechanism allowed this hydrogel to recover upon unloading, which is not possible in conventional dn hydrogels. during deformation, the alginate network fig. 4. i. photographs depicting the fesem results of the cross-sections for the resultant chitin/poly(vinyl alcohol) (rcp)

unzipping its ionic crosslinks while the paam structure preserve its mechanical integrity. after unloading, the reversible ionic bonds can be reformed. these hybrid hydrogels with ca. 90% of water in their composition presented a tensile fracture stress, elongation and energy of 156 kpa, 20 times their initial length, and 9000 j m2, respectively. this outstanding fracture energy is much higher than the one of conventional hydrogels and have been ascribed to the energy dissipation occurring upon the unzip of the alginate chains [71]. in vivo results obtained upon implantation of these structures into dorsal subcutaneous pockets in rats suggested a minimal inflammatory response by the absence of macrophages and lymphocytes infiltration after 8 weeks, highlighting their potential for biomedical applications [149]. although the alginate/paam hydrogels exhibited an outstanding toughness, they have a relatively low stiffness, which is mainly due to the alginate low concentration (further increase is hindered by the high viscosity of the final solution) and crosslinking density (calcium sulfate crosslinker has poor solubility in water). realizing this difficulty, li et al. introduced a hybrid alginate/paam hydrogel with both high stiffness and toughness by increasing both of the aforementioned aspects. while the alginate concentration was increased using alginate with different molecular weights, the crosslinking density was improved through the combination of calcium sulfate and calcium chloride (fig. 5ia) [150]. the results suggested that by increasing the amount of low molecular weight alginate while fixing the total alginate concentration, the stiffness remained constant (ca. 1 mpa) whereas the toughness increased, reaching the remarkable fracture energy of ca. 16 kj m2 (fig. 5ib). this phenomenon was related with the decrease of strength upon increasing the fraction of short-chains, resulting in the growing of the region near the crack tip where the energy is dissipated, which, in turn, increases the toughness [150]. alginate containing phenylboronic acid (pba) was combined with pva to yield a supramolecular hydrogel with both shape memory and self-healing ability (fig. 5iia) [151]. on the one hand, the shape memory properties were conferred by the presence of ionic crosslinks between alginate and ca2+, which can retain the temporary shape (100%), and then, recover to the permanent shape by extracting these cations using na2co3 (recovery ratio of ca. 100%) or edta (recovery ratio of ca. 92%) (fig. 5iib). on the other hand, the presence of supramolecular bonds, in particular, through the reversible pba-diol ester bond interaction between pba groups of alginate-pba and the pva hydroxyl groups, is responsible for the self-recovery ability. this recoverability was demonstrated by pressing tightly freshly cut pieces of this hydrogel as shown in fig. 5iic [151]. fig. 5. i.

seaweeds, is able to form a hydrogel network by a thermoreversible sol–gel transition upon cooling to 30–40 c [152]. a one-pot methodology was introduce by chen et al. to replace the conventional time-consuming dn multi-step polymerization process through the simultaneous mixing of agar, aam monomers, initiators and chemical crosslinkers at 90– 95 c followed by cooling the precursor solution to physically crosslink agar. the second paam structure is formed within the agarose structure after uv-light irradiation. agar/paam dn hydrogels were tough with a compression modulus, stress and strain of 123 kpa, 38 mpa and 98%, respectively. moreover, these dn hydrogels were able to recover their initial shape after being subjected to several types of deformation such as bending (fig. 6ia), knotting (fig. 6ib), compression (fig. 6ic) and elongation (fig. 6id), and also showed the ability to be synthesized with any shape (fig. 6ie–g). interestingly, the network of agar/paam hydrogels can be recovered taking advantage of the agar thermoreversible nature as observed by the hysteresis loop recovery after 10 min at 100 c (above the agar melting point; fig. 6iia), which has not observed at 50 c (below the agar melting point; fig. 6iib). therefore, these hydrogels combine superior mechanical properties and recoverability capabilities, highlighting their potential as load-bearing artificial soft tissues analogues. however, these agar/paam hydrogels may not be suitable for cell encapsulation purposes due to the presence of toxic aam monomers. 3.6. carrageenan tough and recoverable hydrogels were produced from carrageenan using dn-based method [154]. carrageenan, a partially sulfated polysaccharide obtained from red seaweeds, is composed by b-d-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-a-d-galactose units [51]. according with the degree of sulfation, three kinds of carrageenan can be obtained, namely, kappa-carrageenan (kc) with one sulfate per disaccharide, iota-carrageenan (ic) with two sulfates per disaccharide and lambda-carrageenan (lc) which is highly sulfated [51]. kc and ic polymers form hydrogels through ionic crosslinks between cations and double helix units, which are formed by changing the temperature. these two derivatives of carrageenan biopolymer were used to produce kc/paam dn hydrogels and ic/paam dn by mixing kc or ic polymers with aam monomer in water containing kps and mbaam at 70 c followed by cooling down to 25 c. consequently, this hydrogel combines an ionic carrageenan network with a covalent paam network, which resulted in a high strength and tough structure at both fig. 6. photographs depicting the agar/poly(acrylamide) (paam) hydrogels ability to withstand different types of deformation: bending (a); knotting (b); compression (c); knotting and stretching; and to adapt to different shapes: hexagon (e); teddy-bear during compression (f); and teddy-bear gel after unload (g). ii. load/unload cycle’s

(2015) 344–364 compression (ca. 9.9 mpa and 4.0 mpa for kc and ic, respectively) and tension (ca. 75 kpa and 107 kpa for kc and ic, respectively) (fig. 7ia and ib). the improved mechanical properties of ic/paam dn hydrogels (compression, elongation, bending, knotting) can be observed in fig. 7iia–e. while kc/paam dn hydrogels presented a higher modulus (40.8 kpa), the ic is tougher (fracture energy of 9500 j m2). a quick recover ability was easily observed by forcing the hydrogel to pass through a buttonhole (fig. 7ii). this mechanical behavior is the result of the presence of carrageenan ionic bonds, which are firstly broken upon loading, bridging the main paam backbone structure, which, in turn, is responsible for maintaining the hydrogel structure. interestingly, these dn hydrogels were able to heal from their cracks at mild temperatures, by the reestablishment of the broken supramolecular bonds. as described for the agar/paam hydrogels, the presence of aam monomers may hamper their use as cell-laden devices. 3.7. hyaluronan hyaluronan (ha) is a natural occurring glycosaminoglycan, being abundant in connective, epithelial and neural tissues. its structure has d-glucuronic acid and d-n-acetylglucosamine units linked together via alternating b-1,4-and b-1,3 glycosidic bonds [155]. as this polysaccharide is part of the ecm, it is promisor for applications where one intends to mimic such extracellular environment [156]. interpenetrated networks containing ha have been proposed [157] but efforts have been recently done to develop hydrogels with improved mechanical behavior based on the dn strategy. a first network made of methacrylate ha (pha), a photocrosslinkable derivative of ha polymer, was prepared by uv irradiation for 2 h in presence of a photoinitiator. then, the resulting covalently crosslinked structure was immersed in a solution containing n,n-dimethylacrylamide (daam) monomers. after reaching the equilibrium, the second polymeric network was formed by uv exposure for 2 h in presence of mbaam crosslinker and a photoinitiator, yielding a pha/pdaam dn hydrogel. even though these hydrogels are mostly composed of water (more than 90%), the mechanical assays revealed a fracture stress fig. 7. i. typical compression (a) and tensile (b) stress–strain curves of poly(acrylamide) (paam), iota-carrageenan (ic)/paam dn hydrogel and

european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 357 as high as 5.2 mpa for a strain of 87.1% and compressive moduli of 0.1 mpa, which is much higher than pure pha hydrogel (fracture stress, strain and compressive modulus of 0.29 mpa, 56.1% and 0.045 mpa, respectively). these properties resulted from the combination of a stiff but brittle ha network and one soft but ductile pdaam network. these dn-based hydrogels can effectively dissipate the stress imposed during compression by either deforming the network conformation and/or sliding the physical entanglements points along the polymer chains. additionally, these robust hydrogels were shown to be non-cytotoxic and resistant to fibroblast cells degradation after 2 months of cell culture [158]. the previous characteristics combined with the superior mechanical behavior allow their potential application as replacers of load bearing tissues. 3.8. chondroitin sulfate other biopolymer that is also found in the ecm of biological tissues, is chondroitin sulfate, being responsible for providing ecm strength. chondroitin sulfate constitutes a sulfated polysaccharide made of both n-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid sugars. recently, a novel method was developed to produce tough dn gel combining a neutral and biocompatible polymer with any polyelectrolyte biopolymer [159]. in this work, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate were used as molecular stents and were combined with a neutral pdaam polymer. to this end, the biopolymer was added to an aqueous solution containing the neutral monomer followed by its polymerization into a first pdaam network. since the biopolymer (polyelectrolyte) is physically trapped within the first polymer network, this structure is able to swell allowing the incorporation of a second neutral monomer needed to create a tough dn hydrogel. as can be observed in fig. 8, only the incorporation of biopolymers in the first neutral structure do not contribute to the increase of fig. 8. i. tensile stress–strain curves of single-network gels (a) and double-network gels (b) without biopolymers (red) and with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans

344–364 the overall mechanical properties (fig. 8ia); however, the incorporation of a second matrix within the first one resulted in hydrogels with extraordinary mechanical properties (fig. 8ib). moreover, the potential of using biopolymers to increase the biological activity was assessed by seeding hcaes above the dn hydrogels with or without biopolymers. the results revealed a cell spherical-like shape on the sample without molecular stents (fig. 8iia) whereas cells showed their typical spindle shape in the presence of the biopolymer (fig. 8iib). the described strategy combines the strength and toughness of dn hydrogels with the bioactivity of biopolymers, enhancing their potential as soft tissues analogues. moreover, this methodology is general in the sense that allows the introduction of any biopolymers without chemical modification and any neutral polymer [159]. 4. final remarks and future trends as result of the high prevalence of degenerative diseases commonly suffered by old people, and the frequent occurrence of injuries in athletes, tissue repair have been highlighted as a hot research topic for some years now [160]. early procedures for the treatment of these lesions explored the transplantation of organs or tissues to the site of injury; however, this practice presents collateral effects such as the possible damage of the donor site, disease transmission and recipient rejection as well as shortage of donors [161,162]. consequently, new alternatives to grafts and artificial hard and dry substitutes are nowadays explored for repairing soft tissues, for instance, the promising te technique. generally speaking, te approaches aim at developing materials that can induce and guide cell proliferation, differentiation, and new tissue formation at the site of tissue injury or defect [126]. accordingly, recapitulating the characteristic found in native ecm such as solutes permeability, high strength, large deformation, biocompatibility and bioactivity is likely to be the most favorable strategy to create scaffold-based te [37,163]. notably, hydrogels provide a highly hydrated microenvironment similar to the native ecm, and hence, they have been pointed as prospective candidates for tissue repair [33,164]. as compared with other class of materials such as metals and ceramics, hydrogels exhibit the lowest rigidity, which is comparable with the one found in native soft tissues [10]. this softness constitutes a crucial aspect to consider when designing a biomaterial to mimic the ecm since it minimizes the irritation of the surrounding tissues [39]. however, regarding the toughness and strength, a large difference between natural tissues and biomaterials arises [165] as conventional hydrogels are often brittle with fracture energies lower than 10 j m2, which are far from the 1000 j m2 of cartilage [166]. recent advances in gel science were made through the development of a plethora of approaches to create customizable 3d polymeric network with superior mechanical properties. these strategies are based on the incorporation of different entities into a hydrogel structure, for instance, nc and mmc hydrogels have multifunctional crosslinkers to effectively diminish the structural inhomogeneity [43,101]; tp hydrogels present sliding crosslinks whose position on the polymeric network can be adjusted to cooperatively sustain the strain [42]; tetra-peg, ccb, pa hydrogels are the result of combining different monomers with different functional groups to create strong structures [82,91,107]; lb hydrogels have lamellar bilayers to provide high toughness and self-healing ability [111]; dn hydrogels are based on the introduction of a second polymeric matrix which consequently increase the fracture stress and toughness [41]. therefore, the brittleness of conventional hydrogels can be suppressed by changing their network structure, which consists in randomly interconnected chains made from single polymers. homogeneous hydrogels prevent the crack progression through the decrease of the strand length distribution, and consequently, the stress can be equally sustained by all the strands. contrarily, heterogeneous hydrogels suggest that heterogeneity is desirable considering that their toughening method depends on multiple random fractures. moreover, the toughness of a material can be severely enhanced by introducing energy-dissipation methods. several recent works have replaced the irreversible covalent bonds by supramolecular ones, for instance, hydrophobic associations [74,104,106], ionic crosslinks [103,107] and hydrogen bonds [73]. all of these methods constitute new concepts which can be applied to create strong, tough and endurable devices. the choice of the most suitable strategy will rely on the required properties for a specific application. for instance, if high elongations and low stiffness are needed (>8 times the original length) homogeneous hydrogels could be used such as sr gels. besides the previous characteristics, dn hydrogels possesses also a high toughness, which may also be a requisite for a particular purpose. however, if stiffness is crucial, l-nc should be preferentially selected at the expense of lower strength values. furthermore, a combination of the different strategies should also be envisaged as this would result in hydrogels with improved mechanical properties [167–169]. a recent theme that has attracted much attention in the biomaterials field is the fabrication of tough hydrogels for many load-bearing biomedical applications [113]. in this sense, biocompatibility is fundamental and can be achieved through the construction of biopolymer-based hydrogels [126]. taking advantage of the previously stated methodologies to synthesize strong and tough hydrogels, researchers have engineered a variety of systems to meet the complex biological and mechanical requirements of te. undoubtedly, among all the methods, the dn approach affords the highest versatility in terms of composition and resulting properties, and therefore, it has been extensively employed by combining, for instance, bacterial-cellulose with gelatin, alginate, carrageenan or gellan-gum [128]; gellan-gum derivatives with gelatin [137,139] or poly(acrylamide) [135,139]; chitin with poly(vinyl alcohol) [143]; alginate derivatives with poly(vinyl alcohol) [151] or poly(acrylamide) [71,150]; agar with poly(acrylamide) [153]; carrageenan with poly(acrylamide) [154]; acid hyaluronic derivatives with poly(dimethylacrylamide) [167]; and chondroitin sulfate with poly(acrylamide) [159], resulting in structures with improved strength and toughness which is of outmost importance for tissue repair. more hydrogels systems were already developed combining other natural-origin materials [140,170]. a.m.s. costa, j.f. mano / european polymer journal 72 (2015) 344–364 359 hydrogel scientists may also use some hints found in nature occurring hydrogels to design structural materials with superior mechanical properties [171]. some animals like jellyfish and sea cucumber are examples of 3d networks with high water content, which exhibit a high tensile and compressive moduli [143,172]. these exceptional features found in biological tissues are mainly due to the presence of a sophisticated architecture from more than one type of molecule [173]. in particular, ecm can be conceived as a crosslinked matrix with a well-ordered structure on various length scales made of proteins such as collagen or elastin intertwined with high molecular weight molecules such as some polysaccharides (including hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate) [174]. having this in mind, the control of the hydrogel microstructure would potentially yield artificial substitutes of native tissues with outstanding mechanical performances [172,175]. in this review some of the attempted approaches to recapture the ecm structure were described, showing impressive mechanical properties when comparing with non-order structures made of the same materials [98,111,143]. these unique microstructures are able to effectively distribute the applied load over a wide area, slowing down the crack propagation and therefore, avoid the material fracture [145]. however, the reconstruction of the biotissues structure is extremely daunting [163]. realizing this difficulty, wang et al. proposed a peculiar way of preserving this natural feature by incorporating paam or paa polymers into a fresh jellyfish (jf) gel, which is mainly composed of collagen and water (ca. 99 wt% after salt extraction) with layered structure [145]. interestingly, only the native jf gel structure was able to withstand 1.16 mpa in compression and 21.3 kpa in tension, which is higher when comparing with conventional hydrogels. the incorporation of the paam and paa polymers into the jellyfish gel resulted in hydrogels with strengths several tens times higher than those of jf and the corresponding paam or paa structures [145], proving the importance of a well-defined microstructure to obtain hydrogels with superior mechanical properties. in addition, this defined organization may have beneficial biological features, for instance, by promoting cell infiltration and neovascularization [176,177]. this knowledge open a new venue for the creation of materials with diverse functions simply by replacing non-ordered structure by a well-developed microstructure, instead of selecting a new material. although this review mainly focus on the hydrogels mechanical properties and biocompatibility, other aspects should also be considered to achieve the ultimate goal of te. besides providing an initial support for cell adhesion and proliferation, 3d artificial matrices should reproduce relevant native biochemical and biophysical microenvironments to pave a way toward the engineering of functional tissues [177]. several studies demonstrated that the incorporation of bioclues (e.g. cell-binding motifs) and/or biological factors (e.g. growth factors) are crucial to ensure the cell viability and proliferation inasmuch as they constitute instructive microenvironment molecules to improve the cell/matrix interaction [52,176,178,179]. one research area, less studied in the past few years, is the design and construction of tough hydrogels with controlled degradation behavior. this degradability could be virtually introduced by labile bonds either on the polymer backbone or on the crosslinkers used to create the hydrogels, which can be later enzymatical or chemically broken under physiological conditions. moreover, this degradation should be tailored and the degradation products should be non-cytotoxic [76]. more recent approaches are also exploring non-invasive and patient-friendly procedures involving the targeted administration of therapeutic molecules, such as growth factors, within materials mimicking the mechanical and biological conditions of the site to be treated [180]. in this sense, loaded injectable polymeric precursors able to self-assemble or crosslink into strong and biocompatible 3d networks after their injection, should also be developed. therefore, it is anticipated that hydrogels with high toughness, strength, recoverability, a well-defined architecture, biocompatibility and bioactivity will certainly enhance the applicability of these polymeric networks in the biomedical field [120,181]. however, the current state of research in this area is mainly focused on the improvement of the physicochemical properties of hydrogels and less on recapturing all the native ecm environment, and hence, must go further to significantly improve the applications of hydrogels in diverse areas. the concepts and techniques summarized in this review to enhance the mechanical properties of conventional hydrogels are very promising for load-bearing applications. in particular, advanced strategies that combine simultaneously superior mechanical properties and biocompatibility of hydrogels are expected to expand the range of application to the tissue engineering field. we believe that this review will serve as guide in future development of natural-origin hydrogels for biomedical applications, especially as cell-laden analogues of load-bearing soft tissues and ecm artificial substitutes. acknowledgements a.m.s.c. thanks fct (fundação para a ciência e a tecnologia) for financial support through phd grant sfrh/bd/101748/2014.
