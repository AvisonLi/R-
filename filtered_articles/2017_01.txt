available online 3 may 2017 jel classification: c2 d12 q4 in parallel with worldwide population growth, europe is experiencing a fast demographic shift widely studied but generally undervalued by policymakers. population aging may imply smaller household sizes and more home-based energy consumption, which will change the energy mix. consumer preference shifts and different attitudes towards environment among the generations determine additional effects. study of the link between an aging population and energy demand is even more important for italy because its energy dependence is almost complete and its population is aging quickly. this paper aims to assess the role of changing generational preferences in the energy expenditure trend in italy by distinguishing between a pure age effect and a cohort effect. the decomposition shows significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, thus confirming that, beside an aging effect, we must consider that recent generations have a higher residential energy expenditure. indeed, the energy culture of post war italian generations seems more linked to thermal comfort (heating and air conditioning) than to environmental attitudes. © 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. keywords: energy consumption cohort effects pseudopanel data 1. introduction population aging is a long-term trend which began several decades ago in europe. the growth in the relative share of older people may be explained, among other things, by a rise in life expectancy, and specifically by an increase in life expectancy in good health. the share of elderly people in the total population will significantly increase in the near future as the post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement. this trend is particularly marked in italy, where the proportion of the population aged 65 and over (21% in 2014) is the highest among european countries and it is projected to rise further by 2050. the economic effects of an aging population have been extensively studied and following the pioneering contributions by ramsey and modigliani, life-cycle theory shows that aggregate consumption and savings are affected by the age structure of the population. in other words, the distribution of age groups among the population matters because households adapt consumption behaviour to the needs of different life-cycle phases. only recently has attention been devoted to the energy-related behaviour of different age groups: this is probably connected to awareness of climate change as the related literature agrees on the fact that an aging population may hinder public policy efforts to reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions.1 this alarm is linked to the fact that as a result of a less active lifestyle elderly people have a higher energy demand for heating and electricity. however, the picture is more complex than expected, and several factors – such as aggregate income trends, consumer preferences and societal transformation – may play roles with contradictory effects. setting aside the macroeconomic aggregate results of these counteracting forces, in this paper we stress the microeconomic perspective by looking at household heterogeneity in terms of age and generation. we use data drawn from the italian household budget survey to perform a pooled regression analysis and a study of cohort groups with the aim of disentangling age and cohort effects. the pooled analysis confirms the main findings in the international literature highlighting that dwelling and personal characteristics – among which age – are key factors explaining household residential energy demand. we then analyse how relevant the interplay between age and cohort effects is by applying the decomposition between cohort, age and year effects presented by deaton and paxson (1994). empirical evidence reveals significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, showing that expenditure rises with age, yet this pure age effect interplays with cultural factors which differ across generations. similarities in social experiences and cultural influences shape energy

expenditure. the paper is organized as follows. after a survey of the literature on the linkages between aging and energy consumption (section 2), section 3 briefly discusses the residential energy intensity of italian households. section 4 describes the dataset and in section 5 the results of a pooled regression analysis are discussed. the cohort analysis is introduced in section 6 and the results of the decomposition of age, period and cohort effects are presented. the final section contains our conclusions. 2. residential energy demand and an aging population: a survey of the related literature most of the international economics literature analysing residential energy consumption agrees on the fact that household energy demand is a combination of non-human (such as dwelling and weather conditions) and human characteristics, the latter including demographic, psychological and cultural elements. weather conditions and meteorological temperature levels are widely used as control variables in household energy demand models. indeed, a growing literature estimating the elasticity of energy demand to temperature variation has been trying to assess the global warming impact on heating and cooling expenditure.2 as expected, there is a negative link between temperature levels and heating-related energy demand, whereas a positive link is evident for cooling-related expenditure. however, there are non-linearities in this kind of relation due to both threshold effects and cultural components. by using dutch micro data, brounen et al. (2012) find that the characteristics of the dwelling are more relevant for gas and heating consumption whereas electricity consumption is more affected by demographic characteristics. moreover, they find that electricity is more sensitive to income fluctuations than gas consumption. they also document a strong relationship between the age and characteristics of dwellings (with detached houses using more energy) and their resource consumption. according to their estimates, recently built dwellings use about 65% less gas for heating than those constructed prior toworld war ii, due to improvements in construction technology and insulation, and this is especially true for those dwellings built after the oil shock. on the contrary, they find greater electricity consumption in post-war buildings and especially in those of recent construction. costas and kahn (2011) estimate a link between electricity consumption per dwelling and the electricity price at the time the building was built, because low electricity prices at the time of construction reduce the incentive to install energy efficient devices. therefore, consumers exhibit a time preference bias because they seem unable to take into consideration price changes. turning to socio-economic characteristics, several studies highlight the relevance of economies of scale with regard to residential energy use, so that household size is a key variable. economies of scale mean that small households use more energy per capita to maintain a certain level of energy-related services (heating, hot water, cooking facilities). ironmonger et al. (1995) estimate significant economies of scale in australian household energy use and expenditure on energy, with small differences among household types but clear evidence of diseconomies of scale for older households. this penalization of elderly households is linked to lower income levels and to smaller household size. householdswith higher levels of education tend to adoptmore environmentally friendly behaviours (torgler et al., 2008) and are perhaps more willing to reduce their carbon footprints. from another point of view, such individuals are more likely to fully consider energy saving cost reduction or to take advantage of energy saving tax incentives, so they aremore likely to insulate their homes or install energy production devices such as solar panels. longhi (2015) finds that in the uk those households where at least one member has a university degree spend on average about 2% per capita less on energy overall, but the impact is lower if pro-environmental attitudes are considered. this suggests that peoplewith higher education levelsmay bemore aware of environmental problems andmorewilling to adopt pro-environmental types of behaviour, even after controlling for household income. income level per se is important, but less relevant to predicting consumption heterogeneity than expected. income elasticity estimates vary widely among studies, with a tendency to be smaller when using microdata sets. as a general finding, elasticities are higher for heating-related than electricity expenditures. similarly, changes in household socio-economic circumstances (such as entering unemployment) translate into changes in energy consumption, but their impact is small compared to that of dwelling characteristics (on gas expenditure) and especially household size (longhi, 2015).3 homeownership is also important because it influences the propensity to invest in energy saving. however as meier and rehdanz (2010) and longhi (2015) document, uk homeowners seem to have a higher energy expenditure (7% more than households in rented houses, according to longhi, 2015), notwithstanding this greater propensity to invest in energy-saving measures. what about the interaction between household age structures – or more generally population aging – and these drivers of energy consumption? as a general finding, household energy consumption tends to change over the lifespan and an inverted u shape can be observedwhen considering household energy expenditure and average family age or householder age. this is due to a changing size and composition of the household, so that when the householder's age is between 40 and 60 there is the highest probability of there being overlapping generations in the house. in particular, aging is usually associatedwith higher energy expenditure and ghg emissions: older households spend more on energy, especially on heating, because they occupy houses for a larger proportion of the day and they usually need more heating comfort. aging can also have indirect impacts through an associated decline in household size and consequently a loss of economies of scale in energy use at the household level. the decrease in average household size is not a particular feature of aged people but can be considered a general pattern of modern society observable in almost all industrialized countries, among which italy. using a panel of japanese households, schröder et al. (2015) estimate that a 5% decline in average household size during the period 2005–10 resulted in forgone household economies of scale equivalent to a 3.5% increase in household-sector energy demand. this trend of declining household size therefore resolves in an upward pressure on total residential energy use that can be only partially offset by enhancing the efficiency of the home and its appliances. moreover, older households generally have lower income levels and this acts as a factor mitigating energy demand, but at the same time acts to further lower energy saving investment. what can consumer culture, which can be particular to different cohorts, add to this general analysis of physical and demographic characteristics? it is widely known that the traditional neo-classical assumptions of cost minimization provide a somewhat poor model for interpreting actual energy-related choices. energy consumption patterns vary greatly between apparently similar types of household, either when looking at cross-sectional data, or when considering different cohorts. this heterogeneity goes beyond bias and errors in evaluating costs and price signals,4 and can be better described by looking at characteristics of energy culture. according to stephenson et al. (2010), energy choices can be understood by looking at the interactions 2 for a cross country analysis, see petrick et al. (2012). 3 on this point, see espey and espey (2004). 4 the behavioural literature widely discusses the reasons for non-optimized energy demand behaviour, and especially regarding energy saving investment. on this topic, see maréchal (2010). 162 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 between “cognitive norms, (e.g. beliefs, understandings),material culture (e.g. technologies, building form) and energy practices (e.g. activities, processes).”5 energy culture standards are not immutable. on the contrary, new standards can be rapidly adopted and they can be shaped by prevalent behaviours in society as well as by technology availability. with better health and greater wealth than their parents' generation, newly retired people may be able to fulfil ambitions of leisure activities and travel. these newolder cohorts are likely to be in a position to access goods associated with comfort and leisure, among which electronic equipment and digital connectivity (including social networking) play a key role. a recent survey in the uk reveals that the spending share on leisure goods is relatively similar across age groups, whereas for leisure services to be used outside the home only the oldest pensioners (aged over 80) spend notably less (hamza and gilroy, 2011). carlsson- kanyama et al. (2005) conclude that generationsmatterwhen residential energy consumption is considered. they find “differences in housing standards, consumption and environmental behaviour between generations born during the 1940s compared to those born in the 1950s, 1960s and later….”6 and they link this effect to the different stages of development of the swedish economy, which after the war world ii period of shortage of goods entered the ‘consumer society’ in the sixties. it can be said that generations are characterized by common consumer experiences,which in turn define future consumption patterns. the links between the main human/non-human characteristics and residential energy demand are summarized in the first column of fig. 1. 5 stephenson et al. (2010), p. 6124. 6 carlsson-kanyama et al. (2005), p. 250. fig. 1. interacting forces on residential energy demand. r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 163 in the second column, some issues raised by an aging population are highlighted. 3. italian residential energy intensity: the end of energy-saving primacy? despite italy having one of the lowest levels of energy intensity, both at the gdp and household consumption levels, progress has slowed down and at the moment the energy efficiency targets set at the eu level seem beyond any concrete possibility. the structural low level of energy intensity can be attributed to a number of factors, including the mild mediterranean climate, the structure of economic activities and the traditional high energy dependency, which in turn causes high energy prices.7 the already-good energy efficiency of italian households further improved by 10% over the period 2000–2012, compared to the eu average of 19%. this relatively slow progress was mainly linked to a mix of further increases in energy prices and public incentives to promote energy-saving maintenance for buildings and fixtures. regarding electricity use, italian families increased their consumption by 2.2% over the same timespan, whereas at the eu level only a 1.3% increasewas recorded. this difference is due to lower energy-saving results for italy. looking at space heating, the eu and italy exhibit opposite trends. on average, eu citizens reduced the amount of energy used for space heating thanks to more energy efficiency and a change in their heating attitudes. italy, on the contrary, showed an increase in energy consumption connected to an increase in the number of dwellings and to a change in heating behaviour that energy saving and the milder climate could not compensate for (fig. 2). 4. the data in order to understand the relative importance of energy demand drivers, we use data on household expenditure collected through the household budget survey (ihbs) published by the italian statistical office (istat). altogether, some 22,000 households are sampled throughout the year to represent the italian population at the regional level. beside sociodemographic characteristics, the survey collects information about expenditure on household goods and services.8 our analysis uses observations for the period 1997–2013, and therefore includes the years of economic downturn after 2007. the survey is designed as a repeated cross section so it is not possible to look at the behaviour of the same individuals over time, but different ages in different groups of households can be observed. a cross-sectional analysis of energy expenditure is useful to provide an idea of how households with different characteristics compare, but it is difficult to disentangle structural heterogeneity and behavioural differences or changes. the dataset contains data on energy expenditure, dwelling characteristics and sociodemographic factors formore than 20,000 households each year.households are grouped according to the head's year of birth9 using five-year age classes.10 as we are interested in distinguishing energy demand by age, table 1 reports data on weighted frequencies and on household size by age class at the beginning and end of the period observed. the table highlights how profoundly demographic trends are shaping the population structure in italy: the share of households with the householder aged 65 or over was 30.7% in 1997 and became 35.5% in 2013 (18.8% for those aged 75 or over). at the same time, we can also observe a sharp increase in household numbers (more than 4 million) and a decrease in the average family size (from 2.7 in 1997 to 2.3 in 2013). as is generally agreed, a smaller household size means a loss of economies of scale and greater vulnerability to fuel poverty. table 2 shows a clear increase in the share of residential energy expenditure in total consumption expenditure, from an average of 5.7% in 1997 to 6.3% in 2013. this share increases linearly with age class, confirming the hypothesis that elderly people need more thermal comfort and spend more on heating. as faiella and lavecchia (2015) discuss, an energy share level above 6% represents a historical peak and it is the result of two factors: a greater increase in energy price indexes with respect to the overall consumption price index and the effect of the financial crisis on average income and total expenditure.11 during the period observed, both overall per capita heating and electricity 7 an in-depth analysis of energy intensity and the structure of energy prices in italy – which include a considerable share of taxes and quasi-taxes to finance a renewable incentive system – can be found in bardazzi and pazienza (2016). 8 the categories included are: food and beverages, household appliances and durables, household maintenance and operation, clothing, health expenditure, transport and

person as indicated in the civil registry. householders under 18 have been excluded from our dataset. 10 the microdata released only report the age of household members as a continuous variable for the years 1997–2001. since 2002, istat has adopted a new methodology to protect the privacy of the individuals surveyed. therefore, for the years 2002–2013 the age variable is aggregated into 15 classes (0–5; 6–14; 15–17, 18–24; 25–29; 30–34; 35– 39; 40–44; 45–49; 50–54; 55–59; 60–64; 65–69; 70–74; and 75 and over). 11 although themeasurement of fuel poverty is a key research issuewith several indicators being used in the literature (see faiella and lavecchia, 2015), in table 2 a very rough measure is shown. a household is considered ‘fuel poor’ if the family spends more than 10% of its total expenditure on fuel. 164 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 consumption exhibit an increase. however, while the rise in per capita electricity intensity appears unquestionable, the data for heating show a sharp growth in nominal expenditure but the change in real expenditure is much more limited. indeed, two counteracting forces operated in the period considered: increasing gas prices and milder weather conditions, which also vary greatly over years and geographical areas in italy. it is worth stressing that the economic crisis seems to have hit households with the householder aged 65 or over less severely, probably because they can count on pension transfers and accumulated wealth. indeed, table 2 shows that between 1997 and 2013 the incidence of householders aged 60 and over spending more than 10% of their total expenditure on energy increased less than the average. however, there are some hints of a change in older householder consumption attitudes. as those who grew up during the world wars (and thus were influenced by a precautionary saving attitude) are progressively becoming fewer and those in good health more numerous, elderly italian people are starting to collect leisure-related electronic devices and also to improve their living standards by means of air conditioning equipment (table 3). it is evident that all the households belonging to the last three age classes were particularly active in adjusting to new consumer standards in the period observed. this switch in the consumer culture of the elderly in italy can also be confirmed for house-related investment, among which energy saving expenditure plays an important role. the empirical literature generally stresses that investment aimed at increasing energy efficiency is more common among younger generations and among households moving into new houses (see ramos et al., 2016 for the spanish case). table 3, on the contrary, shows that the share of elderly italian householders (those aged 65 or over) investing in property renovation – especially window fixture renovation – and solar panels is comparable to the overall average.12 this kind of expenditure – which is also a confirmation that an important share of elderly householders were less liquidityconstrained during the financial crisis – indicates a growing environmental awareness and greater importance assigned to environmental protection among elderly householders in italy, as has recently been shown by several surveys.13 5. determinants of residential energy expenditure in order to understand the joint effect of social and dwelling characteristicswe first run a set of pooled regressions, trying to disentangle the main drivers of energy demand by considering as dependent variable the total energy expenditure or its main components, i.e. expenditure on electricity and residential heating. briefly, the basic equation to be estimated is ln eeqit ð þ¼α0 þ βxit þ γyit þ uit ; ð1þ where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the household's deflated equivalent residential energy expenditure14 (either overall or on electricity or on heating), xit is the set of non-human characteristics (such as weather and dwelling size) and yit is the set of sociodemographic factors (or human characteristics). table 4 describes the variables employed in the equations. the dependent variables are grouped at the top of the list. table 3 percentages of households with property renovation, solar panels and air conditioning equipment by age class. householder age class

propensity to invest in solar panels is the youngest. this may be due to a more environmentally friendly attitude or to a greater familiarity with new technology. 13 the eurobarometer detailed database reports data on the attitude towards the environment by age classes for all eu countries. see european commission (2014) for a general overview. 14 nominal variables have been converted to real values using commodity-specific price indexes (base year 2010). moreover, in order tomake household expenditure comparable with different demographic compositions we use an equivalence scale which divides household income by the square root of household size. the square root scale, adopted in recent oecd works (oecd, 2013), implies that a household of four persons has needs twice as large as one composed of a single person.we use an age-neutral equivalence scale becausewewant to highlight the age effect in the regression. however, alternative equivalence scales have been tested and the empirical results of our analysis have proven to be robust to all alternatives. table 2 residential energy expenditure by householder age class. age classes resid. energy share over total consumpt.

energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 165 table 5 presents the regression results15 for the whole period (1997–2013). as a general outcome, we can observe that the main findings of the international empirical literature are also confirmed for italian households. the first column of table 5 presents the regression resultswhen household equivalent total residential energy expenditure is the dependent variable. regarding socio-demographic drivers, a positive link between age and energy expenditure is confirmed, as is the fact that women need more thermal comfort, so woman householders are associated with higher energy expenditure.more in details, the effect of the different age classes on regression has been shown through age dummies, so highlighting that the effect is nonlinear.16 the total household consumption level – as a proxy for household income level – has a clear and positive link with energy consumption. the regression results also confirm that high education levels are associated with lower consumption,17 whereas employment status appears not to be relevant in this case. household equivalent energy expenditure is higher the greater the dwelling size and the lower the household size, thus confirming the importance of economies of scale. due to the different atmospheric temperature level, overall energy expenditure is higher in the north and in the centre of italy, whereas air conditioning has a positive effect because of the electricity component in overall energy expenditure. dwelling age has a positive coefficient because of the greater square footage of older buildings and less powerful energy saving technologies embedded in historical dwellings; however, a significant coefficient can only be found for more recent buildings. dwelling types and heating types exhibit a clear influence on energy expenditure: detached houses and independent heating systems are linked to higher energy expenditure.18 not surprisingly, non-ordinary maintenance expenditure exhibits a negative sign, an indication that recent non-ordinary dwelling-related investments are linked to energy saving goals. in contrast with other international estimations, residential energy expenditure is higher if the householder is also the owner of the dwelling,19 probably an indication of a positive wealth effect. table 5 pooled ols regressions (1997–2013).

are clustered by year. 16 householders belonging to age class “40–44” have been chosen as reference group so this class has been excluded from estimation. 17 a positive influence of education level on energy saving behaviour has been widely found in the literature. however, mills and schleich (2012) find that this impact varies greatly among countries. 18 unlike other countries, in italy central heating – here defined as a unique heating system for all the flats composing the same building - is not the norm: more than 70% of dwelling have an independent (i.e. single family) heating system. see brounen et al. (2012) for the danish case. 19 of the 22million households in italy on census in 2011, about 80% were owner occupied and the residual 20% were rented. the share of owner occupied households is higher in italy with respect to other eu countries due to a higher household saving rate and to a greater propensity towards home ownership. table 4 definition of variables. variable name type notes househ.

166 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 the equivalent electricity expenditure estimation has similar results in terms of coefficient size and magnitude (table 5, second column). however, some interesting differences can be found: the geographical location dummies show an opposite effect because household electricity needs are greatly affected by cooling and air conditioning so that households located in the north and in the centre have lower electricity expenditure levels. the householder age variables also exhibit a clear nonlinear path. coefficients are increasing with age, but at declining rate after the age of 60, probably a sign that electricity consumption needs are more similar across age profiles than in studies covering previous decades, as found by hamza and gilroy (2011). on the contrary, dwelling age does not influence electricity expenditure. as heating is the main component of residential energy costs, the estimated coefficients for heating expenditure are very similar to those for overall energy expenditure, as is shown by the third column in table 5. 6. energy consumption profiles: the life cycle and generations the empirical analysis presented in the previous section has the aim of investigating consumer choices at specific ages for different groups of households. consumption behaviour at different ages for the same cohort cannot be analysed because in repeated cross-sections families are not followed over time as in panel data. to obtain this research perspective, birth cohorts must become the unit of analysis: generations encounter different historical and social conditions as they age and therefore it is reasonable for themto have diverse behavioural attitudes. cohort analysis is crucial for inference about age-period-cohort (apc) effects. age effects represent aging-related changes in behaviour and are common to many issues, including consumption choices. cohort effects reflect similarities in experiences and social influences across a particular generation that affect itsmembers' choices. finally, all cohorts may be affected by macro shocks, period effects that synchronously but temporarily move all cohorts away from their profiles. a first insight into the interaction between these effects is given in fig. 3, which shows the cross-sectional age profiles of (constant-price) energy consumption for selected years. each curve plots the average residential energy expenditure of all households with heads of the same age against the head's age.20 if we look at average consumption levels by age, we observe that each curve is hump-shaped, rising from the age of 25 to 50 and declining thereafter. therefore, these survey data confirm a standard finding in the literature (see meier and rehdanz, 2010 for the british case): household residential energy expenditures show a peak when the household head is about 50 years old and the family has reached its largest size, and then it decreases as the youngsters move out and the household's members become older. if we compare these curves across time, we observe that real consumption growth raised these profiles from 2002 to 2006. later, the economic crisis resulted in a fall in household energy expenditure, so the 2008 consumption profile is below that of 2002. after an increase in energy expenditure in 2010, the 2013 cross-sectional profile is well below the profiles for all previous years. as previously mentioned, this figure also shows that the effect of the crisis is less noticeable for families with older household heads as the average energy expenditures for all the years for this group are closer to each other. the main point here is to distinguish between a pure age effect and a cohort effect on energy expenditure. the cohort effects prohibit a cross-sectional consumption profile frombeing considered a lifecycle age-related profile. in fact, consumption behaviour includes an age effect, which is the characteristic life-cycle profile of the variable, and a cohort effect that leads to differences in the position of age profiles for different cohorts. if these differences exist, it is not correct to extrapolate from cross-sectional data information about the lifecycle consumption of an individual household. although economic analysis based on survey data has its advantages because of the wide variety of household characteristics in the sample, it has limits too because we are not looking across ages at the same cohort of households, but at the experience at different ages of different generations. however, with a time series of cross sections, it is still possible to follow cohorts of families from one survey to another. tracking different cohorts through successive surveys allows us to disentangle the generational from the life-cycle components in consumption profiles. in order to do this, we need to construct cohort data or pseudo-panel data. these semi-aggregated data provide a link between the microeconomic household-level data and the macroeconomic data from national accounts. then it is possible to use these cohort data to apply a decomposition into age, cohort, and year effects. this technique is commonly used to test the life-cycle fig. 3. cross-sectional household energy expenditure profiles. 20 the stepwise shape of the curves is because the consumption profiles are presented according to age classes. r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 167 theory of consumption.21 here, we use this decomposition as a device to verify our hypothesis of an age and a cohort effect overlapping in energy-related consumption behaviour. 6.1. building cohort data the use of pseudo-panel data was introduced by deaton (1985), who suggested forming cohort-level data if repeated cross sections are available. a cohort is defined as “a group with fixed membership, individuals of which can be identified as they show up in the surveys” (deaton 1985, p. 109). the main assumption behind the construction of a pseudo-panel is that units sharing the same time-invariant characteristics – and therefore allocated to the same cohort – have similar behaviour and can consequently be treated as a single unit. an additional hypothesis is that the cohort population is assumed to be constant.22 therefore, the possibility that migration, aging and death can change its composition over time is excluded. however, more serious difficulties come when the data are only collected at the household level and we define cohorts of households by the age of the head. this choice creates problems because households are not permanent; they change with divorces, remarriages and older people going to live with their children. therefore, old households in some surveys may become young households in others (deaton, 1997). although in pseudo-panels microeconomic heterogeneity is reduced, they have some advantages over genuine panels. first, the wide availability of cross-sectional data allows researchers to build pseudo-panels covering substantially longer periods than those that can be covered by real panels. moreover, pseudo-panels are also substantially larger in the number of units that they cover. finally, pseudo-panel data tend to deal with the attrition problem which is suffered by genuine panels. in cohort data, the exit and entry of new units is allowed while the nature of the panel data over time is maintained. the definition of cohorts creates a trade-off between the number of observations per cohort and the number of cohorts. indeed, if the first dimension is favoured over the second, there is a risk of grouping individuals with heterogeneous behaviour in the same cohort. conversely, if a large number of cohorts is designed to preserve variability within the panel, there is the risk of obtaining a very low number of observations for each cohort, thus leading to inconsistent estimates (nijman and verbeek, 1992; verbeek, 2008). in this paper, the cohorts are built by the date of birth of the household head, or more conveniently by his/ her age in 1997, which is the first year of our dataset. as shown below, the number of cohorts and the cell sizes are chosen to guarantee that sample cohort averages are reliable estimates of the population cohortmeans. as previously explained, our data come from seventeen independent cross sections of the italian household budget survey conducted by istat for the period 1997–2013. the key variables of interest are household equivalent real expenditure on electricity and heating, calculated following the preliminary operations previously discussed for pooled regressions. in addition, extreme and unreliable values are cleaned from the dataset through a trimming procedure that excludes observations falling outside the first and last percentiles. to construct the pseudo-panel for our analysis, we only keep households in which the head is 25–81 years old. this truncation eliminates those below 25, because there were very few household heads so young, and those above 81 to avoid a selectivity problem. for each survey, we average the expenditure by the age of the head and then track the sample from the same cohort one year older in the next survey.23 for example, we look at the average expenditure of 30-year-olds in the 1997 survey, of 31-year-olds in the 1998 survey and so on. we build and use cohorts at each age and therefore we end up with 73 cohorts: the youngest of these is 25 years old in 2013; the oldest is 65 years old in 1997. for each commodity we have a stacked vector of cohort-year observations of mean cohort expenditure.24 table 6 describes the cohorts and gives the cell size and average energy consumption in 1997 for a selection of cohorts (every fifth cohort for the sake of simplicity). the table reveals that the cell size in the first year of our data is lower for the youngest and the oldest cohorts. the explanation for the youngest cohort is simply that 25-year-olds are less likely to be household heads than older people. obviously, the cell size for this cohort increases up to 2013 because the group of 41-year-old household heads is more numerous. for the last cohort, mortality is the cause of the cell size decrease. for the middle years of household headship, the variation in sample size is limited, both because there are more households and because the selection problems are less severe. we show the energy expenditures of the cohorts in fig. 4. the first line segment – labelled ‘1’ – connects the average consumption of those who are 25 years old in 1997 to the average consumption of 26-year-olds in 1998, until the last observation of the cohort in 2013, when the householders are 41 years old. the following line segments repeat the exercise for those who are five years older, up to the last cohort considered in this graph – those born in 1932, labelled ‘9’. in this graph, a visible life-cycle pattern can be observed, rising with age and then falling after a peak around the age of 50.with few exceptions at older ages, the lines for the younger cohorts are very often but not always above the lines for the older cohorts, even when they are observed at the same age, i.e. when the cohorts overlap. this is the cohort effect. however,we also observe a great deal ofwithin-cohort movements. some of these may be explained by a common macroeconomic shock, which is perhaps the hardest to see in this graph. note that each connected line segment corresponds to the same contemporaneous span of 17 years, 1997–2013. each cohort shows a slowdown in the early 2000s, then a double-dip fall in 2007 and 2010 corresponding to the economic crisis and to the sovereign-debt european crisis. this is an example of year effect, i.e. an aggregate effect that synchronously but temporarily moves all the cohorts away from their profiles, in this case a fall in the economic growth rate. a deeper analysis of this figure requires us to distinguish three effects: age, cohort, and year effects. in order to do this, we apply a decomposition procedure to separate the three components. 6.2. age, cohort and year effects: a decomposition in order to estimate the decomposition of effects,we can regress the cohort consumption averages against dummy variables for all three sets 21 see deaton and paxson (1994), jappelli (1999) and jappelli andmodigliani (1998). for a previous application on italian household consumption items see bardazzi (2001). 22 “an assumption that is needed if the successive surveys are to generate randomsamples from the same underlying population.” deaton (1997), p.121. 23 for the years 2002–2013 the age variable is aggregated in classes. to construct cohorts with previous years' data where exact age is available, we assume that individuals of all ages within each class have the average consumption level of that class. 24 in fact, we work with the means of the logarithm of expenditure. table 6 selected cohorts and average expenditure. cohort year of birth age of cohort in

economics 65 (2017) 161–171 of effects. obviously, other restrictions could be used such as polynomials, but with plentiful data we can use dummy variables and thus allow the data to choose any pattern. the model can be written as y ¼ β þ aα þ cγ þ yψ þ u; ð2þ where y is the stacked vector of observations, a is a matrix of age dummies, c a matrix of cohort dummies, and y a matrix of year dummies.25 we must drop one column from each of the three matrices of dummies to avoid singularity. however, it is still impossible to estimate this regression because of an additional linear relationship across age, cohort and year. that is, if we decide to label cohorts c as the age of the household head in year t = 0 and t refers to the date, we can infer the cohort's age a as a ¼ c þ t ð3þ therefore, it is necessary to impose another restriction to obtain the normalisation effects. there are several possible alternatives and each of them implies different results. this identification problem is wellknown in the literature and alternative normalisation methods have been proposed (among others, by mckenzie, 2006; schulhofer-wohl, 2013; yang et al., 2008). all these approaches have their shortcomings and their increased generality comes at the cost of increased technical complexity. one of themost common normalisations imposes the constraint that year dummy coefficients are orthogonal to a time-trend and sumto zero (deaton and paxson, 1994). to understand this approach, we can consider an example of a variable, say consumption, growing at 5% for each year for each cohort. this growth can be represented by a time trend of 5% a year in the year effects,without either cohort or age effects, or by age effects that rise linearly with age added to cohort effects that fall linearly with age. note that these two effects are equal (5%) but of opposite sign because the cohorts are labelled by age at a fixed date, so that the older cohorts (larger c) are poorer, not richer. in our case, where energy consumption is the variable to be decomposed, it seems reasonable to attribute all the trends observable in the data to age and cohort effects, not time, and to use the year effects to capture cyclical fluctuations that average to zero over the long run. the simplest way to implement this normalisation is to estimate the model with the first age group, and the seventeenth cohort omitted, so that the reference group is that of a household headed by a 25-year-old in 1997. the year dummies are constrained to be orthogonal to a time trend and to add up to zero.26 6.3. empirical results we apply this decomposition to the energy expenditure of the households grouped into two categories: electricity and heating fuels. the results of the decomposition of age and cohort effects are presented in figs. 5 and 6; the estimated parameters and the statistics of themodel are shown in the appendix. for these energy expenditure items, two graphswith four panels are presented. the first plot shows the average of logged consumption for every fifth cohort. the other three panels show the age effects, the cohort effects (plotted as a function of the age of the household head in 1997), and the year effects respectively. all the effects are jointly statistically significant, with f-values in the case of electricity for age and cohort effects of 46.07 and 39.7 respectively, while the statistic is 112.78 for the period effects. in fig. 5, equivalent electricity expenditure rises with age, with a peak around the age of 55 and then flattening out at older ages. this life-cycle pattern is confirmed by the age effect, where the parameter rises from zero to 0.4 between ages 25 and 50 and then increases to 0.65 at age 80. the cohort effects (bottom lefthand panel) are of about the same magnitude as the age effects, and they steadily decline from younger to older generations. indeed, electricity consumption increases at about 1.2% per cohort so that, for example, the expenditure at age 50 of someone born in 1963 is on average 20% higher than the expenditure at the same age of someone born in 1947. the year effects (bottom right-hand panel) appear multi-peaked and seem to reproduce the economic cycle. 25 in our case, all thematrices havemrows,which is the number of cohort-year pairs for each commodity. the number of columns is 57 (the number of ages) formatrix a, 73 (the number of cohorts) for c, and 17 (the number of years) for y. 26 consider dt as the usual zero-one dummy. to enforce this restriction, we use a set of t-2 year dummies, dt *, defined as follows, from t = 3,… t dt ¼ dt−½t−1d2−t−2d1 fig. 4. energy expenditure by cohort. r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 169 similar conclusions can be drawn for heating fuel expenditure (fig. 6). in this case too, the age, cohort and period effects are significant.27 equivalent heating expenditure shows a steadily increasing age effect, and the effect is steeper before the age of forty. the magnitude of age effects is larger than in the case of electricity, with an average increase of 1.8% per year. as regards cohort effects, younger generations clearly have increased heating expenditure and this is particularly true for the cohort of those born in the 1970s. in general, for both energy expenditure categories we may roughly divide the 73 cohorts into two groups: the younger generations born between 1947 and 1988 and 27 the f-value for age, cohort and year effects is respectively 12.79, 8.79 and 47.07. the older generations born between fig. 6. cohort and age effects for equivalent heating fuel expenditure. fig. 5. cohort and age effects for equivalent electricity expenditure. 170 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 1916 and 1946. for the younger generations, the cohort effect coefficients are between 0 and −0.2 for both energy categories, with no large inter-cohort difference in the pattern of spending. intuitively, the younger cohort grew up in the post-war period, a time of relative peace and economic growth. for the older generation, the cohort effects clearly show that cohorts born earlier spend less while those born later spendmore (the coefficients drop from−0.2 to−1.08 for heating fuels and −0.7 for electricity). most of these cohorts lived through the war and their spending attitudes were influenced by the experience. 7. concluding remarks the economics literature almost universally predicts that an aging population will increase household energy consumption demand: older households spend more on energy, and especially heating energy, because their members are at home for a larger proportion of the day and they usually need more heating comfort. however, this causal link is more complex than expected because of the different pressures exerted by socio-demographic transformations (longer life expectancy and smaller family size), economic transformations (welfare state retrenchment, changes in job market, income distribution), changes in lifestyle and environmental attitudes, and last but not least global warming. in this paper we have found evidence that in italy population aging can produce an even gloomier scenario: besides traditional drivers of energy demand – income, demographics and dwelling characteristics – the cohort effect interplays with the age effect to increase energy consumption in newer generations. indeed, by building cohort data for italian households, we have decomposed and estimated significant positive age and negative cohort effects. younger generations boost energy consumption because they have higher residential energy expenditure than the oldest cohorts observed. according to stephenson et al. (2015), different social norms, including individual expectations and aspirations, interplay with material culture and energy practices in shaping individual behaviour, subject to the external influences, which form the context where energy cultures develop. we have found hints of different energy culture clusters in consumption attitudes: the war generation (attached to the idea of scarcity of goods and energy dependency) and the baby-boom generation – people currently aged 55 and over – which grew up during the golden age of italian development and is characterized by a technology-friendly attitude. a growing number of elderly people in italy seem to be in a position to access goods associated with comfort and leisure – among which electronic equipment and digital connectivity play a key role – so a more active lifestyle and therefore a new energy culture call for greater electricity demand. the energy culture of new italian generations also seems more strictly linked to thermal comfort (heating and air conditioning) than to energy-saving attitudes and so an aging population also means more residential energy demand. in other words, a change in economic culture across generations is shaping a more energy-intensive consumption pattern, as is also signalled by the fact that the implementation of energy-saving technologies can only partially offset the change in energy-use behaviour at the country level (fig. 1). however, some factors can help to mitigate this alarming trend. on the one hand, a more active lifestyle for elderly people can potentially lead to smaller house occupancy. on the other hand, there are hints that elderly italian householders aremore concerned about the environment than is traditionally expected in the economics literature: our data showthat investment in residential solar energy equipment and household renovation is also common among the older age classes.moreover, several surveys – such as the recent eurobarometer waves – signal that environment protection is also increasingly perceived as a key priority among elderly people. public policies aimed at decreasing energy use are backed by the eu and have been implemented in all developed countries. besides economic instruments grounded on the signal of carbon price, we argue that policies specifically designed to shape energy cultures towards more sustainable behaviour – taking into account the different lifestyles and energy needs of overlapping generations – are crucial and can help italy to meet the energy-saving targets set at eu level. supplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2017.04.025. references bardazzi, r., 2001. cohort, age and year effects on italian household consumption. in: grassini, m.

fast demographic shift widely studied but generally undervalued by policymakers. population aging may imply smaller household sizes and more home-based energy consumption, which will change the energy mix. consumer preference shifts and different attitudes towards environment among the generations determine additional effects. study of the link between an aging population and energy demand is even more important for italy because its energy dependence is almost complete and its population is aging quickly. this paper aims to assess the role of changing generational preferences in the energy expenditure trend in italy by distinguishing between a pure age effect and a cohort effect. the decomposition shows significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, thus confirming that, beside an aging effect, we must consider that recent generations have a higher residential energy expenditure. indeed, the energy culture of post war italian generations seems more linked to thermal comfort (heating and air conditioning) than to environmental attitudes. © 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. keywords: energy consumption cohort effects pseudopanel data 1. introduction population aging is a long-term trend which began several decades ago in europe. the growth in the relative share of older people may be explained, among other things, by a rise in life expectancy, and specifically by an increase in life expectancy in good health. the share of elderly people in the total population will significantly increase in the near future as the post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement. this trend is particularly marked in italy, where the proportion of the population aged 65 and over (21% in 2014) is the highest among european countries and it is projected to rise further by 2050. the economic effects of an aging population have been extensively studied and following the pioneering contributions by ramsey and modigliani, life-cycle theory shows that aggregate consumption and savings are affected by the age structure of the population. in other words, the distribution of age groups among the population matters because households adapt consumption behaviour to the needs of different life-cycle phases. only recently has attention been devoted to the energy-related behaviour of different age groups: this is probably connected to awareness of climate change as the related literature agrees on the fact that an aging population may hinder public policy efforts to reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions.1 this alarm is linked to the fact that as a result of a less active lifestyle elderly people have a higher energy demand for heating and electricity. however, the picture is more complex than expected, and several factors – such as aggregate income trends, consumer preferences and societal transformation – may play roles with contradictory effects. setting aside the macroeconomic aggregate results of these counteracting forces, in this paper we stress the microeconomic perspective by looking at household heterogeneity in terms of age and generation. we use data drawn from the italian household budget survey to perform a pooled regression analysis and a study of cohort groups with the aim of disentangling age and cohort effects. the pooled analysis confirms the main findings in the international literature highlighting that dwelling and personal characteristics – among which age – are key factors explaining household residential energy demand. we then analyse how relevant the interplay between age and cohort effects is by applying the decomposition between cohort, age and year effects presented by deaton and paxson (1994). empirical evidence reveals significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, showing that expenditure rises with age, yet this pure age effect interplays with cultural factors which differ across generations. similarities in social experiences and cultural influences shape energy consumption energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 ⁎ corresponding author. e-mail addresses: rossella.bardazzi@unifi.it (r. bardazzi),

expenditure among generations than in heating expenditure. the paper is organized as follows. after a survey of the literature on the linkages between aging and energy consumption (section 2), section 3 briefly discusses the residential energy intensity of italian households. section 4 describes the dataset and in section 5 the results of a pooled regression analysis are discussed. the cohort analysis is introduced in section 6 and the results of the decomposition of age, period and cohort effects are presented. the final section contains our conclusions. 2. residential energy demand and an aging population: a survey of the related literature most of the international economics literature analysing residential energy consumption agrees on the fact that household energy demand is a combination of non-human (such as dwelling and weather conditions) and human characteristics, the latter including demographic, psychological and cultural elements. weather conditions and meteorological temperature levels are widely used as control variables in household energy demand models. indeed, a growing literature estimating the elasticity of energy demand to temperature variation has been trying to assess the global warming impact on heating and cooling expenditure.2 as expected, there is a negative link between temperature levels and heating-related energy demand, whereas a positive link is evident for cooling-related expenditure. however, there are non-linearities in this kind of relation due to both threshold effects and cultural components. by using dutch micro data, brounen et al. (2012) find that the characteristics of the dwelling are more relevant for gas and heating consumption whereas electricity consumption is more affected by demographic characteristics. moreover, they find that electricity is more sensitive to income fluctuations than gas consumption. they also document a strong relationship between the age and characteristics of dwellings (with detached houses using more energy) and their resource consumption. according to their estimates, recently built dwellings use about 65% less gas for heating than those constructed prior toworld war ii, due to improvements in construction technology and insulation, and this is especially true for those dwellings built after the oil shock. on the contrary, they find greater electricity consumption in post-war buildings and especially in those of recent construction. costas and kahn (2011) estimate a link between electricity consumption per dwelling and the electricity price at the time the building was built, because low electricity prices at the time of construction reduce the incentive to install energy efficient devices. therefore, consumers exhibit a time preference bias because they seem unable to take into consideration price changes. turning to socio-economic characteristics, several studies highlight the relevance of economies of scale with regard to residential energy use, so that household size is a key variable. economies of scale mean that small households use more energy per capita to maintain a certain level of energy-related services (heating, hot water, cooking facilities). ironmonger et al. (1995) estimate significant economies of scale in australian household energy use and expenditure on energy, with small differences among household types but clear evidence of diseconomies of scale for older households. this penalization of elderly households is linked to lower income levels and to smaller household size. householdswith higher levels of education tend to adoptmore environmentally friendly behaviours (torgler et al., 2008) and are perhaps more willing to reduce their carbon footprints. from another point of view, such individuals are more likely to fully consider energy saving cost reduction or to take advantage of energy saving tax incentives, so they aremore likely to insulate their homes or install energy production devices such as solar panels. longhi (2015) finds that in the uk those households where at least one member has a university degree spend on average about 2% per capita less on energy overall, but the impact is lower if pro-environmental attitudes are considered. this suggests that peoplewith higher education levelsmay bemore aware of environmental problems andmorewilling to adopt pro-environmental types of behaviour, even after controlling for household income. income level per se is important, but less relevant to predicting consumption heterogeneity than expected. income elasticity estimates vary widely among studies, with a tendency to be smaller when using microdata sets. as a general finding, elasticities are higher for heating-related than electricity expenditures. similarly, changes in household socio-economic circumstances (such as entering unemployment) translate into changes in energy consumption, but their impact is small compared to that of dwelling characteristics (on gas expenditure) and especially household size (longhi, 2015).3 homeownership is also important because it influences the propensity to invest in energy saving. however as meier and rehdanz (2010) and longhi (2015) document, uk homeowners seem to have a higher energy expenditure (7% more than households in rented houses, according to longhi, 2015), notwithstanding this greater propensity to invest in energy-saving measures. what about the interaction between household age structures – or more generally population aging – and these drivers of energy consumption? as a general finding, household energy consumption tends to change over the lifespan and an inverted u shape can be observedwhen considering household energy expenditure and average family age or householder age. this is due to a changing size and composition of the household, so that when the householder's age is between 40 and 60 there is the highest probability of there being overlapping generations in the house. in particular, aging is usually associatedwith higher energy expenditure and ghg emissions: older households spend more on energy, especially on heating, because they occupy houses for a larger proportion of the day and they usually need more heating comfort. aging can also have indirect impacts through an associated decline in household size and consequently a loss of economies of scale in energy use at the household level. the decrease in average household size is not a particular feature of aged people but can be considered a general pattern of modern society observable in almost all industrialized countries, among which italy. using a panel of japanese households, schröder et al. (2015) estimate that a 5% decline in average household size during the period 2005–10 resulted in forgone household economies of scale equivalent to a 3.5% increase in household-sector energy demand. this trend of declining household size therefore resolves in an upward pressure on total residential energy use that can be only partially offset by enhancing the efficiency of the home and its appliances. moreover, older households generally have lower income levels and this acts as a factor mitigating energy demand, but at the same time acts to further lower energy saving investment. what can consumer culture, which can be particular to different cohorts, add to this general analysis of physical and demographic characteristics? it is widely known that the traditional neo-classical assumptions of cost minimization provide a somewhat poor model for interpreting actual energy-related choices. energy consumption patterns vary greatly between apparently similar types of household, either when looking at cross-sectional data, or when considering different cohorts. this heterogeneity goes beyond bias and errors in evaluating costs and price signals,4 and can be better described by looking at characteristics of energy culture. according to stephenson et al. (2010), energy choices can be understood by looking at the interactions 2 for a cross country analysis, see petrick et al. (2012). 3 on this point, see espey and espey (2004). 4 the behavioural literature widely discusses the reasons for non-optimized energy demand behaviour, and especially regarding energy saving investment. on this topic, see maréchal (2010). 162 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 between “cognitive norms, (e.g. beliefs, understandings),material culture (e.g. technologies, building form) and energy practices (e.g. activities, processes).”5 energy culture standards are not immutable. on the contrary, new standards can be rapidly adopted and they can be shaped by prevalent behaviours in society as well as by technology availability. with better health and greater wealth than their parents' generation, newly retired people may be able to fulfil ambitions of leisure activities and travel. these newolder cohorts are likely to be in a position to access goods associated with comfort and leisure, among which electronic equipment and digital connectivity (including social networking) play a key role. a recent survey in the uk reveals that the spending share on leisure goods is relatively similar across age groups, whereas for leisure services to be used outside the home only the oldest pensioners (aged over 80) spend notably less (hamza and gilroy, 2011). carlsson- kanyama et al. (2005) conclude that generationsmatterwhen residential energy consumption is considered. they find “differences in housing standards, consumption and environmental behaviour between generations born during the 1940s compared to those born in the 1950s, 1960s and later….”6 and they link this effect to the different stages of development of the swedish economy, which after the war world ii period of shortage of goods entered the ‘consumer society’ in the sixties. it can be said that generations are characterized by common consumer experiences,which in turn define future consumption patterns. the links between the main human/non-human characteristics and residential energy demand are summarized in the first column of fig. 1. 5 stephenson et al. (2010), p. 6124. 6 carlsson-kanyama et al. (2005), p. 250. fig. 1. interacting forces on residential energy demand. r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 163 in the second column, some issues raised by an aging population are highlighted. 3. italian residential energy intensity: the end of energy-saving primacy? despite italy having one of the lowest levels of energy intensity, both at the gdp and household consumption levels, progress has slowed down and at the moment the energy efficiency targets set at the eu level seem beyond any concrete possibility. the structural low level of energy intensity can be attributed to a number of factors, including the mild mediterranean climate, the structure of economic activities and the traditional high energy dependency, which in turn causes high energy prices.7 the already-good energy efficiency of italian households further improved by 10% over the period 2000–2012, compared to the eu average of 19%. this relatively slow progress was mainly linked to a mix of further increases in energy prices and public incentives to promote energy-saving maintenance for buildings and fixtures. regarding electricity use, italian families increased their consumption by 2.2% over the same timespan, whereas at the eu level only a 1.3% increasewas recorded. this difference is due to lower energy-saving results for italy. looking at space heating, the eu and italy exhibit opposite trends. on average, eu citizens reduced the amount of energy used for space heating thanks to more energy efficiency and a change in their heating attitudes. italy, on the contrary, showed an increase in energy consumption connected to an increase in the number of dwellings and to a change in heating behaviour that energy saving and the milder climate could not compensate for (fig. 2). 4. the data in order to understand the relative importance of energy demand drivers, we use data on household expenditure collected through the household budget survey (ihbs) published by the italian statistical office (istat). altogether, some 22,000 households are sampled throughout the year to represent the italian population at the regional level. beside sociodemographic characteristics, the survey collects information about expenditure on household goods and services.8 our analysis uses observations for the period 1997–2013, and therefore includes the years of economic downturn after 2007. the survey is designed as a repeated cross section so it is not possible to look at the behaviour of the same individuals over time, but different ages in different groups of households can be observed. a cross-sectional analysis of energy expenditure is useful to provide an idea of how households with different characteristics compare, but it is difficult to disentangle structural heterogeneity and behavioural differences or changes. the dataset contains data on energy expenditure, dwelling characteristics and sociodemographic factors formore than 20,000 households each year.households are grouped according to the head's year of birth9 using five-year age classes.10 as we are interested in distinguishing energy demand by age, table 1 reports data on weighted frequencies and on household size by age class at the beginning and end of the period observed. the table highlights how profoundly demographic trends are shaping the population structure in italy: the share of households with the householder aged 65 or over was 30.7% in 1997 and became 35.5% in 2013 (18.8% for those aged 75 or over). at the same time, we can also observe a sharp increase in household numbers (more than 4 million) and a decrease in the average family size (from 2.7 in 1997 to 2.3 in 2013). as is generally agreed, a smaller household size means a loss of economies of scale and greater vulnerability to fuel poverty. table 2 shows a clear increase in the share of residential energy expenditure in total consumption expenditure, from an average of 5.7% in 1997 to 6.3% in 2013. this share increases linearly with age class, confirming the hypothesis that elderly people need more thermal comfort and spend more on heating. as faiella and lavecchia (2015) discuss, an energy share level above 6% represents a historical peak and it is the result of two factors: a greater increase in energy price indexes with respect to the overall consumption price index and the effect of the financial crisis on average income and total expenditure.11 during the period observed, both overall per capita heating and electricity 7 an in-depth analysis of energy intensity and the structure of energy prices in italy – which include a considerable share of taxes and quasi-taxes to finance a renewable incentive system – can be found in

person as indicated in the civil registry. householders under 18 have been excluded from our dataset. 10 the microdata released only report the age of household members as a continuous variable for the years 1997–2001. since 2002, istat has adopted a new methodology to protect the privacy of the individuals surveyed. therefore, for the years 2002–2013 the age variable is aggregated into 15 classes (0–5; 6–14; 15–17, 18–24; 25–29; 30–34; 35– 39; 40–44; 45–49; 50–54; 55–59; 60–64; 65–69; 70–74; and 75 and over). 11 although themeasurement of fuel poverty is a key research issuewith several indicators being used in the literature (see faiella and lavecchia, 2015), in table 2 a very rough measure is shown. a household is considered ‘fuel poor’ if the family spends more than 10% of its total expenditure on fuel. 164 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 consumption exhibit an increase. however, while the rise in per capita electricity intensity appears unquestionable, the data for heating show a sharp growth in nominal expenditure but the change in real expenditure is much more limited. indeed, two counteracting forces operated in the period considered: increasing gas prices and milder weather conditions, which also vary greatly over years and geographical areas in italy. it is worth stressing that the economic crisis seems to have hit households with the householder aged 65 or over less severely, probably because they can count on pension transfers and accumulated wealth. indeed, table 2 shows that between 1997 and 2013 the incidence of householders aged 60 and over spending more than 10% of their total expenditure on energy increased less than the average. however, there are some hints of a change in older householder consumption attitudes. as those who grew up during the world wars (and thus were influenced by a precautionary saving attitude) are progressively becoming fewer and those in good health more numerous, elderly italian people are starting to collect leisure-related electronic devices and also to improve their living standards by means of air conditioning equipment (table 3). it is evident that all the households belonging to the last three age classes were particularly active in adjusting to new consumer standards in the period observed. this switch in the consumer culture of the elderly in italy can also be confirmed for house-related investment, among which energy saving expenditure plays an important role. the empirical literature generally stresses that investment aimed at increasing energy efficiency is more common among younger generations and among households moving into new houses (see ramos et al., 2016 for the spanish case). table 3, on the contrary, shows that the share of elderly italian householders (those aged 65 or over) investing in property renovation – especially window fixture renovation – and solar panels is comparable to the overall average.12 this kind of expenditure – which is also a confirmation that an important share of elderly householders were less liquidityconstrained during the financial crisis – indicates a growing environmental awareness and greater importance assigned to environmental protection among elderly householders in italy, as has recently been shown by several surveys.13 5. determinants of residential energy expenditure in order to understand the joint effect of social and dwelling characteristicswe first run a set of pooled regressions, trying to disentangle the main drivers of energy demand by considering as dependent variable the total energy expenditure or its main components, i.e. expenditure on electricity and residential heating. briefly, the basic equation to be estimated is ln eeqit ð þ¼α0 þ βxit þ γyit þ uit ; ð1þ where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the household's deflated equivalent residential energy expenditure14 (either overall or on electricity or on heating), xit is the set of non-human characteristics (such as weather and dwelling size) and yit is the set of sociodemographic factors (or human characteristics). table 4 describes the variables employed in the equations. the dependent variables are grouped at the top of the list. table 3 percentages of households with property renovation, solar panels and air conditioning equipment by age class. householder age class

propensity to invest in solar panels is the youngest. this may be due to a more environmentally friendly attitude or to a greater familiarity with new technology. 13 the eurobarometer detailed database reports data on the attitude towards the environment by age classes for all eu countries. see european commission (2014) for a general overview. 14 nominal variables have been converted to real values using commodity-specific price indexes (base year 2010). moreover, in order tomake household expenditure comparable with different demographic compositions we use an equivalence scale which divides household income by the square root of household size. the square root scale, adopted in recent oecd works (oecd, 2013), implies that a household of four persons has needs twice as large as one composed of a single person.we use an age-neutral equivalence scale becausewewant to highlight the age effect in the regression. however, alternative equivalence scales have been tested and the empirical results of our analysis have proven to be robust to all alternatives. table 2 residential energy expenditure by householder age class. age classes resid. energy share over total consumpt.

energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 165 table 5 presents the regression results15 for the whole period (1997–2013). as a general outcome, we can observe that the main findings of the international empirical literature are also confirmed for italian households. the first column of table 5 presents the regression resultswhen household equivalent total residential energy expenditure is the dependent variable. regarding socio-demographic drivers, a positive link between age and energy expenditure is confirmed, as is the fact that women need more thermal comfort, so woman householders are associated with higher energy expenditure.more in details, the effect of the different age classes on regression has been shown through age dummies, so highlighting that the effect is nonlinear.16 the total household consumption level – as a proxy for household income level – has a clear and positive link with energy consumption. the regression results also confirm that high education levels are associated with lower consumption,17 whereas employment status appears not to be relevant in this case. household equivalent energy expenditure is higher the greater the dwelling size and the lower the household size, thus confirming the importance of economies of scale. due to the different atmospheric temperature level, overall energy expenditure is higher in the north and in the centre of italy, whereas air conditioning has a positive effect because of the electricity component in overall energy expenditure. dwelling age has a positive coefficient because of the greater square footage of older buildings and less powerful energy saving technologies embedded in historical dwellings; however, a significant coefficient can only be found for more recent buildings. dwelling types and heating types exhibit a clear influence on energy expenditure: detached houses and independent heating systems are linked to higher energy expenditure.18 not surprisingly, non-ordinary maintenance expenditure exhibits a negative sign, an indication that recent non-ordinary dwelling-related investments are linked to energy saving goals. in contrast with other international estimations, residential energy expenditure is higher if the householder is also the owner of the dwelling,19 probably an indication of a positive wealth effect. table 5 pooled ols regressions (1997–2013).

are clustered by year. 16 householders belonging to age class “40–44” have been chosen as reference group so this class has been excluded from estimation. 17 a positive influence of education level on energy saving behaviour has been widely found in the literature. however, mills and schleich (2012) find that this impact varies greatly among countries. 18 unlike other countries, in italy central heating – here defined as a unique heating system for all the flats composing the same building - is not the norm: more than 70% of dwelling have an independent (i.e. single family) heating system. see brounen et al. (2012) for the danish case. 19 of the 22million households in italy on census in 2011, about 80% were owner occupied and the residual 20% were rented. the share of owner occupied households is higher in italy with respect to other eu countries due to a higher household saving rate and to a greater propensity towards home ownership. table 4 definition of variables. variable name type notes househ.

166 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 the equivalent electricity expenditure estimation has similar results in terms of coefficient size and magnitude (table 5, second column). however, some interesting differences can be found: the geographical location dummies show an opposite effect because household electricity needs are greatly affected by cooling and air conditioning so that households located in the north and in the centre have lower electricity expenditure levels. the householder age variables also exhibit a clear nonlinear path. coefficients are increasing with age, but at declining rate after the age of 60, probably a sign that electricity consumption needs are more similar across age profiles than in studies covering previous decades, as found by hamza and gilroy (2011). on the contrary, dwelling age does not influence electricity expenditure. as heating is the main component of residential energy costs, the estimated coefficients for heating expenditure are very similar to those for overall energy expenditure, as is shown by the third column in table 5. 6. energy consumption profiles: the life cycle and generations the empirical analysis presented in the previous section has the aim of investigating consumer choices at specific ages for different groups of households. consumption behaviour at different ages for the same cohort cannot be analysed because in repeated cross-sections families are not followed over time as in panel data. to obtain this research perspective, birth cohorts must become the unit of analysis: generations encounter different historical and social conditions as they age and therefore it is reasonable for themto have diverse behavioural attitudes. cohort analysis is crucial for inference about age-period-cohort (apc) effects. age effects represent aging-related changes in behaviour and are common to many issues, including consumption choices. cohort effects reflect similarities in experiences and social influences across a particular generation that affect itsmembers' choices. finally, all cohorts may be affected by macro shocks, period effects that synchronously but temporarily move all cohorts away from their profiles. a first insight into the interaction between these effects is given in fig. 3, which shows the cross-sectional age profiles of (constant-price) energy consumption for selected years. each curve plots the average residential energy expenditure of all households with heads of the same age against the head's age.20 if we look at average consumption levels by age, we observe that each curve is hump-shaped, rising from the age of 25 to 50 and declining thereafter. therefore, these survey data confirm a standard finding in the literature (see meier and rehdanz, 2010 for the british case): household residential energy expenditures show a peak when the household head is about 50 years old and the family has reached its largest size, and then it decreases as the youngsters move out and the household's members become older. if we compare these curves across time, we observe that real consumption growth raised these profiles from 2002 to 2006. later, the economic crisis resulted in a fall in household energy expenditure, so the 2008 consumption profile is below that of 2002. after an increase in energy expenditure in 2010, the 2013 cross-sectional profile is well below the profiles for all previous years. as previously mentioned, this figure also shows that the effect of the crisis is less noticeable for families with older household heads as the average energy expenditures for all the years for this group are closer to each other. the main point here is to distinguish between a pure age effect and a cohort effect on energy expenditure. the cohort effects prohibit a cross-sectional consumption profile frombeing considered a lifecycle age-related profile. in fact, consumption behaviour includes an age effect, which is the characteristic life-cycle profile of the variable, and a cohort effect that leads to differences in the position of age profiles for different cohorts. if these differences exist, it is not correct to extrapolate from cross-sectional data information about the lifecycle consumption of an individual household. although economic analysis based on survey data has its advantages because of the wide variety of household characteristics in the sample, it has limits too because we are not looking across ages at the same cohort of households, but at the experience at different ages of different generations. however, with a time series of cross sections, it is still possible to follow cohorts of families from one survey to another. tracking different cohorts through successive surveys allows us to disentangle the generational from the life-cycle components in consumption profiles. in order to do this, we need to construct cohort data or pseudo-panel data. these semi-aggregated data provide a link between the microeconomic household-level data and the macroeconomic data from national accounts. then it is possible to use these cohort data to apply a decomposition into age, cohort, and year effects. this technique is commonly used to test the life-cycle fig. 3. cross-sectional household energy expenditure profiles. 20 the stepwise shape of the curves is because the consumption profiles are presented according to age classes. r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 167 theory of consumption.21 here, we use this decomposition as a device to verify our hypothesis of an age and a cohort effect overlapping in energy-related consumption behaviour. 6.1. building cohort data the use of pseudo-panel data was introduced by deaton (1985), who suggested forming cohort-level data if repeated cross sections are available. a cohort is defined as “a group with fixed membership, individuals of which can be identified as they show up in the surveys” (deaton 1985, p. 109). the main assumption behind the construction of a pseudo-panel is that units sharing the same time-invariant characteristics – and therefore allocated to the same cohort – have similar behaviour and can consequently be treated as a single unit. an additional hypothesis is that the cohort population is assumed to be constant.22 therefore, the possibility that migration, aging and death can change its composition over time is excluded. however, more serious difficulties come when the data are only collected at the household level and we define cohorts of households by the age of the head. this choice creates problems because households are not permanent; they change with divorces, remarriages and older people going to live with their children. therefore, old households in some surveys may become young households in others (deaton, 1997). although in pseudo-panels microeconomic heterogeneity is reduced, they have some advantages over genuine panels. first, the wide availability of cross-sectional data allows researchers to build pseudo-panels covering substantially longer periods than those that can be covered by real panels. moreover, pseudo-panels are also substantially larger in the number of units that they cover. finally, pseudo-panel data tend to deal with the attrition problem which is suffered by genuine panels. in cohort data, the exit and entry of new units is allowed while the nature of the panel data over time is maintained. the definition of cohorts creates a trade-off between the number of observations per cohort and the number of cohorts. indeed, if the first dimension is favoured over the second, there is a risk of grouping individuals with heterogeneous behaviour in the same cohort. conversely, if a large number of cohorts is designed to preserve variability within the panel, there is the risk of obtaining a very low number of observations for each cohort, thus leading to inconsistent estimates (nijman and verbeek, 1992; verbeek, 2008). in this paper, the cohorts are built by the date of birth of the household head, or more conveniently by his/ her age in 1997, which is the first year of our dataset. as shown below, the number of cohorts and the cell sizes are chosen to guarantee that sample cohort averages are reliable estimates of the population cohortmeans. as previously explained, our data come from seventeen independent cross sections of the italian household budget survey conducted by istat for the period 1997–2013. the key variables of interest are household equivalent real expenditure on electricity and heating, calculated following the preliminary operations previously discussed for pooled regressions. in addition, extreme and unreliable values are cleaned from the dataset through a trimming procedure that excludes observations falling outside the first and last percentiles. to construct the pseudo-panel for our analysis, we only keep households in which the head is 25–81 years old. this truncation eliminates those below 25, because there were very few household heads so young, and those above 81 to avoid a selectivity problem. for each survey, we average the expenditure by the age of the head and then track the sample from the same cohort one year older in the next survey.23 for example, we look at the average expenditure of 30-year-olds in the 1997 survey, of 31-year-olds in the 1998 survey and so on. we build and use cohorts at each age and therefore we end up with 73 cohorts: the youngest of these is 25 years old in 2013; the oldest is 65 years old in 1997. for each commodity we have a stacked vector of cohort-year observations of mean cohort expenditure.24 table 6 describes the cohorts and gives the cell size and average energy consumption in 1997 for a selection of cohorts (every fifth cohort for the sake of simplicity). the table reveals that the cell size in the first year of our data is lower for the youngest and the oldest cohorts. the explanation for the youngest cohort is simply that 25-year-olds are less likely to be household heads than older people. obviously, the cell size for this cohort increases up to 2013 because the group of 41-year-old household heads is more numerous. for the last cohort, mortality is the cause of the cell size decrease. for the middle years of household headship, the variation in sample size is limited, both because there are more households and because the selection problems are less severe. we show the energy expenditures of the cohorts in fig. 4. the first line segment – labelled ‘1’ – connects the average consumption of those who are 25 years old in 1997 to the average consumption of 26-year-olds in 1998, until the last observation of the cohort in 2013, when the householders are 41 years old. the following line segments repeat the exercise for those who are five years older, up to the last cohort considered in this graph – those born in 1932, labelled ‘9’. in this graph, a visible life-cycle pattern can be observed, rising with age and then falling after a peak around the age of 50.with few exceptions at older ages, the lines for the younger cohorts are very often but not always above the lines for the older cohorts, even when they are observed at the same age, i.e. when the cohorts overlap. this is the cohort effect. however,we also observe a great deal ofwithin-cohort movements. some of these may be explained by a common macroeconomic shock, which is perhaps the hardest to see in this graph. note that each connected line segment corresponds to the same contemporaneous span of 17 years, 1997–2013. each cohort shows a slowdown in the early 2000s, then a double-dip fall in 2007 and 2010 corresponding to the economic crisis and to the sovereign-debt european crisis. this is an example of year effect, i.e. an aggregate effect that synchronously but temporarily moves all the cohorts away from their profiles, in this case a fall in the economic growth rate. a deeper analysis of this figure requires us to distinguish three effects: age, cohort, and year effects. in order to do this, we apply a decomposition procedure to separate the three components. 6.2. age, cohort and year effects: a decomposition in order to estimate the decomposition of effects,we can regress the cohort consumption averages against dummy variables for all three sets 21 see deaton and paxson (1994), jappelli (1999) and jappelli andmodigliani (1998). for a previous application on italian household consumption items see bardazzi (2001). 22 “an assumption that is needed if the successive surveys are to generate randomsamples from the same underlying population.” deaton (1997), p.121. 23 for the years 2002–2013 the age variable is aggregated in classes. to construct cohorts with previous years' data where exact age is available, we assume that individuals of all ages within each class have the average consumption level of that class. 24 in fact, we work with the means of the logarithm of expenditure. table 6 selected cohorts and average expenditure. cohort year of birth age of cohort in

economics 65 (2017) 161–171 of effects. obviously, other restrictions could be used such as polynomials, but with plentiful data we can use dummy variables and thus allow the data to choose any pattern. the model can be written as y ¼ β þ aα þ cγ þ yψ þ u; ð2þ where y is the stacked vector of observations, a is a matrix of age dummies, c a matrix of cohort dummies, and y a matrix of year dummies.25 we must drop one column from each of the three matrices of dummies to avoid singularity. however, it is still impossible to estimate this regression because of an additional linear relationship across age, cohort and year. that is, if we decide to label cohorts c as the age of the household head in year t = 0 and t refers to the date, we can infer the cohort's age a as a ¼ c þ t ð3þ therefore, it is necessary to impose another restriction to obtain the normalisation effects. there are several possible alternatives and each of them implies different results. this identification problem is wellknown in the literature and alternative normalisation methods have been proposed (among others, by mckenzie, 2006; schulhofer-wohl, 2013; yang et al., 2008). all these approaches have their shortcomings and their increased generality comes at the cost of increased technical complexity. one of themost common normalisations imposes the constraint that year dummy coefficients are orthogonal to a time-trend and sumto zero (deaton and paxson, 1994). to understand this approach, we can consider an example of a variable, say consumption, growing at 5% for each year for each cohort. this growth can be represented by a time trend of 5% a year in the year effects,without either cohort or age effects, or by age effects that rise linearly with age added to cohort effects that fall linearly with age. note that these two effects are equal (5%) but of opposite sign because the cohorts are labelled by age at a fixed date, so that the older cohorts (larger c) are poorer, not richer. in our case, where energy consumption is the variable to be decomposed, it seems reasonable to attribute all the trends observable in the data to age and cohort effects, not time, and to use the year effects to capture cyclical fluctuations that average to zero over the long run. the simplest way to implement this normalisation is to estimate the model with the first age group, and the seventeenth cohort omitted, so that the reference group is that of a household headed by a 25-year-old in 1997. the year dummies are constrained to be orthogonal to a time trend and to add up to zero.26 6.3. empirical results we apply this decomposition to the energy expenditure of the households grouped into two categories: electricity and heating fuels. the results of the decomposition of age and cohort effects are presented in figs. 5 and 6; the estimated parameters and the statistics of themodel are shown in the appendix. for these energy expenditure items, two graphswith four panels are presented. the first plot shows the average of logged consumption for every fifth cohort. the other three panels show the age effects, the cohort effects (plotted as a function of the age of the household head in 1997), and the year effects respectively. all the effects are jointly statistically significant, with f-values in the case of electricity for age and cohort effects of 46.07 and 39.7 respectively, while the statistic is 112.78 for the period effects. in fig. 5, equivalent electricity expenditure rises with age, with a peak around the age of 55 and then flattening out at older ages. this life-cycle pattern is confirmed by the age effect, where the parameter rises from zero to 0.4 between ages 25 and 50 and then increases to 0.65 at age 80. the cohort effects (bottom lefthand panel) are of about the same magnitude as the age effects, and they steadily decline from younger to older generations. indeed, electricity consumption increases at about 1.2% per cohort so that, for example, the expenditure at age 50 of someone born in 1963 is on average 20% higher than the expenditure at the same age of someone born in 1947. the year effects (bottom right-hand panel) appear multi-peaked and seem to reproduce the economic cycle. 25 in our case, all thematrices havemrows,which is the number of cohort-year pairs for each commodity. the number of columns is 57 (the number of ages) formatrix a, 73 (the number of cohorts) for c, and 17 (the number of years) for y. 26 consider dt as the usual zero-one dummy. to enforce this restriction, we use a set of t-2 year dummies, dt *, defined as follows, from t = 3,… t dt ¼ dt−½t−1d2−t−2d1 fig. 4. energy expenditure by cohort. r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 169 similar conclusions can be drawn for heating fuel expenditure (fig. 6). in this case too, the age, cohort and period effects are significant.27 equivalent heating expenditure shows a steadily increasing age effect, and the effect is steeper before the age of forty. the magnitude of age effects is larger than in the case of electricity, with an average increase of 1.8% per year. as regards cohort effects, younger generations clearly have increased heating expenditure and this is particularly true for the cohort of those born in the 1970s. in general, for both energy expenditure categories we may roughly divide the 73 cohorts into two groups: the younger generations born between 1947 and 1988 and 27 the f-value for age, cohort and year effects is respectively 12.79, 8.79 and 47.07. the older generations born between fig. 6. cohort and age effects for equivalent heating fuel expenditure. fig. 5. cohort and age effects for equivalent electricity expenditure. 170 r. bardazzi, m.g. pazienza / energy economics 65 (2017) 161–171 1916 and 1946. for the younger generations, the cohort effect coefficients are between 0 and −0.2 for both energy categories, with no large inter-cohort difference in the pattern of spending. intuitively, the younger cohort grew up in the post-war period, a time of relative peace and economic growth. for the older generation, the cohort effects clearly show that cohorts born earlier spend less while those born later spendmore (the coefficients drop from−0.2 to−1.08 for heating fuels and −0.7 for electricity). most of these cohorts lived through the war and their spending attitudes were influenced by the experience. 7. concluding remarks the economics literature almost universally predicts that an aging population will increase household energy consumption demand: older households spend more on energy, and especially heating energy, because their members are at home for a larger proportion of the day and they usually need more heating comfort. however, this causal link is more complex than expected because of the different pressures exerted by socio-demographic transformations (longer life expectancy and smaller family size), economic transformations (welfare state retrenchment, changes in job market, income distribution), changes in lifestyle and environmental attitudes, and last but not least global warming. in this paper we have found evidence that in italy population aging can produce an even gloomier scenario: besides traditional drivers of energy demand – income, demographics and dwelling characteristics – the cohort effect interplays with the age effect to increase energy consumption in newer generations. indeed, by building cohort data for italian households, we have decomposed and estimated significant positive age and negative cohort effects. younger generations boost energy consumption because they have higher residential energy expenditure than the oldest cohorts observed. according to stephenson et al. (2015), different social norms, including individual expectations and aspirations, interplay with material culture and energy practices in shaping individual behaviour, subject to the external influences, which form the context where energy cultures develop. we have found hints of different energy culture clusters in consumption attitudes: the war generation (attached to the idea of scarcity of goods and energy dependency) and the baby-boom generation – people currently aged 55 and over – which grew up during the golden age of italian development and is characterized by a technology-friendly attitude. a growing number of elderly people in italy seem to be in a position to access goods associated with comfort and leisure – among which electronic equipment and digital connectivity play a key role – so a more active lifestyle and therefore a new energy culture call for greater electricity demand. the energy culture of new italian generations also seems more strictly linked to thermal comfort (heating and air conditioning) than to energy-saving attitudes and so an aging population also means more residential energy demand. in other words, a change in economic culture across generations is shaping a more energy-intensive consumption pattern, as is also signalled by the fact that the implementation of energy-saving technologies can only partially offset the change in energy-use behaviour at the country level (fig. 1). however, some factors can help to mitigate this alarming trend. on the one hand, a more active lifestyle for elderly people can potentially lead to smaller house occupancy. on the other hand, there are hints that elderly italian householders aremore concerned about the environment than is traditionally expected in the economics literature: our data showthat investment in residential solar energy equipment and household renovation is also common among the older age classes.moreover, several surveys – such as the recent eurobarometer waves – signal that environment protection is also increasingly perceived as a key priority among elderly people. public policies aimed at decreasing energy use are backed by the eu and have been implemented in all developed countries. besides economic instruments grounded on the signal of carbon price, we argue that policies specifically designed to shape energy cultures towards more sustainable behaviour – taking into account the different lifestyles and energy needs of overlapping generations – are crucial and can help italy to meet the energy-saving targets set at eu level. supplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2017.04.025. references bardazzi, r., 2001. cohort, age and year effects on italian household consumption. in: grassini, m.
