individual patient with a given condition. guidelines and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. however, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional( s) in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate. a great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by the european society of cardiology (esc), as well as by other societies and organizations. because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. the recommendations for formulating and issuing esc guidelines can be found on the esc website (https://www.escardio.org/ guidelines). the esc guidelines represent the official position of the esc on a given topic and are regularly updated. in addition to the publication of clinical practice guidelines, the esc carries out the eurobservational research programme of international registries of cardiovascular (cv) diseases and interventions which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources and adherence to guidelines. these registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in europe and around the world, based on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice. furthermore, the eschas developed and embedded in this document a set of quality indicators (qis), which are tools to evaluate the level of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the esc, hospitals, healthcare providers and professionals to measure clinical practice as well as used in educational programmes, alongside the key messages fromthe guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes. the members of this task force were selected by the esc, including representation from its relevant esc sub-specialty groups, in order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a given condition according to esc clinical practice guidelines (cpg) committee policy. a critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the riskbenefit ratio. the level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and graded according to predefined scales, as outlined below. the experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. their declarations of interest were reviewed according to the esc declaration of interest rules and can be found on the esc website (http://www.escardio.org/ guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines. this process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in the development and review processes. any changes in declarations of interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the esc and updated. the task force received its entire financial support from the esc without any involvement from the healthcare industry. the esc cpg supervises and coordinates the preparation of new guidelines. the committee is also responsible for the endorsement process of these guidelines. the esc guidelines undergo extensive review by the cpg and external experts. after appropriate revisions the guidelines are signed-off by all the experts involved in the task force. the finalized document is signed-off by the cpg for publication in the european heart journal. the guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their dating. the task of developing esc guidelines also includes the creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides, summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). these versions are abridged and thus, esc guidelines 3607 downloaded from

cardiac societies of the esc are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate and implement all esc guidelines. implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations. health professionals are encouraged to take the esc guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies. however, the esc guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. it is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription. table 2 levels of evidence ©esc 2021 level of evidence a data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses. level of evidence b data derived from a single randomized

metropolitan university user on 08 april 2025 2 introduction the aim of this esc guideline is to help health professionals manage people with heart failure (hf) according to the best available evidence. fortunately, we now have a wealth of clinical trials to help us select the best management to improve the outcomes for people with hf; for many, it is now both preventable and treatable. this guideline provides practical, evidence-based recommendations. we have revised the format of the previous 2016 esc hf guidelines1 to make each phenotype of hf stand-alone in terms of its diagnosis and management. the therapy recommendations mention the treatment effect supported by the class and level of evidence and are presented in tables. for hf with reduced ejection fraction (hfref), the tabular recommendations focus on mortality and morbidity outcomes. where there are symptomatic benefits, these are highlighted in the text and/or in the web appendices. detailed summaries of the trials underpinning the recommendations are available in the web appendices. for diagnostic indications, we have suggested investigations that all patients with hf should receive, and investigations that can be targeted to specific circumstances. as diagnostic tests have rarely been subject to randomized controlled trials (rcts), most of the evidence would be regarded as level c. however, that does not mean that there has not been appropriate rigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests. in this guideline, we have decided to focus on the diagnosis and treatment of hf, not on its prevention. management of cv risk and many cv diseases [especially systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (mi), atrial fibrillation (af), and asymptomatic left ventricular (lv) systolic dysfunction] will reduce the risk of developing hf, which is addressed by many other esc guidelines and in section 9.1 of the current guideline.27 this guideline is the result of a collaboration between the task force (including two patient representatives), the reviewers, and the esc cpg committee. as such, it is a consensus/majority opinion of the experts consulted in its development. 2.1 what is new in addition to the recommendations listed below, the following table lists some new concepts compared with the 2016 version. new concepts a change of the term ‘heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction’ to ‘heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction’ (hfmref). a new simplified treatment algorithm for hfref. the addition of a treatment algorithm for hfref according to phenotypes. modified classification for acute hf. updated treatments for most non-cardiovascular comorbidities including diabetes, hyperkalaemia, iron deficiency, and cancer. updates on cardiomyopathies including the role of genetic testing and new treatments. the addition of key quality indicators. hf = heart failure. new recommendations recommendations class recommendations for the diagnosis of hf right heart catheterization should be considered in patients where hf is thought to be due to constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, and high output states. iia right heart catheterization may be considered in selected patients with hfpef to confirm the diagnosis. iib recommendations for treatment of chronic hf hfref dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended for patients with hfref to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and death. i vericiguat may be considered in patients in nyha class iiiv who have had worsening hf despite treatment with an ace-i (or arni), a beta-blocker and an mra to reduce the risk of cv mortality or hf hospitalization. iib hfmref an ace-i may be considered for patients with hfmref to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and death. iib an arb may be considered for patients with hfmref to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and death. iib a beta-blocker may be considered for patients with hfmref to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and death. iib an mra may be considered for patients with hfmref to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and death. iib sacubitril/valsartan may be considered for patients with hfmref to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and death. iib hfpef screening for, and treatment of, aetiologies, and cv and non- cv comorbidities are recommended in patients with hfpef (see relevant sections of this document). i prevention and monitoring self-management strategies are recommended to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and mortality. i either home-based and/or clinic-based programmes improve outcomes and are recommended to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and mortality. i influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations should be considered in order to prevent hf hospitalizations. iia a supervised, exercise-based, cardiac rehabilitation programme should be considered in patients with more severe disease, frailty, or with comorbidities. iia non-invasive htm may be considered for patients with hf in order to reduce the risk of recurrent cv and hf hospitalizations and cv death. iib recommendations for management of patients with advanced hf patients being considered for long-term mcs must have good compliance, appropriate capacity for device handling and psychosocial support. i

https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong metropolitan university user on 08 april 2025 heart transplantation is recommended for patients with advanced hf, refractory to medical/device therapy and who do not have absolute contraindications. i continuous inotropes and/or vasopressors may be considered in patients with low cardiac output and evidence of organ hypoperfusion as bridge to mcs or heart transplantation. iib recommendations for management of patients after hf hospitalization it is recommended that patients hospitalized for hf be carefully evaluated to exclude persistent signs of congestion before discharge and to optimize oral treatment. i it is recommended that evidence-based oral medical treatment be administered before discharge. i an early follow-up visit is recommended at 12 weeks after discharge to assess signs of congestion, drug tolerance, and start and/or uptitrate evidence-based therapy. i recommendations for management of patients with hf and atrial fibrillation long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant should be considered for stroke prevention in af patients with a cha2ds2-vasc score of 1 in men or 2 in women. iia recommendations for management of patients with hf and ccs cabg should be considered as the first-choice revascularization strategy, in patients suitable for surgery, especially if they have diabetes and for those with multivessel disease. iia in lvad candidates needing coronary revascularization, cabg should be avoided, if possible. iia coronary revascularization may be considered to improve outcomes in patients with hfref, ccs, and coronary anatomy suitable for revascularization, after careful evaluation of the individual risk to benefit ratio, including coronary anatomy (i.e. proximal stenosis >90% of large vessels, stenosis of left main or proximal lad), comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient’s perspectives. iib pci may be considered as alternative to cabg, based on heart team evaluation, considering coronary anatomy, comorbidities, and surgical risk. iib recommendations for management of patients with hf and valvular heart disease aortic valve intervention, tavi or savr is recommended in patients with hf and severe high-gradient aortic stenosis to reduce mortality and improve symptoms. i it is recommended that the choice between tavi and savr be made by the heart team, according to individual patient preference and features including age, surgical risk, clinical, anatomical and procedural aspects, weighing the risks and benefits of each approach. i percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair should be considered in carefully selected patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, not eligible for surgery and not needing coronary revascularization, who are symptomatic despite omt and who fulfil criteria to achieve a reduction in hf hospitalizations. iia percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair may be considered to improve symptoms in carefully selected patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, not eligible for surgery and not needing coronary revascularization, who are highly symptomatic despite omt and who do not fulfil criteria for reducing hf hospitalization. iib continued recommendations for management of patients with hf and diabetes sglt2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, sotagliflozin) are recommended in patients with t2dm at risk of cv events to reduce hospitalizations for hf, major cv events, end-stage renal dysfunction, and cv death. i sglt2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin) are recommended in patients with t2dm and hfref to reduce hospitalizations for hf and cv death. i the dpp-4 inhibitor saxagliptin is not recommended in patients with hf. iii recommendations for management of patients with hf and iron deficiency it is recommended that all patients with hf are periodically screened for anaemia and iron deficiency with a full blood count, serum ferritin concentration, and tsat. i intravenous iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose should be considered in symptomatic hf patients recently hospitalized forhf and with lvef <_50% and iron deficiency, defined as serum ferritin <100 ng/ml or serum ferritin 100299 ng/ml with tsat <20%, to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization. iia treatment of anaemia in hf with erythropoietin stimulating agents is not recommended in the absence of other indications for this therapy. iii recommendations for management of patients with hf and cancer it is recommended that cancer patients at increased risk for cardiotoxicity, defined by a history or risk factors of cv disease, previous cardiotoxicity or exposure to cardiotoxic agents, undergo cv evaluation before scheduled anticancer therapy, preferably by a cardiologist with experience/interest in cardio-oncology. i treatment with an ace-i and a beta-blocker (preferably carvedilol) should be considered in cancer patients developing lv systolic dysfunction, defined as a 10% or more decrease in lvef and to a value lower than 50%, during anthracycline chemotherapy. iia a baseline cv risk assessment should be considered in all cancer patients scheduled to receive a cancer treatment with the potential to cause hf. iia recommendations for treatment of patients with hf and amyloidosis

cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). it is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. identification of the aetiology of the underlying cardiac dysfunction is mandatory in the diagnosis of hf as the specific pathology can determine subsequent treatment. most commonly, hf is due to myocardial dysfunction: either systolic, diastolic, or both. however, pathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnormalities of heart rhythm and conduction can also cause or contribute to hf. 3.2 terminology 3.2.1 heart failure with preserved, mildly reduced, and reduced ejection fraction traditionally, hf has been divided into distinct phenotypes based on the measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) (table 3). the rationale behind this relates to the original treatment trials in hf that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in patients with lvef <_40%. however, hf spans the entire range of lvef (a normally distributed variable), and measurement by echocardiography is subject to substantial variability.we have decided on the following classification of hf (table 3): • reduced lvef is defined as <_40%, i.e. those with a significant reduction in lv systolic function. this is designated as hfref. • patients with a lvef between 41% and 49% have mildly reduced lv systolic function, i.e. hfmref. retrospective analyses from rcts in hfref or hf with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef) that have included patients with ejection fractions in the 4050% range suggest that they may benefit from similar recommendations for management of patients with hf and af doacs are recommended in preference to vkas in patients with hf, except in those with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic heart valves. i for patients with hf and non-valvular af eligible for anticoagulation based on a cha2ds2-vasc score, noacs rather than warfarin should be considered for anticoagulation as noacs are associated with a lower risk of stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, which outweigh the increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. iia beta-blockers should be considered for short- and longterm rate control in patients with hf and af. iia for patients in nyha class iiii, a beta-blocker, usually given orally, is safe and therefore is recommended as firstline treatment to control ventricular rate, provided the patient is euvolaemic. i in cases of a clear association between paroxysmal or persistent af and worsening of hf symptoms, which persist despite medical therapy, catheter ablation should be considered for the prevention or treatment of af. iia av node catheter ablation may be considered to control heart rate and relieve symptoms in patients unresponsive or intolerant to intensive pharmacological rate and rhythm control therapy, accepting that these patients will become pacemaker-dependent. iib recommendations for management of patients with hf and ccs coronary revascularization should be considered to relieve persistent symptoms of angina (or an anginaequivalent) in patients with hfref, ccs, and coronary anatomy suitable for revascularization, despite omt including anti-anginal drugs. iia myocardial revascularization is recommended when angina persists despite treatment with anti-anginal drugs. i recommendations for management of patients with hf and diabetes sglt2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, sotagliflozin) are recommended in patients with t2dm at risk of cv events to reduce hospitalizations for hf, major cv events, end-stage renal dysfunction, and cv death. i empagliflozin should be considered in patients with t2dm in order to prevent or delay the onset of hf and prolong life. iia af = atrial fibrillation; ahf = acute heart failure; av = atrio-ventricular; btb = bridge to bridge; btd = bridge to decision; btr = bridge to cardiac recovery;

ejection fraction’.14 • those with symptoms and signs of hf, with evidence of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised natriuretic peptides (nps), and with an lvef >_50%, have hfpef. the diagnosis of hfref, hfmref, and hfpef is covered in more detail in their respective sections (sections 5, 7, and 8, respectively). these definitions are consistent with a recent report on the universaldefinition of heart failure.15 patients with non-cv disease, e.g. anaemia, pulmonary, renal, thyroid, or hepatic disease may have symptoms and signs very similar to those of hf, but in the absence of cardiac dysfunction, they do not fulfil the criteria for hf. however, these pathologies can coexist with hf and exacerbate the hf syndrome. 3.2.2 right ventricular dysfunction heart failure can also be a result of right ventricular (rv) dysfunction. rv mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either pressure or volume overload.16 although the main aetiology of chronic rv failure is lv dysfunction-induced pulmonary hypertension, there are a number of other causes of rv dysfunction [e.g. mi, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (arvc), or valve disease].17 the diagnosis is determined by a quantitative assessment of global rv function, most commonly by echocardiography, using at least one of the following measurements: fractional area change (fac); tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (tapse); and doppler tissue imaging-derived systolic s0 velocity of the tricuspid annulus. the diagnosis and management of rv dysfunction is covered comprehensively in a recent heart failure association (hfa) position paper.18 3.2.3other common terminology used in heart failure heart failure is usually divided into two presentations: chronic heart failure (chf) and acute heart failure (ahf). chf describes those who have had an established diagnosis of hf or who have a more gradual onset of symptoms. if chf deteriorates, either suddenly or slowly, the episode may be described as ‘decompensated’ hf. this can result in a hospital admission or treatment with intravenous (i.v.) diuretic therapy in the outpatient setting. in addition, hf can present more acutely. both of these are considered in the section on ahf (section 11). some individuals with hf may recover completely [e.g. those due to alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy (cmp), viral myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome, peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm), or tachycardiomyopathy]. other patients with lv systolic dysfunction may show a substantial or even complete recovery of lv systolic function after receiving drug and device therapy. 3.2.4 terminology related to the symptomatic severity of heart failure the simplest terminology used to describe the severity of hf is the new york heart association (nyha) functional classification (table 4). however, this relies solely on symptoms and there are many other better prognostic indicators in hf.19 importantly, patients with mild symptoms may still have a high risk of hospitalization and death.20 predicting outcome is particularly important in advanced hf to guide selection of cardiac transplantation and device therapies. this will be covered in detail in the section on advanced hf (section 10). 3.3 epidemiology and natural history of heart failure 3.3.1 incidence and prevalence in developed countries, the age-adjusted incidence of hf may be falling, presumably reflecting better management of cv disease, but due to ageing, the overall incidence is increasing.2124 currently, the incidence of hf in europe is about 3/1000 person-years (all age-groups) or about 5/1000 person-years in adults.25,26 the prevalence of hf appears to be 12% of adults.21,2731 as studies only usually include recognized/diagnosed hf cases, the true prevalence is likely to be higher.32 the prevalence increases with age: from around 1% for those aged <55 years to >10% in those aged 70 years or over.3336 it table 3 definition of

filling) makes the diagnosis more likely. cfor the diagnosis of hfpef, the greater the number of abnormalities present, the higher the likelihood of hfpef. esc 2021 esc guidelines 3613 downloaded from

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . is generally believed that, of those with hf, about 50% have hfref and 50% have hfpef/hfmref,mainly based on studies in hospitalized patients.32,35,37,38 the esc long-term registry, in the outpatient setting, reports that 60% have hfref, 24% have hfmref, and 16% have hfpef.39 somewhatmore than 50% of hf patients are female.21,40,41 3.3.2 aetiology of heart failure the most common causes (as well as some key investigations) of hf are shown in table 5. the aetiology of hf varies according to geography. in western-type and developed countries, coronary artery disease (cad) and hypertension are predominant factors.27 with regard to ischaemic aetiology, hfmref resembles hfref, with a higher frequency of underlying cad compared to those with hfpef.38,42,43 3.3.3natural history and prognosis the prognosis of patients with hf has improved considerably since the publication of the first treatment trials a few decades ago. however, it remains poor, and quality of life (qol) is also markedly reduced. the improvement in prognosis has been confined to those with hfref. mortality rates are higher in observational studies than in clinical trials.44 in the olmsted county cohort, 1-year and 5-year mortality rates after diagnosis, for all types of hf patients, were 20% and 53%, respectively, between 2000 and 2010.45 a study combining the framingham heart study (fhs) and cardiovascular health study (chs) cohorts reported a 67% mortality rate within 5 years following diagnosis.46 despite receiving less evidence-based treatment, women have a better survival thanmen.47 overall prognosis is better in hfmref compared to hfref.39 of note, transition in ejection fraction over time is common, and patients who progress from hfmref to hfref have a worse prognosis than those who remain stable or transition to a higher ejection fraction category.4852 hfpef is generally considered to confer a better survival than hfref, but most observational studies show that this difference is negligible.45,46 in contrast, the large maggic meta-analysis concluded that the adjusted mortality risk for patients with hfpef was considerably lower than in patients with hfref.53 studies from several countries have shown that between 1980 and 2000 survival in hf patients has improved markedly.41,5457 however, this positive trend may have levelled off since then.45 after the initial diagnosis, hf patients are hospitalized once every year on average.54 from 2000 to 2010, the mean rate of hospitalization in the olmsted county cohort was 1.3 per person-year. interestingly, the majority (63%) of hospitalizations were related to non-cv causes.45 studies from several european countries and the united states (us) have shown that hf hospitalization rates peaked in the 1990s, and then declined.54,55*,5860 however, in a recent study of incident hf conducted between 1998 and 2017 in the united kingdom (uk), age-adjusted rates of first hospitalizations increased by 28% for both all-cause and hf admissions, and by 42% for non-cv admissions.61 these increases were higher in women, perhaps related to higher comorbidity rates. the risk of hf hospitalization is 1.5 times higher in patients with diabetes compared to controls. af, a higher body mass index (bmi), and higher glycated haemoglobin (hba1c), as well as a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) are strong predictors of hf hospitalizations.29 due to population growth, ageing, and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities, the absolute number of hospital admissions for hf is expected to increase considerably in the future, perhaps by as much as 50% in the next 25 years.24,62 4 chronic heart failure 4.1 key steps in the diagnosis of chronic heart failure the diagnosis of chf requires the presence of symptoms and/or signs of hf and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (figure 1). typical symptoms include breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling (table 6). symptoms and signs lack sufficient accuracy to be used alone tomake the diagnosis of hf.6366 the diagnosis of chf is made more likely in patients with a history of mi, arterial hypertension, cad, diabetes mellitus, alcohol misuse, chronic kidney disease (ckd), cardiotoxic chemotherapy, and in those with a family history of cmp or sudden death. the following diagnostic tests are recommended for the assessment of patients with suspected chronic hf: (1) electrocardiogram (ecg). a normal ecg makes the diagnosis of hf unlikely.63 the ecg may reveal abnormalities such as af, q waves, lv hypertrophy (lvh), and a widened qrs complex (table 7) that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of hf and also may guide therapy. table 4 new york heart association functional classification based on severity of symptoms and physical activity class i no limitation of physical activity. ordinary physical activity does not cause undue breathlessness, fatigue, or palpitations.

(4) echocardiography is recommended as the key investigation for the assessment of cardiac function. as well as the determination of the lvef, echocardiography also provides information on other parameters such as chamber size, eccentric or concentric lvh, regional wall motion abnormalities (that may suggest underlying cad, takotsubo syndrome, or myocarditis), rv function, pulmonary hypertension, valvular function, and markers of diastolic function.16,71 (5) a chest x-ray is recommended to investigate other potential causes of breathlessness (e.g. pulmonary disease). it may also provide supportive evidence of hf (e.g. pulmonary congestion or cardiomegaly). 4.2 natriuretic peptides plasma concentrations of nps are recommended as initial diagnostic tests in patients with symptoms suggestive of hf to rule out the diagnosis. elevated concentrations support a diagnosis of hf, are useful for prognostication,72 and may guide further cardiac investigation.73 however, it should be noted that there are many causes of an elevatednp— both cv and non-cv—that might reduce their diagnostic accuracy (table 7). these causes include af, increasing age, and acute or chronic kidney disease.74 conversely, np concentrations may be disproportionately low in obese patients.75 4.2.1use in the non-acute setting the diagnostic value of nps, in addition to signs and symptoms and other diagnostic tests, such as an ecg, has been assessed in several studies in the primary care setting.68,7680 the aim of these studies was to either exclude or establish a diagnosis of hf. the task force considered studies of adequate quality that included np cut-off points in their diagnostic algorithms, below which the probability of having hf was extremely low. the upper limits of normal in the non-acute setting are 35 pg/ml for bnp, and 125 pg/ml for nt-probnp. in these studies, the negative predictive values of np concentrations below these thresholds range from 0.94 to 0.98.7678 fewer data are available for mr-proanp in chf than in ahf. a concentration of <40 pmol/l can be used to rule out hf.68 4.3 investigations to determine the underlying aetiology of chronic heart failure

fraction the diagnosis of hfref requires the presence of symptoms and/or signs of hf and a reduced ejection fraction (lvef <_40%). this is most usually obtained by echocardiography. details about the quality standards that should be adhered to when determining the presence of reduced lv systolic function by echocardiography can be found in the european association of cardiovascular imaging (eacvi) position paper.99 if assessment of ef is not possible by echocardiography, then cmr or rarely, nuclear techniques can be employed. an algorithm for the diagnosis of hfref is depicted in figure 1. for the investigation of the underlying aetiology, please refer to table 5. 5.2 pharmacological treatments for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 5.2.1 goals of pharmacotherapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hfref and should be implemented before considering device therapy, and alongside non-pharmacological interventions. there are three major goals of treatment for patients with hfref: (i) reduction in mortality, (ii) prevention of recurrent hospitalizations due to worsening hf, and (iii) improvement in clinical status, functional capacity, andqol.100102 the key evidence supporting the recommendations in this section for patients with symptomatic hfref is given in supplementary table 1. figure 2 depicts the algorithm for the treatment strategy, including drugs and devices in patients with hfref, for class i indications for the reduction of mortality (either all-cause or cv). the recommendations for each treatment are summarized below. 5.2.2 general principles of pharmacotherapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (raas) and sympathetic nervous systems with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ace-i) or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (arni), beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (mra) has been shown to improve survival, reduce the risk of hf hospitalizations, and reduce symptoms in patients with hfref. these drugs serve as the foundations of pharmacotherapy for patients with hfref. the triad of an ace-i/arni, a beta-blocker, and an mra is recommended as cornerstone therapies for these patients, unless the drugs are contraindicated or not tolerated.103105 they should be uptitrated to the doses used in the clinical trials (or to maximally tolerated doses if that is not possible). this guideline still recommends the use of arni as a replacement for ace-i in suitable patients who remain symptomatic on ace-i, beta-blocker, and mra therapies; however, an arni may be considered as a first-line therapy instead of an ace-i.106,107 the recommended doses of these drugs are given in table 8. angiotensin-receptor blockers (arbs) still have a role in those who are intolerant to ace-i or arni. the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (sglt2) inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin added to therapy with ace-i/arni/betablocker/ mra reduced the risk of cv death and worsening hf in patients with hfref.108,109 unless contraindicated or not tolerated, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended for all patients with hfref already treated with an ace-i/arni, a beta-blocker, and an mra, regardless of whether they have diabetes or not. other drugs may be used for selected patients with hfref. these are discussed in section 5.4. right heart catheterization should be considered in patients where hf is thought to be due to constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, and high output states. iia c right heart catheterization should be considered in patients with probable pulmonary hypertension, assessed by echo in order to confirm the diagnosis and assess its reversibility before the correction of valve/structural heart disease. iia c right heart catheterization may be considered in selected patients with hfpef to confirm the diagnosis. iib c emb emb should be considered in patients with rapidly progressive hf despite standard therapy when

angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace-is were the first class of drugs shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with hfref.110113 they have also been shown to improve symptoms.111 they are recommended in all patients unless contraindicated or not tolerated. they should be uptitrated to the maximum tolerated recommended doses. practical guidance on how to use ace-is is given in supplementary table 2. 5.3.2 beta-blockers beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with hfref, in addition to treatment with an ace-i and diuretic. 114120 they also improve symptoms.123 there is consensus that ace-i and beta-blockers can be commenced together as soon as the diagnosis of symptomatic hfref is established. there is no evidence favouring the initiation of a beta-blocker before an ace-i and vice versa.124 beta-blockers should be initiated in clinically stable, euvolaemic, patients at a low dose and gradually uptitrated to the maximum tolerated dose. in patients admitted with ahf, betablockers should be cautiously initiated in hospital, once the patient is haemodynamically stabilized. an individual patient data (ipd) meta-analysis of all major betablocker trials in hfref has shown no benefit on hospital admissions and mortality in the subgroup of patients with hfref with af.125 however, since this is a retrospective subgroup analysis, and because beta-blockers did not increase risk, the guideline committee decided not to make a separate recommendation according to heart rhythm. practical guidance on how to use beta-blockers is given in supplementary table 3. 5.3.3 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists mras (spironolactone or eplerenone) are recommended, in addition to an ace-i and a beta-blocker, in all patients with hfref to reduce mortality and the risk of hf hospitalization.121,122 they also improve symptoms.121 mras block receptors that bind aldosterone and, with different degrees of affinity, other steroid hormones (e.g. corticosteroid and androgen) receptors. eplerenone is more specific for aldosterone blockade and, therefore, causes less gynaecomastia. caution should be exercised when mras are used in patients with impaired renal function and in those with serum potassium concentrations >5.0mmol/l. practical guidance on how to use mras is given in supplementary table 4. 5.3.4 angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor in the paradigm-hf trial, sacubitril/valsartan, an arni, was shown to be superior to enalapril in reducing hospitalizations for worsening hf, cv mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients with ambulatory hfref with lvef <_40% (changed to <_35% during the study). patients in the trial had elevated plasma np concentrations, an egfr >_30 ml/ min/1.73 m2 and were able to tolerate enalapril and then sacubitril/ valsartan during the run-in period.105 additional benefits of sacubitril/ valsartan included an improvement in symptoms and qol,105 a reduction in the incidence of diabetes requiring insulin treatment,126 and a reduction in the decline in egfr,127 as well as a reduced rate of hyperkalaemia.128 additionally, the use of sacubitril/valsartan may allow a reduction in loop diuretic requirement.129 symptomatic hypotension was reported more commonly in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan as compared to enalapril, but despite developing hypotension, these patients also gained clinical benefits from sacubitril/ valsartan therapy.128,130 table 8 evidence-based doses of disease-modifying drugs in key randomized trials in patients with

. . . . . . . . . . therefore, it is recommended that an ace-i or arb is replaced by sacubitril/valsartan in ambulatory patients with hfref, who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment outlined above. two studies have examined the use of arni in hospitalized patients, some of whom had not been previously treated with ace-i. initiation in this setting appears safe and reduces subsequent cv death or hf hospitalizations by 42% compared to enalapril.106,107,131 as such, initiation of sacubitril/valsartan in ace-i naive (i.e. de novo) patients with hfref may be considered (class of recommendation iib, level of evidence b). patients being commenced on sacubitril/valsartan should have an adequate blood pressure (bp), and an egfr >_30 ml/min/1.73 m2. a washout period of at least 36 h after ace-i therapy is required in order to minimize the risk of angioedema. practical guidance on how to use arni is given in supplementary table 5. 5.3.5 sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors the dapa-hf trial investigated the long-term effects of dapagliflozin (sglt2 inhibitor) compared to placebo in addition to optimal medical therapy (omt), on morbidity andmortality in patientswith ambulatory hfref.108 patients participated in the trial if they were in nyha class iiiv, and had an lvef <_40% despite omt. patients were also required to have an elevated plasma nt-probnp and an egfr >_30 ml/min/1.73 m2.108 therapy with dapagliflozin resulted in a 26% reduction in the primary endpoint: a composite of worsening hf (hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in i.v. therapy for hf) or cv death. both of these components were significantly reduced. moreover, dapagliflozin reduced all-cause mortality,108 alleviated hf symptoms, improved physical function and qol in patients with symptomatic hfref.132 benefits were seen early after the initiation of dapagliflozin, and the absolute risk reduction was large. survival benefits were seen to the same extent in patients with hfref with and without diabetes, and across the whole spectrum of hba1c values.108 subsequently, the emperor-reduced trial found that empagliflozin reduced the combined primary endpoint of cv death or hf hospitalization by 25% in patients with nyha class iiiv symptoms, and an lvef <_40% despite omt.109 this trial included patients with an egfr >20 ml/min/1.73 m2 and there was also a reduction in the decline in egfr in individuals receiving empagliflozin. it was also associated with an improvement in qol.133 although there was not a significant reduction in cv mortality in the emperor-reduced trial, a recent meta-analysis of the dapa-hf and emperor-reduced trials found no heterogeneity in cvmortality.134 therefore, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended, in addition to omt with an ace-i/arni, a beta-blocker and an mra, for patients with hfref regardless of diabetes status. the diuretic/ natriuretic properties of sglt2 inhibitors may offer additional benefits in reducing congestion and may allow a reduction in loop diuretic requirement.135 the combined sglt-1 and 2 inhibitor, sotagliflozin, has also been studied in patients with diabetes who were hospitalized with hf. the drug reduced cv death and hospitalization for hf.136 it is discussed further in the ahf and comorbidity sections. therapy with sglt2 inhibitors may increase the risk of recurrent genital fungal infections. a small reduction in egfr following initiation is expected and is reversible and should not lead to premature discontinuation of the drug. practical guidance on how to use the sglt2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are given in supplementary table 6. 5.4 other drugs recommended or to be considered in selected patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

of the evidence regarding diuretics is poor and their effects on morbidity and mortality have not been studied in rcts. however, it should also be remembered that the major disease-modifying treatment trials for hfref were conducted with a high background use of loop diuretic therapy. one meta-analysis has shown that in patients with hfref, loop and thiazide diuretics appear to reduce the risk of death and worsening hf compared with a placebo, and compared with an active control, diuretics improve exercise capacity.137 loop diuretics produce a more intense and shorter diuresis than thiazides, although they act synergistically (sequential nephron blockade) and the combination may be used to treat diuretic resistance. however, adverse effects are more likely, and these combinations should only be used with care. of note, arni, mras, and sglt2 inhibitors may also possess diuretic properties.129,145 the aim of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest diuretic dose. in some euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be reduced or discontinued. 146 patients should be trained to self-adjust their diuretic dose based on monitoring of symptoms/signs of congestion and daily weight measurements. practical guidance on how to use diuretics is given in supplementary table 7. 5.4.2 angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers the place of arbs in the management of hfref has changed over the last few years. they are now recommended for patients who cannot tolerate ace-i or arni because of serious side effects. candesartan in the charm-alternative study reduced cv deaths and hf hospitalizations in patients who were not receiving an ace-i due to previous intolerance.138 valsartan, in addition to usual therapy, including ace-i, reduced hf hospitalizations in the val-heft trial.147 however, no arb has reduced all-cause mortality in any trial. 5.4.3 if -channel inhibitor ivabradine slows heart rate by inhibition of the if channel in the sinus node and is therefore only effective in patients in sr. ivabradine reduced the combined endpoint of cv mortality and hf hospitalization in patients with symptomatic hfref with an lvef <_35%, with hf hospitalization in recent 12 months, in sinus rhythm (sr) and with a heart rate >_70 b.p.m. who were on evidence-based therapy including an ace-i (or arb), a beta-blocker, and an mra.139,140 our recommendation is based on the heart rate of >_70 b.p.m. used in the shift trial. however, the european medicines agency (ema) approved ivabradine for use in europe in patients with hfref with lvef <_35% and in sr with a resting heart rate >_75 b.p.m., because in this group ivabradine conferred a survival benefit148 based on a retrospective subgroup analysis. every effort should be made to commence and uptitrate beta-blocker therapy to guideline recommended/maximally tolerated doses prior to considering ivabradine. practical guidance on how to use ivabradine is given in supplementary table 8. 5.4.4 combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate there is no clear evidence to suggest the use of this fixed-dose combination therapy in all patients with hfref. a small rct conducted in self-identified black patients showed that an addition of the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to conventional therapy (an ace-i, a beta-blocker, and an mra) reduced mortality and hf hospitalizations in patients with hfref and nyha classes iiiiv.142 these results are difficult to translate to patients of other racial or ethnic origins. additionally, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate may be considered in symptomatic patients with hfref who cannot tolerate any of an ace-i, arni, or an arb (or if they are contraindicated) to reduce mortality. however, this recommendation is based on the results of the relatively small veterans administration cooperative study, which included only male patients with symptomatic hfref who were treated with digoxin and diuretics.143 5.4.5 digoxin digoxin may be considered in patients with hfref in sr to reduce the risk of hospitalization,144 although its effect on those routinely treated with beta-blockers has not been tested. in the dig trial, the overall effect onmortality with digoxin was neutral. the effects of digoxin in patients with hfref and af have not been studied in rcts. some studies have suggested a potentially higher risk of events in patients with af receiving digoxin,149,150 whereas another meta-analysis concluded, on the basis of non-rcts, that digoxin has no deleterious effect on mortality in patients with af and hf, most of whom had hfref.151 therefore, in patients with symptomatic hf and af, digoxin may be useful for the treatment of patients with hfref and af with rapid ventricular rate, when other therapeutic options cannot be pursued.150,152155 digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window and so levels should be checked aiming for a serum digoxin concentration <1.2 ng/ml.156,157 caution should also be exercised when using it in females, the elderly, frail, hypokalaemic, and malnourished subjects. in patients with reduced renal function, digitoxin could be considered. digitoxin use in hf and sr is currently being investigated.158 hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate may be considered in patients with symptomatic hfref who cannot tolerate any of an ace-i, an arb, or arni (or they are contraindicated) to reduce the risk of death.143 iib b digoxin digoxin may be considered in patients with symptomatic hfref in sinus rhythm

hospitalization for hf was lower among those who received vericiguat than among those who received placebo.141 there was no reduction in either all-cause or cv mortality. thus, vericiguat may be considered, in addition to standard therapy for hfref, to reduce the risk of cv mortality and hospitalizations for hf. cardiacmyosin activator the galactic-hf study assessed the efficacy and safety of

devices will be discussed at the end of this section. 6.1 implantable cardioverterdefibrillator a high proportion of deaths among patients with hf, especially in those with milder symptoms, occur suddenly and unexpectedly. many of these may be due to electrical disturbances, including ventricular arrhythmias, bradycardia, and asystole, although some are due to other acute vascular events. treatments that improve or delay the progression of cv disease have been shown to reduce the annual rate of sudden death,105,160 but they do not treat arrhythmic events when they occur. icds are effective at correcting potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, and in the case of transvenous systems, also prevent bradycardia. some antiarrhythmic drugs might reduce the rate of tachyarrhythmias and sudden death, but they do not reduce overallmortality,161 and may increase it. recommendations for an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator in patients with heart failure recommendations classa levelb secondary prevention an icd is recommended to reduce the risk of sudden death and all-cause mortality in patients who have recovered from a ventricular arrhythmia causing haemodynamic instability, and who are expected to survive for >1 year with good functional status, in the absence of reversible causes or unless the ventricular arrhythmia has occurred <48 h after a mi.162164 i a primary prevention an icd is recommended to reduce the risk of sudden death and all-cause mortality in patients with symptomatic hf (nyha class iiiii) of an ischaemic aetiology (unless they have had a mi in the prior 40 days—see below), and an lvef <_35% despite >_3 months of omt, provided they are expected to survive substantially longer than 1 year with good functional status.161,165 i a an icd should be considered to reduce the risk of sudden death and all-cause mortality in patients with symptomatic hf (nyha class iiiii) of a non-ischaemic aetiology, and an lvef

experienced cardiologist before generator replacement, because management goals, the patient’s needs and clinical status may have changed.168172 iia b a wearable icd may be considered for patients with hf who are at risk of sudden cardiac death for a limited period or as a bridge to an implanted device.173176 iib b icd implantation is not recommended within 40 days of a mi as implantation at

arrest and in patients who have experienced sustained symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. an icd is recommended in such patients when the intent is to increase survival; the decision to implant should take into account the patient’s view and their qol, the lvef (survival benefit is uncertain when lvef >35%) and the absence of other diseases likely to cause death within the following year.162164,184 6.1.2 primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in an analysis of over 40 000 patients from 12 pivotal hf trials, rates of sudden cardiac death decreased by 44% over the 20-year period (from the mid-1990s to 2015).160 this is almost certainly due to advances in hf treatment, as many key guideline-recommended therapies, including beta-blockers, mras, sacubitril/valsartan, and crt pacemakers (crt-p), reduce the risk of sudden death. while the afore-mentioned hf therapies have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with hfref, amiodarone has not.161 however, if it is to be used, it should be with caution due to its significant side-effect profile. conversely, dronedarone185 and the class i antiarrhythmic agents disopyramide, encainide, and flecainide186 should not be used for prevention of arrhythmias due to the increase in mortality seen in clinical studies. although an icd reduces the rate of sudden arrhythmic death in patients with hfref,187 it would be expected that, in well-managed patients, the additional benefit afforded by an icd would be lower. in the danish trial, rates of sudden death were low in patients with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (nicm); only 70 patients out of 1116 followed upover 5 years had sudden death.166whilst there was amodest absolute reduction in sudden death with a defibrillator-containing device, this did not significantly improve the overall risk of mortality. however, subgroup analysis suggested there was a benefit in those <_70 years.188 in a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of icds in nicm a survival benefit was still seen, although the effect was significantly weakened by the inclusion of the danish trial.167 on average, patients with ihd are at greater risk of sudden death than patients with nicm and therefore, although the relative benefits are similar, the absolute benefit is greater in patients with ihd.187 two rcts showed no benefit in patients who had an icd implanted within 40 days after a mi.177,178 although sudden arrhythmic deaths were reduced, this was balanced by an increase in non-arrhythmic deaths. accordingly, an icd for primary prevention is contraindicated in this time period. furthermore, icd implantation is recommended only if a minimum of 3 months of omt has failed to increase the lvef to >35%. omt ideally includes the use of class i recommended drugs for hfref. however, the icd trials we cite predate the use of arni and sglt2 inhibitors. whether implantation of icds reduces mortality in those with an lvef >35% is unknown. there is an ongoing trial of icd therapy in such patients with the presence of scar on cmr imaging.189 6.1.3 patient selection for implantable cardioverterdefibrillator therapy patients with hfref and a qrs duration >_130 ms can be considered for crt with a defibrillator (crt-d) rather than icd. see the section on crt for further details (section 6.2). in patients with moderate or severe hf, a reduction in sudden death may be partially or wholly offset by an increase in death due to worsening hf.161 as such, icd therapy is not recommended in patients in nyha class iv, with severe symptoms refractory to pharmacological therapy, who are not candidates for a ventricular assist device (vad) or cardiac transplantation. such patients have a very limited life expectancy and are likely to die from pump failure. similarly, patients with serious comorbidities who are unlikely to survive substantially more than 1 year with good qol are unlikely to obtain substantial benefit from an icd.179183 although the danish trial did not show a significant benefit from icd therapy in patients with nicm, it should be remembered that nicm is a heterogeneous condition, and certain subgroups (e.g. laminopathies, sarcoidosis) are at higher risk of sudden death and therefore merit careful consideration of icd implantation. tools to help risk stratification (e.g. scar burden on magnetic resonance imaging) can be helpful in that regard.190192 patients should be counselled as to the purpose of an icd and involved in the decision-making process. they should also be aware of the potential complications related to implantation, any additional implications for driving, and the risk of inappropriate shocks. furthermore, patients should be informed about the circumstances where the defibrillator (or defibrillator component of a crt-d) might be deactivated (e.g. terminal disease) or explanted (e.g. infection or recovery of lv function).193 subsequent timely conversations regarding defibrillator deactivation should be held with the patient and caregiver(s). when an icd generator reaches its end of life or requires explantation, it should not be replaced automatically. rather, shared decision making should be undertaken.168172 patients should be carefully evaluated by an experienced cardiologist as treatment goals may have changed since implantation (the risk of fatal arrhythmia may be lower, or the risk of non-arrhythmic death may be higher). it is a matter of some controversy whether patients whose lvef has greatly improved and who have not required device therapy during the lifetime of the icd should have another device implanted.168172 6.1.4 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming routine defibrillation threshold testing is no longer performed following implantation of an icd or crt-d as it does not improve shock efficacy or reduce arrhythmic death.194 conservative programming with long delays195 between detection and the icd delivering therapy dramatically reduces the risk of both inappropriate and appropriate but unnecessary shocks.194,196,197 generally, for primary prevention, defibrillators are programmed to minimize pacing (e.g. ventricular demand pacing vvi at 40/min), and with a tachycardia treatment zone >200/min.194,198 ultimately—and particularly for secondary prevention—programming should be adapted according to the patient’s specific needs. 6.1.5 subcutaneous and wearable implantable cardioverter-defibrillators subcutaneous icds (s-icds) appear to be as effective as conventional transvenous icds with a similar complication rate. although the risk of inappropriate shocks appeared to be higher initially, 3626 esc guidelines downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong metropolitan university user on 08 april 2025 improved patient selection has shown s-icds are non-inferior to transvenous icds in this regard.199202 they may be the preferred option for patients with difficult venous access or those who require icd explantation due to infection. patients must be carefully selected, as s-icds cannot treat bradyarrhythmia (except post-shock pacing) and cannot deliver either anti-tachycardia pacing or crt. substantial rcts with these devices and more long-term data on safety and efficacy are awaited. a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator that is able to recognize and treat ventricular arrhythmias may be considered for a limited period of time in selected patients with hf who are at high risk for sudden death but otherwise are not suitable for icd implantation.162,175,176,203 however, the large vest trial failed to show that the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator reduced arrhythmic death in patients with an lvef <_35% following a recent acute mi.204 for more detailed recommendations on the use/indications of icd we refer the reader to the esc/european heart rhythm association (ehra) guidelines on ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.201 6.2 cardiac resynchronization therapy in appropriately selected individuals, crt reduces morbidity and mortality.211 furthermore, crt improves cardiac function, and enhancesqol.209,225 whilst the care-hf206,208 and companion210 trials compared the effect of crt with medical therapy (mt), the majority of crt studies have compared crt-d with icd, and a few have compared crt-p with backup pacing. the prevention of fatal bradycardia might be an important mechanism of benefit shared by all pacing devices. in care-hf, at baseline, 25% of patients had a resting heart rate of <_60 b.p.m.206,208,209 if prevention of bradycardia is important, the effect of crt will appear greater in trials where there is no device in the control group. however, in madit-ii, 35% of those who died with an icd did so suddenly even though they were protected from both brady- and tachyarrhythmia.226 most studies of crt have specified that the lvef should be <_35%, but raft212 and madit-crt213,214 specified an lvef <_30%, while reverse207,215,227 specified <_40% and block-hf216 <_50%. relatively few patients with an lvef of 3540% have been randomized, but an ipd meta-analysis suggests no diminution of the effect of crt in this group.211 assessing the ‘response’ to crt is challenging. indeed, many who do not appear to ‘respond’ favourably in terms of their symptoms or lv function may well have experienced the mortality benefit. several characteristics predict improvement in morbidity and mortality. the extent of reverse remodelling is one of the most important mechanisms of action of crt. patients with hfref of an ischaemic aetiology have less improvement in lv function due to myocardial scar tissue, which is less likely to undergo favourable remodelling.228 conversely, women may be more likely to respond than men, possibly due to smaller body and heart size.220,224,229 qrs width predicts crt response and was the inclusion criterion in all randomized trials,211 but qrs morphology has also been related to a beneficial response to crt. several studies have shown that patients with left bundle branch block (lbbb) morphology are more likely to respond favourably to crt, whereas there is less certainty about patients with non- lbbb morphology.230 this latter group is also underrepresented in the large crt trials.206,210,213 however, patients with lbbb recommendations for cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation in patients with heart failure recommendations classa levelb crt is recommended for symptomatic patients with hf

current debate about whether qrs durations or qrs morphology is the main predictor of a beneficial response to crt. evidence from two ipd meta-analyses indicates that after accounting for qrs duration, there is little evidence to suggest that qrs morphology or aetiology of disease influence the effect of crt on morbidity or mortality. 211,220 in addition, none of the landmark trials selected patients for inclusion according to qrs morphology, sex, or ischaemic aetiology, nor were they powered for subgroup analyses. the echo-crt trial222,223 and an ipd meta-analysis213 suggest possible harm from crt when qrs duration is <130 ms, thus implantation of crt is not recommended ifqrs duration is <130ms. if a patient is scheduled to receive an icd and is in sr, with a lbbb, crt-d should be considered if the qrs is between 130 and 149 ms and is recommended if qrs is >_150 ms. however, clinical practice varies widely among countries and if the primary reason for implanting crt is for the relief of symptoms, then the clinician should choose crt-p or crt-d, whichever they consider appropriate. the only randomized trial to compare crt-p and crt-d210 did not demonstrate a difference in morbidity or mortality between these technologies (although the trial was not powered to show such a difference). furthermore, in the danish study in patients with nicm where 58% of patients received crt there was no suggestion from subgroup analysis that crt-p was inferior to crt-d.166,167 when lvef is reduced, rv pacing may exacerbate cardiac dyssynchrony. this can be prevented by crt, which might improve patient outcomes.216218,231 however, a difference in outcome was not observed between crt and rv pacing in a subgroup analysis of raft.212 on balance, crt rather than rv pacing is recommended for patients with hfref regardless of nyha class who have an indication for ventricular pacing in order to reduce morbidity, although no clear effect on mortality was observed. patients with hfref who have received a conventional pacemaker or an icd and subsequently develop worsening hf with a high proportion of rv pacing, despite omt, should be considered for ‘upgrading’ to crt. only two small trials have compared pharmacological therapy alone vs. crt in patients with af, with conflicting results. several studies have indicated that crt is superior to rv pacing in patients undergoing atrio-ventricular (av) node ablation.217,218,231 however, af is not an indication to carry out av node ablation in patients with crt except in a few cases when ventricular rate remains persistently high despite attempts at pharmacological rate control. a subgroup analysis of patients with af from the raft study found no benefit from crt-d compared with icd, although less than half of patients had >90% biventricular capture.219 in view of the paucity of evidence for the efficacy of crt in patients with af, it may be an option in selected patients—particularly those with a qrs >_150 ms—ensuring a proportion of biventricular pacing as high as possible. observational studies report that when biventricular capture is <98%, the prognosis of patients with crt declines.218,232 whether this association reflects a loss of resynchronization (which might be remedied by device programming), poor placement of the lv lead, or greater difficulty in pacing severely diseased myocardium is uncertain. this observation has not been confirmed in any randomized trial. early studies suggested that imaging tests for dyssynchrony were not of value in selecting patients for crt.233 however, a recent study has suggested that two novel markers of dyssynchrony (apical rocking and septal flash) are associated with a response to crt, but these have not been tested as selection criteria or as prespecified subgroups in a randomized trial.234 patients with extensive myocardial scar will have less improvement in lv function with crt, but this is true of any treatment for hfref and does not reliably predict less clinical benefit. pacing thresholds are higher in scarred myocardium and, if possible, lead placement should avoid such regions.235,236 although patients with extensive scarring have an intrinsically worse prognosis, there is little evidence that they obtain less prognostic benefit from crt.211 the value of trying to optimize av intervals or interventricular delay intervals (vv intervals) after implantation using echo- or electrocardiographic criteria or bp response is uncertain but may be considered for patients who have had a disappointing response to crt.237,238 other options to consider to optimize response to crt are covered in a recently published practical article.239 following crt implantation, a review of diuretic therapy is advised as a reduction in dose or its discontinuation may be required. in addition, crt implantation may afford an opportunity to further optimize mt for hfref.240 the reader is directed to guidelines on pacing and crt for recommendations on device implantation procedures.240a 6.3 devices under evaluation cardiac contractility modulation (ccm) has been evaluated in patients with nyha class iiiiv hf, with an lvef >_25% to <_45% andqrs duration <130 ms, and was associated with a small improvement in exercise tolerance andqol.241,242 technologies that involve modification of the activity of the autonomic nervous system, e.g. baroreflex activation therapy,243,244 have also been shown to offer a modest improvement in effort capacity andqol. however, currently, the evidence is considered insufficient to support specific guideline recommendations for a reduction in mortality or hospitalization for these and a variety of other implantable electrical therapeutic technologies (see also gaps in evidence in section 16). 7 heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction 7.1 the diagnosis of heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction the diagnosis of hfmref requires the presence of symptoms and/or signs of hf, and a mildly reduced ef (4149%) the presence of elevated nps (bnp >_35 pg/ml or nt-probnp >_125 pg/ml) and other evidence of structural heart disease [e.g. increased left atrial (la) size, lvh or echocardiographic measures of lv filling] make the diagnosis more likely but are not mandatory for diagnosis if there is certainty regarding the measurement of lvef. an algorithm for the diagnosis of hfmref is depicted in figure 1. for the investigation of the underlying aetiology, please refer to table 5 (which refers to investigations regardless of lvef). 3628 esc guidelines downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong metropolitan university user on 08 april 2025 . . . . . . . . . . .

reduced ejection fraction there is a substantial overlap of clinical characteristics, risk factors, patterns of cardiac remodelling, and outcomes among the lvef categories in hf. patients with hfmref have, on average, features that are more similar to hfref than hfpef, in that they are more commonly men, younger, and are more likely to have cad (5060%),38,42,43 and less likely to have af and non-cardiac comorbidities (supplementary table 10). however, ambulatory patients with hfmref have a lower mortality than those with hfref, more akin to those with hfpef. patients with hfmref may include patients whose lvef has improved from <_40% or declined from >_50%.50 7.3 treatments for patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction as in other forms of hf, diuretics should be used to control congestion. no substantial prospective rct has been performed exclusively in patients with hfmref (supplementary table 11). some data can be gleaned from subgroup analysis of trials in hfpef, none of which have met their primary endpoint. although strong recommendations cannot be made about specific therapies at this point in time, we have included a table of recommendations to help guide the management of patients in this category. 7.3.1 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors there are no specific trials of ace-i in patients with hfmref. although, the pep-chf trial was conducted in patients with hfpef and included patients with an lvef >40%, it did not report outcomes according to lvef.11 however, in patients with hfmref, many will also have cad, hypertension, or post-mi lv systolic dysfunction and will, therefore, already be treated with ace-i. therefore, ace-i usemay be considered in patients with hfmref. 7.3.2 angiotensin receptor ii type 1 receptor blockers there are no specific trials of arbs in hfmref. the charmpreserved trial missed its primary endpoint of cv death or hf hospitalizations. 245 however, a retrospective analysis showed that candesartan reduced the number of patients hospitalized for hf among those with hfmref (with similar trends for cv and all-cause mortality). 8 moreover, a recurrent-event analysis suggested a reduction in hospitalizations for hf among the entire charm-preserved cohort, including those with hfmref.248 as for ace-i, many with hfmref will already be on an arb for other cv indications. therefore, treatment with arbs may be considered in patients with hfmref. 7.3.3 beta-blockers there is no specific trial of beta-blockade in hfmref. an ipd metaanalysis of landmark trials of beta-blockers suggested similar reductions in cv and all-cause mortality (of 50%) for patients in sr with hfref and hfmref.12 this ipd meta-analysis included the seniors trial where nebivolol reduced the composite primary endpoint of allcause mortality or cv hospital admissions in the overall population. no interaction between lvef (35% of patients had an lvef of 3550%) and the effect of nebivolol on the primary outcome was observed.119,249 many patients with hfmref may have another cv indication, such as af or angina, for a beta-blocker. therefore, treatment with beta-blockersmay be considered in patients with hfmref. 7.3.4 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists there is no specific trial of mras in hfmref. in a retrospective analysis of the topcat trial in patients with an lvef >_45%,9 spironolactone reduced hospitalizations for hf in those with an lvef <55%. there was a similar trend for cv but not all-causemortality. treatment with an mra may be considered in patients with hfmref. 7.3.5 angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor there is no specific trial of arni in hfmref. in the paragon-hf trial, which included patients with ef >_45%, although the trial missed its primary endpoint overall, a significant ef-by-treatment interaction was observed. sacubitril/valsartan, compared with valsartan, reduced the likelihood of the primary composite outcome of cv death and total hf hospitalizations by 22% in those with an ef below or equal to the median of 57%.13 further data are available from a combined analysis of the paradigm-hf and paragon-hf trials showing that sacubitril/valsartan, compared to other forms of raas blockade, has a beneficial effect, especially on hospitalizations for hf in those with hfmref.247 pharmacological treatments to be considered in patients with (nyha class ii–iv) heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction recommendations classa levelb diuretics are recommended in patients with congestion and hfmref in order to

with lvef >35%, trials of crt for hfmref were abandoned due to poor recruitment.250 there are no substantial trials of icds for primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias for hfmref; trials conducted more than 20 years ago suggested no benefit from icd implantation for secondary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias for hfmref. therefore, there is insufficient evidence to advise crt or icd therapy in patientswithhfmref. in hf patients with an lvef >_40%, the implantation of an interatrial shunt device was found to be safe, and this device is subject to investigation in a larger study before any recommendation on their use in hfpef or hfmref can be given.251 8 heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 8.1 the background to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction this guideline acknowledges the historical changes in nomenclature and the lack of consensus on the optimal lvef cut-off to define the group of patients with hf without overtly reduced ef. the term ‘preserved’ was originally proposed in the candesartan in heart failure: assessment of reduction in mortality and morbidity (charm) programme to refer to patients with an ef (>40%) that was not clearly ‘reduced’ or completely ‘normal’.252while the current guidelines have designated patients with an lvef 4149% as hfmref, we recognize that there will be debate about what constitutes ‘mildly reduced’ ef, what these ef cut-offs should be, and whether they should be different for men and women.14,253 the eacvi defines systolic dysfunction as being <52% for males and <54% for females.16 whether patients with higher efs and hf should be named hf with ‘normal’ ef has also been considered.14,254 however, given the known variability of echocardiographic measurements of lvef, the difficulties in interpreting lvef measured using different imaging modalities, and remaining controversies regarding the precise lvef cut-off to define ‘normal’ , which may vary not only with sex but also with other factors such as age and ethnicity,255 this guideline has kept the nomenclature of hfpef using an ef cut-off of 50%. importantly, clinicians should be aware that lvef is a continuous variable with a normal distribution in the general population, and the ef cut-offs used in definitions are therefore arbitrary. moreover, while the lvef cut-off to define ‘normal’ will likely be higher than 50%, the presence of a very high ef (e.g. above 6570%) should also prompt a search for pathology, such as cardiac amyloidosis (ca) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), where a ‘supra-normal’ ef may result from shrinkage of the lv end-diastolic volume (denominator of ef).256,257 8.2 clinical characteristics of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef differs from hfref and hfmref in that hfpef patients are older and more often female. af, ckd, and non-cv comorbidities are more common in patients with hfpef than in those with hfref.258 there are numerous potential causes of hfpef (table 5). the pathophysiology of various hfpef syndromes differs, and thus they require distinct therapies. red flags for the potential presence of ca include low normal bp in patients with a history of hypertension, intolerance to beta-blockers or ace-i, history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, low voltage on ecg and echocardiographic features such as thickening of the septum, posterior wall, or rv wall, enlarged atria, a small pericardial effusion, or valve thickening [for more details see the section on cmp (section 14.2)]. furthermore, it is important to exclude other conditions that might mimic the hfpef syndrome (e.g. lung disease, anaemia, obesity, and deconditioning). for a more comprehensive overview on hfpef, see the esc/hfa position statement.259 8.3 the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction the diagnosis of hfpef remains challenging. several diagnostic criteria have been proposed by societies and in clinical trials.260 these criteria vary widely in their sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing hfpef. more recently, two score-based algorithms (h2fpef and hfa-peff) have been proposed to aid the diagnosis.259,261 while the generalizability of the scores has been tested in various trial and observational cohorts, their diagnostic performance has varied.262269 both scores assign a substantial proportion of suspected hfpef patients as intermediate likelihood, wherein additional diagnostics are proposed. thus, depending on which score is used, different patients will be referred for additional testing or allocated as having hfpef. furthermore, physicians may not have access to all the specialized tests recommended by the specific diagnostic algorithms. this limits the broad clinical applicability of the scores and demonstrates the ongoing diagnostic uncertainty in hfpef.267 to facilitate broad clinical application, this guideline recommends a simplified pragmatic approach that distils the common major elements in prior diagnostic criteria and emphasizes the most frequently used variables widely available to clinicians. some of these variables, in particular, la size (la volume index >32 ml/m2), mitral e velocity >90 cm/s, septal e0 velocity <9 cm/s, e/e0 ratio >9 have been shown to be pivot points beyond which the risk of cv mortality is increased, underscoring their value.270 this recommendation is therefore consistent with the consensus document of the hfa, and does not represent a new algorithm or diagnostic score but rather a simplified approach. physicians with access to expertise may refer to the full diagnostic approach recommended by the hfa.259 3630 esc guidelines downloaded from

(2) an lvef >_50%.* (3) objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities consistent with the presence of lv diastolic dysfunction/ raised lv filling pressures, including raised nps (table 9). *of note, patients with a history of overtly reduced lvef (<_40%), who later present with lvef >_50%, should be considered to have recovered hfref or ‘hf with improved lvef’ (rather than hfpef). continued treatment for hfref is recommended in these patients.271 it is not known whether starting hf therapy in patients with recovered lvef is beneficial. patients with hfpef tend to have stable trajectory of lvef over time.272 however, in those who develop a clinical indication for a repeat echo during follow-up, around one third have a decline in lvef.273 in the presence of af, the threshold for la volume index is >40 ml/m2. exercise stress thresholds include e/e0 ratio at peak stress >_15 or tricuspid regurgitation (tr) velocity at peak stress >3.4 m/s.275 lv global longitudinal strain <16% has a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 56% for the diagnosis of hfpef by invasive testing.261 the approach to the diagnosis should involve additional confirmatory tests in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing (to confirm a reduction in exercise capacity and to help differentiate the cause of dyspnoea), exercise stress testing, and invasive haemodynamic testing.259 if resting echocardiographic and laboratory markers are equivocal, a diastolic stress test is recommended.259,274 the confirmatory test for the diagnosis of hfpef is invasive haemodynamic exercise testing. an invasively measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) of >_15 mmhg (at rest) or >_25 mmhg (with exercise) or lv end-diastolic pressure >_16 mmhg (at rest) is generally considered diagnostic.266 however, instead of an exercise pcwp cut-off, some have used an index of pcwp to cardiac output for the invasive diagnosis of hfpef260,276. recognizing that invasive haemodynamic exercise testing is not available in many centres worldwide, and is associated with risks, its main use is limited to the research setting. in the absence of any disease-modifying treatments, the current guidelines do not mandate gold standard testing in every patient to make the diagnosis, but emphasize that the greater the number of objective non-invasive markers of raised lv filling pressures (table 9), the higher the probability of a diagnosis of hfpef. 8.4 treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to date, no treatment has been shown to convincingly reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with hfpef, although improvements have been seen for some specific phenotypes of patients within the overall hfpef umbrella. however, none of the large rcts conducted in hfpef have achieved their primary endpoints. these include pep-chf (perindopril),277 charm-preserved (candesartan), 245 i-preserve (irbesartan),278 topcat (spironolactone), 246 dig-preserved (digoxin),279 and paragon-hf (sacubitril/valsartan)13 (see supplementary table 12 for the details about these and additional trials). hospitalizations for hf were reduced by candesartan and spironolactone and there was a trend towards reduction with sacubitril/valsartan, although as these trials were neutral for their primary endpoints, these are hypothesisgenerating findings only. although nebivolol significantly reduced the combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cv hospital admission in the seniors trial, this trial included only 15% with an lvef >50%.119,249 trials targeting the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway have also failed to improve exercise table 9 objective evidence of cardiac structural, functional and serological abnormalities consistent with the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction/raised left ventricular filling pressures259,261 parametera threshold comments lv mass index relative wall thickness >_95 g/m2 (female), >_115 g/m2 (male) >0.42 although the presence of concentric lv remodelling or hypertrophy is supportive, the absence of lv hypertrophy does not exclude the diagnosis of hfpef la volume indexa >34 ml/m2 (sr) in the absence of af or valve disease, la enlargement reflects chronically elevated lv filling pressure (in the presence of af, the threshold is >40 ml/m2) e/e’ ratio at resta >9 sensitivity 78%, specificity 59% for the presence of hfpef by invasive exercise testing, although reported accuracy has varied. a higher cut-off of 13 had lower sensitivity (46%) but higher specificity (86%).71,259,274 nt-probnp bnp >125 (sr) or >365 (af) pg/ml >35 (sr) or >105 (af) pg/ml up to 20% of patients with invasively proven hfpef have nps below diagnostic thresholds, particularly in the presence of obesity pa systolic pressure tr velocity at resta >35 mmhg >2.8 m/s sensitivity 54%, specificity 85% for the presence of hfpef by invasive exercise testing259,261 af = atrial fibrillation;

from onset, through critical events, periods of apparent stability, and its terminal stages.303 since the 2016 guidelines, new studies have been published that underscore the need for hf-mps and reveal more insights into how care can be delivered. a network meta-analysis including 53 randomized trials published in 2017, concluded that both disease-management clinics and home visits by nurses reduced all-cause mortality compared to usual care; home visits being most effective.308 an ipd meta-analysis of 20 studies, including 5624 patients, concluded that self-management interventions in hf patients improve outcomes despite heterogeneity in the intensity, content, and the personnel who deliver the interventions.309 hf-mps vary in their components and can apply different service models, such as clinic-based approaches (in primary, secondary, or tertiary care), home-based programmes, case management, or hybrids of these. components used in the services vary, e.g. some hf-mps use telemonitoring that may be applied at a local, regional, or national level. no service model has been shown to be consistently superior to others.310 while home visits and hf clinics do reduce all-cause admissions and mortality, educational programmes, used alone, do not.308,309 hf-mps should be patient-centred and take a holistic approach to the patient rather than focussing solely on hf; management of comorbid conditions, such as arrhythmias, hypertension, diabetes, renal dysfunction, and depression, improve patient well-being and self-management, leading to better outcomes.309,311 the organization of a hf-mp should be adapted to the healthcare system, available resources (infrastructure, facilities, staff, and finances), administrative policies, and tailored to the patient’s needs. many patients with hf would derive benefit from the early integration of a palliative and supportive approach within the care provided by all members of the hf multidisciplinary team.312,313 palliative and supportive care should be thought about for all patients with hf, regardless of stage of their illness. patients in the advanced stages and those considered for mechanical circulatory support (mcs) or heart transplantation should receive a palliative care consultation before such interventions as a matter of protocol (see section 10.2.4). 9.2.2characteristics and components of a heart failure management programme clinical trials have included complex, bundled interventions, making it difficult to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of each specific component. table 11 presents an overview of characteristics and components that are important to consider in a hf-mp. 9.3 patient education, self-care and lifestyle advice adequate patient self-care is essential in the effective management of hf and allows patients to understand what is beneficial, and to agree to self-monitoring and management plans.319 hf patients who report more effective self-care have a better qol, lower readmission rates, and reduced mortality.309 misunderstandings, misconceptions, and lack of knowledge all contribute to insufficient self-care and therefore patient education is vital. improving patients’ knowledge of their condition is fundamental for the development of self-care skills.304 education to improve self-care should be tailored to the individual patient and based on, where available, scientific evidence or expert opinion. there is little evidence that specific lifestyle advice improves multidisciplinary interventions recommended for the management of chronic heart failure recommendations classa levelb it is recommended that hf patients are enrolled in a multidisciplinary hf management programme to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and mortality.309,314,315,316 i a self-management strategies are recommended to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and mortality.309 i a either home-based and/or clinic-based programmes improve outcomes and are recommended to reduce the risk of hf hospitalization and mortality.310,317 i a influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations should be considered in order to prevent hf hospitalizations.315,316 iia b hf = heart failure. aclass of recommendation. blevel of evidence. esc 2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . esc guidelines 3633 downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong metropolitan university user on 08 april 2025 table 11 important characteristics and components in a heart failure management programme characteristics 1. patient/person-centred318 2. multidisciplinary 3. the focus of the programme should be flexible and include: • prevention of disease progression • symptom control • maintaining patients in their preferred place of care for end-stage heart failure 4. competent and professionally educated staff 5. encourage patient/carer engagement in the understanding and management of their condition components 1. optimized management;

however, providing this information has become a key component of education for self-care. general educational approaches include: • providing information in a variety of formats that take into account educational grade and health literacy. consider approaches with active roles for patients and caregivers such as ‘ask-tell-ask’, ‘teach back’, or motivational interviewing. reinforce messages at regular time intervals. • recognizing barriers to communication (language, social skills, cognition, anxiety/depression, hearing or visual challenges). • recommending ‘hfmatters.org’. offer help and guidance to use it and offer discussion of questions arising. • inviting patients to be accompanied by a family member or friend. key topics to include are recommended in table 12. 9.4 exercise rehabilitation there is consistent evidence that physical conditioning by exercise training improves exercise tolerance, and health-related qol in patients with hf. clinical trials and meta-analyses in people with hfref show that exercise rehabilitation improves exercise capacity and qol. several meta-analyses also show that it reduces all-cause and hf hospitalizations, although uncertainty persists about its effects on mortality.322328 the effect on hospitalization is seen in those who are highly adherent to the exercise programme.329 highintensity interval training, in patients who are able and willing, may improve peak oxygen consumption (vo2).330,331 supervised exercise-based rehabilitation should be considered in those who are frail, who have more severe disease or comorbidities.95 physical conditioning also improves exercise capacity and qol.332335 no data on hfmref are available, but benefits observed in the other groups of hf should also apply to this group. 9.5 follow-up of chronic heart failure 9.5.1general follow-up this is a relatively understudied area. patients with hf, even if symptoms are well controlled and stable, require follow-up to ensure continued optimization of therapy, to detect asymptomatic progression of hf or its comorbidities and to discuss any new advances in care. these guidelines recommend follow-up at intervals no longer than 6 months to check symptoms, heart rate and rhythm, bp, full blood count, electrolytes, and renal function. for patients recently discharged from hospital, or in those undergoing uptitration of medication, follow-up intervals should be more frequent.whether such stable patients need to be followed-up by cardiologists is uncertain. some studies suggest that follow-up in primary care may be appropriate.303,339 however, uptake of evidence-based interventions is poor in many settings340,104 and several studies suggest that care and follow-up provided by hf specialists, and use of quality improvement registries can lead to higher rates of optimal therapy and improved outcomes.341343 an ecg should be done annually to detect qrs prolongation344 as such patients may become candidates for crt. furthermore, it may identify conduction disturbances and af. serial echocardiography is generally not necessary, although an echocardiogram should be repeated if there has been a deterioration in clinical status. an echocardiogramis also advised 36months after optimization of standard therapies for hfref to determine the need for addition of newer pharmacological agents and implanted devices. 9.5.2monitoring with biomarkers trials investigating the use of biomarkers (particularly bnp and/or nt-probnp) to guide pharmacotherapy for hfref have produced conflicting results.345352 they are undoubtedly good prognostic markers.72,353,354 conceptually, it is not clear what a biomarkersupported strategy might offer in addition to assiduous application of guideline-recommended therapy. current evidence, therefore, does not support the routine measurement of bnp or nt-probnp to guide titration of therapy. 9.6 telemonitoring telemonitoring enables patients to provide, remotely, digital health information to support and optimize their care. data such as table 12 continued education topic goal for the patient and caregiver professional behaviour and educational tools to recognise that the carer or family members may be greatly affected and need to seek help. family and informal caregivers to be able to ask for support. discuss the preference of caregiver/family involvement. involve patients and caregivers in a respectful way. cmp = cardiomyopathy;

further evidence on management guided by implanted systems is awaited.374 10 advanced heart failure 10.1 epidemiology, diagnosis, and prognosis many patients with hf progress into a phase of advanced hf, characterized by persistent symptoms despite maximal therapy.375377 the prevalence of advanced hf is increasing due to the growing number of patients with hf, ageing of the population, and better treatment and survival of hf. prognosis remains poor, with a 1-year mortality ranging from25% to 75%.378380 the updated hfa-esc 2018 criteria for the definition of advanced hf are reported in table 13.376 a severely reduced lvef is common but not required for a diagnosis of advanced hf as it may develop in patients with hfpef as well. in addition to the reported criteria, extra-cardiac organ dysfunction due to hf (e.g. cardiac cachexia, liver or kidney dysfunction) or type ii pulmonary hypertension may be present, but are not required for the definition of advanced hf.376 the interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support (intermacs) profiles, developed to classify patients with a potential indication for durable mcs devices, describes clinical parameters and characteristics consistent with a need for advanced therapies (table 14).381 this classification has also been shown to be useful in estimating the prognosis of patients undergoing urgent heart transplantation382 or lv assist device (lvad) implantation,383 and for risk assessment in ambulatory advanced hf patients.384 prognostic stratification is important to identify the ideal time for referral to an appropriate centre (i.e. one capable of providing advanced hf therapies), to properly convey expectations to patients and families, and to plan treatment and follow-up strategies recommendations for telemonitoring recommendations classa levelb non-invasive htm may be considered for patients with hf in order to reduce the risk of recurrent cv and hf hospitalizations and cv death.374 iib b monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure using a wireless haemodynamic monitoring system may be considered in symptomatic patients with hf in order to improve clinical outcomes.372 iib b cv = cardiovascular;

(figure 4).376 patients with contraindications to mcs or heart transplantation should be considered for palliative care (see section 10.2.4). despite many prognostic parameters (supplementary table 13), predicting outcomes remains difficult and patients are often referred to advanced hf centres too late. identifying warning signs in patients with non-advanced symptoms may allow early referral so that mcs and heart transplantation may be offered before the development of end-organ failure (figure 5; supplementary table 14).376,386 an organizational model between centres with different levels of care complexity, based on a ‘hub and spoke’ network is the key to good patientmanagement.376 10.2 management in patients with advanced hf, pharmacological therapy and shortterm mcs may be needed until the implantation of long-term mcs or heart transplantation becomes available. 10.2.1 pharmacological therapy and renal replacement inotropes may improve haemodynamic parameters, reducing congestion, augmenting cardiac output, and aiding peripheral perfusion. although not proven, this may help to prevent worsening end-organ function. conversely, traditional inotropes may favor myocardial ischaemia and/or tachyarrhythmias and worsen the clinical course.387,388 they can be used as palliative therapy for the relief of symptoms in patients without other treatment options. intermittent long-term use of inotropes may be considered in outpatients to improve functional class andqol.389,390 kidney dysfunction and loop diuretic resistance often characterize the clinical course of patients with advanced hf. doubling of the loop diuretic dose is proposed, in the first instance, followed by concomitant administration of thiazides or metolazone (see section 11.3.3).145 in patients who fail to respond to diuretic-based strategies, renal replacement therapies should be considered. ultrafiltration is one of the most common approaches. it may be considered in those with diuretic resistance even if data about its effects on outcomes are unsettled.391,392 10.2.2 mechanical circulatory support mcs can improve survival and symptoms of patients with advanced hf.376,393 the use of mcs should be considered for the different scenarios listed in table 15. indications for short- and long-term mcs should be based on the intermacs profiles (table 14, figure 4). short-termmechanical circulatory support short-term mcs devices are indicated to reverse critical endorgan hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the setting of cardiogenic shock. they can be used for a short, limited, period of time, from a few days up to several weeks. the aim is to support the central nervous system and organ perfusion, to reverse acidosis and multi-organ failure until the patient’s outcome becomes clearer be that of cardiac recovery, transition to durable mcs or heart transplantation, or, in some cases, towards a more palliative approach. the care of patients on short-term mcs is complex and requires dedicated expertise including having specific plans for stopping support when neither cardiac nor brain injury recovers. short-term mcs should be used in patients with intermacs profiles 1 or 2 as a bridge to decision (btd), bridge to recovery (btr), bridge to bridge (btb) for either long-term mcs or urgent heart transplantation (figure 4).394 further details about shortterm mcs are reported in the supplementary text 11.4. long-termmechanical circulatory support long-term mcs is indicated in selected patients when mt is insufficient or when short-term mcs has not led to cardiac recovery or clinical improvement, to prolong life and improve qol, or to keep the patient alive until transplantation (bridge to transplantation, btt) or to reverse

in supplementary table 15. current 2-year survival rates in patients receiving the latest continuous-flow lvads are comparable to those after heart transplantation, although adverse events negatively affect qol. among patients with continuous flow lvads, actuarial survival was reported of 80% at 1 year and 70% at 2 years.403,404 two-year survival was 84.5% and survival free of disabling stroke or need of reoperation for lvad malfunction was 76.9% with a centrifugal-flow lvad in momentum 3.405 the fully magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow lvad has significantly reduced pump thrombosis. in momentum 3, the need for reoperation to replace a malfunctioning device was 2.3% per 24 months, with only 0.6% per 24 months risk of pump replacement because of pump thrombosis. stroke (namely, disabling stroke), major bleeding, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were also lower in the centrifugal-flow pump group than in the axial-flow pump group. however, the incidence of all bleeding events, thromboembolism and driveline infection remained similar to that with older devices.402 data on fully magnetically centrifugal-flow lvad use in real-world studies with the 2-year outcomes from the elevate registry showed an overall survival of 74.5%, with gastrointestinal bleeding in 9.7%, stroke in 10.2%, and pump thrombosis in 1.5% of patients.406 according to the imacs registry, a new composite endpoint including qol and adverse events beyond survival was proposed to help in guiding decision making. in this sense ‘living well at one year’ defined as freedom from death, stroke, bleeding requiring operation, rv assist device, pump replacement, or device-related infection within the first year, was 56.8% after isolated, centrifugal flow- lvad.383 although now outdated, rematch

hf in the absence of contraindications. post-transplant 1- year survival is around 90% with a median survival of 12.5 years.385,411,412 transplantation significantly improves qol and functional status, although, for unclear reasons, the percentage of patients returning to work is lower than expected.412 apart from primary graft dysfunction, the main challenges after heart transplantation relate to either the efficacy or side effects of immunosuppression (e.g. rejection, infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, late graft dysfunction, malignancy, renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus). organ donor shortage remains the main limitation to heart transplantation. thus, the donor heart criteria have now been extended to allow an increased upper limit of the donor age, particularly in europe. moreover, careful recipient selection is needed, based on pre-transplant and post-transplant life expectancy (both are influenced by pre-operative status and comorbidities). the main indications and contraindications for heart transplantation are listed in table 17.376,385 active infection is a relative contraindication to transplant but in some cases of infected lvads it may actually be an indication. elderly age is not an absolute contraindication. although patients aged <65 years might be more appropriate candidates due to their overall life expectancy, most programmes accept patients up to 70 years of age, and biological age as well as chronological age must be taken into account. surgical complexity [previous sternotomies, mediastinal radiation, adult congenital heart disease (achd)] should also be considered. the decision pathway to transplantation or lvad is never straightforward and is unique to each patient. eligibility for each option may

and end-of-life care while the disease trajectory of each patient with hf is unique, there is a generalizable pattern of gradual decline, punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration leading either to sudden death or death due to progressive hf. communication about the disease trajectory and anticipatory planning should start when a patient is diagnosed with advanced hf. indications for and key components of a palliative care service are reported in tables 18 and 19.312,418 a team-based approach to palliative and end-of-life care for patients with hf has been proposed.419 specific models of palliative care for patients with advanced hf have been also reported. they reduce hospitalizations, without a clear effect on survival, and have some effects onqol and symptom burden.420,421 symptom assessment should be performed on a regular basis. in addition to clinical assessment, symptoms can be assessed using the numeric rating scale, the edmonton symptom assessment scale (esas) or esas-hf, or the integrated palliative care outcome scale. treatment for symptoms needs to be considered and might include additional intervention on top ofomt: • breathlessness: repeat doses of opioids may be considered for the relief of dyspnoea; however, their effectiveness is not demonstrated. 422,423 while using opioids, all patients should be guided about opioid side effects such as constipation and nausea, urinary retention, and mental status changes. benzodiazepines may be considered as a second- or third-line treatment, when opioids and non-pharmacological measures have failed to control breathlessness. increasing the inspired oxygen concentration may provide relief of dyspnoea. • pain: non-pharmacologic management can be helpful. in addition, opioid, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and fentanyl are generally viewed as safe options and can be provided orally, intravenously, and transdermally, especially in the hospital or in patient palliative care or hospice setting.424 • anxiety and depression: adequate conventional treatment should be offered. proactive decisions and advanced planning with regard to palliative and end-of-life care discussions should be documented, regularly reviewed, and routinely communicated to all those involved in the patient’s care. healthcare providers should make sure that patients’ and carer preferences are followed, wherever possible. they should also take into account that patients may choose not to, or may not be in a position to, express preferences (e.g. due to symptoms of depression or cognitive impairment). 11 acute heart failure 11.1 epidemiology, diagnosis and prognosis ahf refers to rapid or gradual onset of symptoms and/or signs of hf, severe enough for the patient to seek urgent medical attention, leading to an unplanned hospital admission or an emergency department visit. patients with ahf require urgent evaluation with subsequent initiation or intensification of treatment, including i.v. therapies or procedures. ahf is a leading cause of hospitalizations in subjects aged >65 years and is associated with high mortality and rehospitalization rates. in-hospital mortality ranges from 4% to 10%.425428 post-discharge 1-year mortality can be 2530% with up to more than 45% deaths or readmission rates.104,426,427,429,430 ahf may be the first manifestation of hf (new onset) or, more frequently, be due to an acute decompensation of chronic hf. compared to patients with acutely decompensated chf, those with new onset hf may have a higher in-hospital mortality425 but have lower post-discharge mortality and rehospitalization rates.425,428,431,432 specific extrinsic factors may precipitate, but not cause, ahf in patients with pre-existing cardiac dysfunction (supplementary table 16). clinical severity and in-hospital trajectory are determined by the complex interplay between precipitants, the underlying cardiac substrate, and the patient’s comorbidities. table 18 patients with heart failure in whom

. the diagnostic workup of ahf starts at the time of the first medical contact, and is continued throughout the initial patient pathway, aiming to identify the clinical presentation and to diagnose and manage any potentially reversible causes/precipitants/coexisting life-threatening conditions in a timely manner (figure 6). diagnostic tests are outlined at table 20. in addition to clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic workup includes ecg and echocardiography, if possible. additional investigations, i.e. chest x-ray and lung ultrasound may be used to confirm ahf diagnosis, especially when np testing is not available. plasma np levels (bnp or nt-probnp or mrproanp) should be measured if the diagnosis is uncertain and a point-of-care assay is available. normal concentrations of nps make the diagnosis of ahf unlikely. cut-offs for acute hf are: bnp <100 pg/ml, nt-probnp <300 pg/ml and mr-proanp <120 pg/ ml.74,433435 however, elevated np values are associated with a wide range of cardiac and non-cardiac conditions (table 6). lowconcentrations can be detected in some patients with advanced decompensated end-stage hf, obesity, flash pulmonary oedema or rightsided ahf. higher levels can be found in the patients with concomitant af and/or reduced renal function.74 among other laboratory tests, troponin is useful for the detection of acute coronary syndrome (acs) although elevated levels are detected in the vast majority of patients with ahf.436438 blood urea nitrogen or urea, serum creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), and antigen carbohydrate 125 may help

the spectrum of lvef and may include rv dysfunction. distinct from the acute pulmonary oedema phenotype, it has a more gradual onset, and the main alteration is progressive fluid retention responsible for systemic congestion. sometimes, congestion is associated with hypoperfusion.426 the objectives of treatment are identification of precipitants, decongestion, and in rare instances, correction of hypoperfusion (figure 7). 11.2.2 acute pulmonary oedema acute pulmonary oedema is related to lung congestion. clinical criteria for acute pulmonary oedema diagnosis include dyspnoea with orthopnoea, respiratory failure (hypoxaemia-hypercapnia), tachypnoea, >25 breaths/min, and increased work of breathing.448 three therapies should be commenced, if indicated. first, oxygen, given as continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive positivepressure- ventilation and/or high-flow nasal cannula, should be started. second, i.v. diuretics should be administered, and third, i.v. vasodilators may be given if systolic bp (sbp) is high, to reduce lv afterload (figure 8). in a few cases of advanced hf, acute pulmonary oedema may be associated with low cardiac output and, in this case, inotropes, vasopressors, and/or mcs are indicated to restore organ perfusion. 11.2.3 isolated right ventricular failure rv failure is associated with increased rv and atrial pressure and systemic congestion. rv failure may also impair lv filling, and ultimately reduce systemic cardiac output, through ventricular interdependence.449 diuretics are often the first option of therapy for venous congestion. noradrenaline and/or inotropes are indicated for low cardiac output and haemodynamic instability. inotropes reducing cardiac filling pressures may be preferred (i.e. levosimendan, phosphodiesterase type iii inhibitors). since inotropic agents may aggravate arterial hypotension, they may be combined with norepinephrine if needed (figure 9).449 11.2.4 cardiogenic shock cardiogenic shock is a syndrome due to primary cardiac dysfunction resulting in an inadequate cardiac output, comprising a lifethreatening state of tissue hypoperfusion, which can result in multiorgan failure and death.450452 cardiac insult causing severe impairment of cardiac performance may be acute, as a result of the acute loss of myocardial tissue (acute mi, myocarditis) or may be progressive as seen in patients with chronic decompensated hf who may experience a decline in disease stability as a result of the natural progression of advanced hf and/or specific precipitants.426 diagnosis of cardiogenic shock mandates the presence of clinical signs of hypoperfusion, such as cold sweated extremities, oliguria, mental confusion, dizziness, narrow pulse pressure. in addition, biochemical manifestations of hypoperfusion, elevated serum creatinine, metabolic acidosis and elevated serum lactate are present and reflect tissue hypoxia and alterations of cellular table 21 clinical presentations of acute

compensatory vasoconstriction (with/without pressor agents), albeit at the cost of impaired tissue perfusion and oxygenation.426,427,450,454 management of cardiogenic shock should start as early as possible. early identification and treatment of the underlying cause, concomitant with haemodynamic stabilization and management of organ dysfunction, are key components of its management (figure 10,

different approaches (figure 11). pre-hospital phase in the pre-hospital setting, ahf patients should benefit from noninvasive monitoring, including pulse oximetry, bp, heart rate respiratory rate, and a continuous ecg, instituted within minutes of patient contact and in the ambulance if possible.305 oxygen therapy may be given based on clinical judgment unless oxygen saturation is <90% in which case it should be administered. in patients with respiratory distress, respiratory rate >25 breaths/min, oxygen saturation <90%, non-invasive ventilation should be initiated.444,448 although therapeutic tools may be available in the prehospital setting, whether more effective pre-hospital care would alter the clinical outcome remains to be proven in randomized clinical trials.455 furthermore, prehospital management should not delay the rapid transfer of ahf patients to the most appropriate medical setting.455,456 in-hospitalmanagement diagnostic workup and appropriate pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment must be started promptly and in parallel (figure 12). ahf patients are triaged to the appropriate level of care according to the degree of haemodynamic instability and severity of the critical illness. disposition decisions are important components of the initial phase of management (see supplementary text 11.2 and supplementary tables 1719). the type and intensity of in-hospitalmonitoring depends on clinical severity, settings of care and in-hospital course (see supplementary text 11.3). as ahf is a heterogeneous condition, management may differ according to the main clinical presentation. management starts with the search for specific causes of ahf.1,305,430 these include management of patients with pulmonary oedema sbp ≥110 mmhg loop

hyper-oxygenation may increase ventilationperfusion mismatch, suppress ventilation and lead to hypercapnia. during oxygen therapy, acid-base balance and spo2 should be monitored. non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, either continuous positive airway pressure and pressure support, improves respiratory failure, increases oxygenation and ph, and decreases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pco2) and work of breathing. although a large randomized trial had neutral results, meta-analyses suggest it may improve dyspnoea and reduce the need for intubation and mortality, compared with traditional oxygen therapy.1,458,459 noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be started as soon as possible in patients with respiratory distress (respiratory rate >25 breaths/min, spo2 <90%) to improve gas exchange and reduce the rate of endotracheal intubation.448,459 the fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) should be increased up to 100%, if necessary, according to oxygen saturation level. blood pressure should be monitored regularly during non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. the increase in intrathoracic pressure with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation decreases venous return and right and left ventricular preload. it may also decrease cardiac output and bp and should therefore be used with caution in patients with reduced preload reserve and hypotension. the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and rv afterload may also be detrimental in rv dysfunction.448 intubation is recommended for progressive respiratory failure in spite of oxygen administration or non-invasive ventilation (supplementary table 20).448 11.3.3 diuretics intravenous diuretics are the cornerstone of ahf treatment. they increase renal excretion of salt and water and are indicated

rapid onset of action and efficacy. data defining their optimal dosing, timing, and method of administration are limited. no difference in the primary efficacy outcome of patients’ symptoms global assessment was shown with a high-dose regimen, compared with a low-dose regimen, in the dose trial. however, there was a greater relief of dyspnoea, change in weight and net fluid loss (with no prognostic role for increases in serum creatinine) in the higher-dose regimen.460462 high diuretic doses may cause greater neurohormonal activation and electrolyte abnormalities and are often associated with poorer outcomes, although a cause and effect relation cannot be proven by these retrospective analyses.463466 based on these observations, it may be appropriate, when starting i.v. diuretic treatment, to use low doses, to assess the diuretic response and increase the dose when that is insufficient. diuretic treatment should be started with an initial i.v. dose of furosemide, or equivalent dose of bumetanide or torasemide, corresponding to 12 times the daily oral dose taken by the patient before admission. if the patient was not on oral diuretics, a starting dose of 2040 mg of furosemide, or a bolus of 1020 mg i.v. torasemide, can be used.145,467 furosemide can be given as 23 daily boluses or as a continuous infusion. daily single bolus administrations are discouraged because of the possibility of post-dosing sodium retention.145,461 with continuous infusion, a loading dose may be used to achieve steady state earlier. diuretic response should be evaluated shortly after start of diuretic therapy and may be assessed by performing a spot urine sodium content measurement after 2 or 6 h and/or by measuring the hourly urine output. a satisfactory diuretic response can be defined as a urine sodium content >5070 meq/l at 2 h and/or by a urine output >100150ml/h during the first 6 h.145,468 if there is an insufficient diuretic response, the loop diuretic i.v.

combination requires careful monitoring of serum electrolytes and renal function (figure 13).145,469,470 this strategy, based on early and frequent assessment of diuretic response, allows starting treatment with relatively low doses of loop diuretics, with frequent dose adjustments that may be less likely to cause dehydration and increase in serum creatinine. the loop diuretic dose should be progressively decreased when a significant negative fluid balance has been obtained. however, it should be pointed out that this algorithmis entirely based on expert opinion, to date.145,461 transition to oral treatment should be commenced when the patient’s clinical condition is stable. it is recommended that, after achievement of congestion relief, oral loop diuretics are continued at the lowest dose possible to avoid congestion.463,471 care must also be taken to avoid patients being discharged from hospital with persistent congestion, as this is a major predictor of increased deaths and rehospitalizations.462,472 hence, care should be taken to achieve adequate decongestion and establish an appropriate long-term diuretic dose before discharge.427,473 11.3.4 vasodilators intravenous vasodilators, namely nitrates or nitroprusside (supplementary table 21), dilate venous and arterial vessels leading to a reduction in venous return to the heart, less congestion, lower afterload, increased stroke volume and consequent relief of symptoms. nitrates act mainly on peripheral veins whereas nitroprusside is more a balanced arterial and venous dilator.474,475 because of their mechanisms of action, i.v. vasodilators may be more effective than diuretics in those patients whose acute pulmonary oedema is caused by increased afterload and fluid redistribution to the lungs in the absence or with minimal fluid accumulation.427,476478 however, two recent randomized trials comparing usual care with early intensive and sustained vasodilation failed to show a beneficial effect of i.v. vasodilators vs. high-dose diuretics.479,480 no recommendation favouring a regimen based on vasodilator treatment vs. usual care can thus be given, to date. intravenous vasodilators may be considered to relieve ahf symptoms when sbp is >110 mmhg. they may be started at low doses and uptitrated to achieve clinical improvement and bp control. nitrates are generally administered with an

given as 12 mg boluses in severely hypertensive patients with acute pulmonary oedema.477 care should be taken to avoid hypotension due to an excessive decrease in preload and afterload. for this reason, they should be used with extreme caution in patients with lvh and/or severe aortic stenosis. however, favorable effects were described in patients with lv systolic dysfunction and aortic stenosis when vasodilators were given with careful monitoring of haemodynamic parameters.481 11.3.5 inotropes inotropes are still needed for treatment of patients with low cardiac output and hypotension (table 22). they should be reserved for patients with lv systolic dysfunction, low cardiac output and low sbp (e.g. <90 mmhg) resulting in poor vital organ perfusion. however, they must be used with caution starting at low doses and uptitrating them with close monitoring.387,388 inotropes, especially those with adrenergic mechanisms, can cause sinus tachycardia, increase ventricular rate in patients with af, may induce myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias, and increase mortality. 387,388,430,478 levosimendan or type-3-phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be preferred over dobutamine for patients on beta-blockers as they act through independent mechanisms.482,483 excessive peripheral vasodilation and hypotension can be major limitations of type-3-phosphodiestaerase inhibitors or levosimendan, especially when administered at high doses and/or when commenced with a bolus dose.482,484 11.3.6 vasopressors vasopressors used for the treatment of ahf are reported in table 22. among drugs with a prominent peripheral arterial vasoconstrictor action, norepinephrine may be preferred in patients with severe hypotension. the aim is to increase perfusion to the vital organs. however, this is at the expense of an increase in lv afterload. therefore, a combination of norepinephrine and inotropic agents may be considered, especially in patients with advanced hf and cardiogenic shock. some studies, though with limitations, support the use of norepinephrine as first choice, compared with dopamine or epinephrine. dopamine was compared with norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor therapy in patients with shock and was associated with more arrhythmic events and with a greater mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock but not in those with hypovolaemic or septic shock. although the trial included 1679 patients, significance was seen only in a subgroup analysis of the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock and <10% of the patients had mi. as there were no data regarding revascularization, this limits the generalizability of the results.485 in another prospective randomized trial epinephrine was compared with norepinephrine in patients with cardiogenic shock due to acute mi.486 the trial was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of refractory shock with epinephrine. epinephrine was also associated with higher heart rate and lactic acidosis. despite limitations related to its relatively small sample size, short time of follow-up and lack of data regarding the maximum reached dose, the study suggests superior efficacy and safety with norepinephrine. these data are consistent with a meta-analysis including 2583 patients with cardiogenic shock showing a three-fold increase in the risk of death with epinephrine, compared with norepinephrine, in patients with cardiogenic shock.487 however, the lack of information about dose, duration of treatment, and aetiology, makes these results partially explorative. 11.3.7 opiates opiates relieve dyspnoea and anxiety. they may be used as sedative agents during non-invasive positive pressure ventilation to improve patient adaptation. dose-dependent side effects include nausea, hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression. retrospective table 22 inotropes and/or vasopressors used to treat acute heart failure drug infusion rate dobutamine 220 lg/kg/min (betaþ)

although they may be considered in selected patients, particularly in case of severe/intractable pain or anxiety or in the setting of palliation. 11.3.8 digoxin digoxin should be considered in patients with af with a rapid ventricular rate (>110 b.p.m.) despite beta-blockers (see also section 12.1.1).151,492,493 it can be given in boluses of 0.250.5 mg i.v., if not used previously. however, in patients with comorbidities (i.e. ckd) or other factors affecting digoxin metabolism (including other drugs) and/or the elderly, the maintenance dose may be difficult to estimate theoretically and measurements of serum digoxin concentrations should be performed. digitoxin is a potential alternative to digoxin and is currently being evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:nct03783429).158 11.3.9 thromboembolism prophylaxis thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin (e.g. low-molecularweight heparin) or another anticoagulant is recommended, unless contraindicated or unnecessary (because of existing treatment with oral anticoagulants).494,495 11.3.10 short-term mechanical circulatory support in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, short-term mcs may be necessary to augment cardiac output and support end-organ perfusion. short-term mcs can be used as a btr, btd or btb.450-452 the initial improvements in cardiac output, bp and arterial lactate may be counterbalanced by significant complications. high-quality evidence regarding outcomes remains scarce. hence, the unselected use of mcs in patients with cardiogenic shock is not supported and they require specialist multidisciplinary expertise for implantation and management, similar to that outlined for advanced hf centres (supplementary text 11.4; supplementary table 22, see also section 10.2.2).376,496 recent studies show that a ‘standardized team-based approach’ using predefined algorithms for early mcs implant coupled with close monitoring (invasive haemodynamics, lactate, markers of end-organ damage) may potentially translate into improved survival.497499 the intra-aortic balloon pump in cardiogenic shock ii (iabpshock- ii) trial showed no difference in 30-day, as well as in longterm, mortality between intra-aortic balloon pump (iabp) and omt in patients with cardiogenic shock following acutemi who underwent early revascularization.500502 according to these results, iabp is not routinely recommended in cardiogenic shock post-mi. however, it may still be considered in cardiogenic shock, especially if not due to acs, and refractory to drug therapy, as a btd, btr, or btb. other short-term mcs were compared with iabp in small, randomized trials and propensity-matched analyses with inconclusive results.503507 similarly, rcts comparing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) with iabp or mt are lacking. a meta-analysis including only observational studies showed favourable outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest treated with venoarterial (va)-ecmo compared to controls.508 va-ecmo may also be considered in fulminant myocarditis and other conditions causing severe cardiogenic shock.509 depending on the severity of myocardial dysfunction and/or concomitant mitral or aortic regurgitation, va-ecmo may increase lv afterload with an increase in lv end- inotropic agents

11.3.11 pre-discharge assessment and post-discharge management planning a significant proportion of patients with ahf are discharged with minimal or no weight loss and, more importantly, persistent congestion. 427,472 persistent congestion before discharge is associated with a higher risk of readmission and mortality.426,472 treatment, including diuretic dose, should therefore be optimized in order to keep the patient free of congestion. in those admitted with adhf, oral omt should be continued, except for possible dose reduction or withdrawal if there is haemodynamic instability (symptomatic hypotension), severely impaired renal function or hyperkalaemia. once haemodynamic stabilization is achieved with i.v. therapy, treatment should be optimized before discharge. 467 treatment optimization has three major aims. first, to relieve congestion. second, to treat comorbidities, such as iron deficiency, that have an impact on post-discharge outcome.512 third, to initiate, or restart oral, omt with beneficial effects on outcome. doses may be uptitrated before discharge and/or in the early postdischarge phase. studies have shown that such optimization of medical treatment is associated with a lower risk of 30-day readmission, although prospective randomized trials have not been performed, to date.103,467,513 retrospective analyses show that discontinuation or dose reduction of beta-blocker therapy during an ahf hospitalization is associated with worse outcomes.514 initiation of arni in recently hospitalized stable patients with hfref, including those who are ace-i/arb naı¨ve, is safe and may be considered in this setting.106,107 safety and better outcome have also been recently shown in a prospective randomized trial with sotagliflozin in diabetic patients hospitalized for hf, irrespective of their lvef.136 it is recommended to have one follow-up visit within 1 to 2 weeks after discharge.515,516 components of this follow-up visit should include monitoring of signs and symptoms of hf, assessment of volume status, bp, heart rate, and laboratory measurements including renal function, electrolytes, and possibly nps. iron status and hepatic function should also be assessed when not done before discharge. based on clinical evaluation and laboratory exams, further optimization and/or initiation of disease-modifying treatment for hfref should occur. retrospective studies show that such an approach is associated with lower 30-day readmission rates although prospective randomized trials have not been performed, to date.513,516518 12 cardiovascular comorbidities 12.1 arrhythmias and conduction disturbances 12.1.1 atrial fibrillation af and hf frequently coexist.519,520 they can cause or exacerbate each other through mechanisms such as structural cardiac remodelling, activation of neurohormonal systems, and rate-related lv impairment.519523 the proportion of patients with hf who develop af increases with age and hf severity.when af causes hf the clinical course seems more favourable than with other causes of hf (so called tachycardiomyopathy).524 in contrast, development of af in patients with chronic hf is associated with worse prognosis, including stroke and increased mortality.525,526 the management of patients with concomitant hf and af is summarized in figure 14.7,521 it includes: (1) identification and treatment of possible causes or triggers of af (2) management of hf (3) prevention of embolic events (4) rate control (5) rhythm control identification of triggers andmanagement of heart failure potential causes or precipitating factors such as hyperthyroidism, electrolyte disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, mitral valve disease, and infection should be identified and corrected. worsening congestion due to af should be managed with diuretics. congestion relief may reduce sympathetic drive and ventricular rate and increase the chance of spontaneous return to sr. the presence of af may reduce or abolish the prognostic benefits of beta-blockers and renders ivabradine ineffective.12,125 some treatments for hf decrease the risk of developing af, including ace-i, slightly, and crt, probably.7,527 prevention ofembolic events unless contraindicated, an oral, long-term anticoagulant is recommended in all patients with hf and paroxysmal,

appendage closure can be considered in patients with hf and af who have a contraindication to oral anticoagulation though data from randomized trials have not included patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulants.529,530 rate control data regarding rate control are not conclusive for the patients with af and hf. a strategy of lenient rate control, defined by a resting heart rate <110 b.p.m., was compared to a strategy of strict rate control, defined by a heart rate <80 b.p.m. at rest and <110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise, in race ii and in a pooled analysis of race and affirm.152,531 the studies showed no differences in outcome between the two strategies. however, only 10% of the patients in race ii and 17% of those in the pooled analysis had a history of hf hospitalization or nyha class iiiii, respectively.152,531 higher heart rates are associated with worse outcomes in observational studies. 532,533 thus, a lenient rate control is an acceptable initial approach with, however, treatment targeting a lower heart rate in case of persistent symptoms or cardiac dysfunction likely related to tachycardia (e.g. tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy).7,534 beta-blockers can be used for rate control in patients with hfref or hfmref because of their established safety in these patients (see section 5.3.2).7,534,535 digoxin or digitoxin can be considered when the ventricular rate remains high, despite beta-blockers, or when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated.151,493,536 it may therefore be considered also an alternative to beta-blockers. for patients with nyha class iv and/or haemodynamic instability, i.v. amiodarone can be considered to reduce ventricular rate.537 for hfpef, there is a paucity of evidence to demonstrate efficacy of any agent. the rate-af trial compared digoxin with bisoprolol in patients with persistent af and nyha class iiiv symptoms. compared with bisoprolol, digoxin had the same effect on qol at 6 months (primary endpoint) and a better effect on ehra and nyha functional class.536 only 19% of the patients had lvef <50% so that most of the patients can be considered as having hfmref or hfpef.536 av node ablation can be considered in patients with poor ventricular rate control despite medical treatment not eligible for rhythm control by catheter ablation or in patients with biventricular pacing.7,538540 rhythmcontrol urgent electrical cardioversion is recommended in the setting of acute worsening hf in patients presenting with rapid ventricular rates and haemodynamic instability, after consideration of the thromboembolic risk. cardioversion should be considered also to improve symptoms in patients who have persistent and symptomatic af, despite optimal pharmacological management. in patients who do not receive chronic therapy with oral anticoagulant and with af onset >48 h, at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a transoesophageal echocardiography is needed before cardioversion.7 when pharmacological cardioversion is preferred, amiodarone is the drug of choice as other antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e. propafenone, flecainide, dronedarone) are associated with worse outcomes in hfref.186,534,541544 amiodarone can help maintain hf patients in sr after cardioversion.545,546 trials including patients with hf and comparing rate control and rhythm control strategies with the latter based on antiarrhythmic drugs failed to show any benefit of one strategy over the other. 547550 more recently, east-afnet 4, enrolling patients with early af, 28.6% with hf, was stopped early after a median follow-up of 5.1 years for a lower occurrence of the primary outcome of death, stroke, or hospitalization for worsening hf or acs in the patients assigned to early rhythm control vs. those assigned to usual care.551 however, the patients assigned to the rhythm control strategy had a closer follow-up, which may have influenced their better outcome. catheter ablation was performed in a minority of the patients in the rhythm control arm (19.4%).551 la catheter ablation was compared with mt, rate or rhythm control strategy, in 363 patients with persistent or paroxysmal af, lvef <35% and an implanted device (icd or crt-d) enrolled in the castle-af trial.552 the primary endpoint of all-cause death or hf hospitalizations occurred in fewer patients in the ablation group vs. the mt group, 51 patients (28.5%) vs. 82 (44.6%) [hazard ratio (hr); 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.62; 0.430.87; p=0.007]. also, other endpoints, all-cause or cv death or worsening hf, were reduced by catheter ablation.552 this trial suggests that catheter ablation can improve the prognosis of patients with hfref. however, it enrolled a highly selected population, 363 of 3013 patients, was not blinded, had crossovers between the two treatment strategies and the number of events observed was low: 24 (13.4%) vs. 46 (25.0%) all-cause deaths and 37 (20.7%) vs. 66 (35.9%) hf hospitalizations in the ablation and mt groups, respectively.552 the cabana trial was an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicentre, randomized trial enrolling 2204 patients with symptomatic af. the trial failed to show a benefit of af ablation strategy over medical care on the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest in the overall population.553 in an analysis of the 778 patients (35%) with nyha class symptoms >ii, the primary outcome occurred in 34 patients (9.0%) in the catheter ablation group vs. 49 (12.3%) in the drug therapy group (hr; 95% ci, 0.64; 0.410.99).554 however, also in this trial, the number of events was small and hf was defined based only on symptoms with lvef available in 73% of the patients and >50% and 4049% in 79% and 11.7% of the cases, respectively.554 both castle-af and cabana showed a highly significant effect of catheter ablation on patients’ symptoms.552554 two other prospective trials enrolled patients with hfref and persistent af, who were randomized to catheter ablation or mt in one trial (amica trial, n = 140), and to catheter ablation or amiodarone in the other one (aatac trial, n = 203).555,556 the first trial failed to show any difference in the lvef increase between the two groups.555 the second trial showed superiority of catheter ablation with respect of af recurrence, the primary endpoint, with also a reduction in unplanned hospitalizations and mortality.556 in contrast with the amica trial,555 but in accordance with castle-af,552 aatac also showed a benefit of catheter ablation on lvef.556 in conclusion, there is insufficient evidence in favour of a strategy of rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs vs. rate control in patients with hf and af.547551 the results of randomized trials with esc guidelines 3659 downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong metropolitan

mt showed a consistent improvement in symptoms whereas the results on mortality and hospitalization were obtained with a relatively small number of events not permitting to draw definitive conclusions.152,548550,552554,557 12.1.2 ventricular arrhythmias ventricular arrhythmias may be a complication, and in some instances, a cause of hf. frequent ventricular premature beats (vpbs) may lead to reversible systolic dysfunction. possible factors may include dyssynchrony and abnormal calcium handling.560 initial management of ventricular arrhythmias in hf should include correction of potential precipitants (including electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypo/hyperkalaemia, and pro-arrhythmic drugs) as well as the optimization of hf drug therapy. although ischaemia may be a triggering factor, revascularization has not been shown to reduce risk of ventricular arrhythmias.561 amiodarone is effective also for suppression of ventricular arrhythmias. however, it does not reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death or overall mortality.161 for patients with premature ventricular contraction (pvc)-induced cmp, amiodarone administration may be considered to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and improve symptoms and lv function, although its side effects should be taken into consideration. other drugs are discussed in supplementary text 12.1. radiofrequency ablation of vpbs may improve lv function and, possibly, outcomes in patients with tachycardiomyopathy when vpbs contribute to lv dysfunction.562 a sustained reduction in the baseline pvc burden has been associated with a lower risk of cardiac mortality, cardiac transplantation, or hospitalization for hf during followup. 563,564 12.1.3 symptomatic bradycardia, pauses and atrioventricular block indications for pacemaker therapy do not differ in patients with hf from those with other cv disease. there is ample evidence that rv pacing may have an adverse effect on lv systolic function leading, in the long term, to hf.565 patients with hfref requiring frequent ventricular pacing, e.g. with av block or slow af, and who have systolic dysfunction, should be implanted with crt rather than a standard pacemaker to avoid adverse outcomes, as shown in the block-hf (biventricular versus right ventricular pacing in heart failure patients with atrioventricular block) trial.216 in the quest for a more physiological alternative to rv pacing, physiological pacing is being increasingly adopted.566 in a non-randomized comparison of 304 consecutive patients with his bundle pacing and 433 consecutive patients with rv pacing, the former group had less hf hospitalization and a trend in reduced mortality.567 although the technique is promising, more data are needed to confirm its role. 12.2 chronic coronary syndromes cad is the most common cause of hf in industrialized, middleincome, and increasingly in low-income, countries. it should be considered as possible cause of hf in all patients presenting with new onset hf. the diagnostic workup of patients with hf and chronic coronary syndromes (ccs) is reported in the recent 2019 esc guidelines on ccs.5 patients with hf should be carefully evaluated to assess signs and/or symptoms of ccs. clinical and family histories, physical examination, ecg and imaging tests are recommended.5 documentation of ischaemia using non-invasive and invasive tests can be difficult in patients with hf because of the possible exercise intolerance and the effects of increased end-diastolic lv pressures. coronary angiography or ctca can be performed to establish the recommendations for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure recommendations classa levelb anticoagulation long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant is recommended in all patients with af, hf, and cha2ds2-vasc score >_2 in men or >_3 in women.7 i a doacs are recommended in preference to vkas in patients with hf, except in those with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic heart valves.528,558 i a long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant should be considered for stroke prevention in af patients with a

mainstay of therapy in patients with hfref and cad because of their prognostic benefit.116120,568 ivabradine should be considered as an alternative to beta-blockers (when contraindicated) or as additional anti-anginal therapy in patients in sr whose heart rate is >_70 b.p.m.139,569 other anti-anginal drugs (e.g. amlodipine, felodipine, nicorandil, ranolazine, and oral or transdermal nitrates) are effective for treating symptoms, although data about their effects on outcomes are neutral or lacking.5,570574 trimetazidine seems to have additive effects, such as improvement of lv function and exercise capacity, in patients with hfref and ccs already on beta-blockers. 575577 trimetazidine and other anti-anginal drugs may be considered in patients with hf and angina despite beta-blocker and/or ivabradine. short-acting nitrates should be used with caution in patients with hf as they cause hypotension. diltiazem and verapamil increase hf-related events in patients with hfref and are contraindicated.578 an algorithm for the use of anti-anginal medications in patients with hfref is reported in figure 15. beta-blockers, long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers (ccbs), ivabradine, ranolazine, trimetazidine, nicorandil and their combinations should be considered in hfpef for angina relief but without a foreseen benefit on hf and coronary end points. low-dose of rivaroxaban [2.5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.)] did not add prognostic benefit in patients with hfref and ccs in the commander-hf trial, a study to assess the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban in reducing the risk of death, mi or stroke in participants with hf and cad following an episode of decompensated hf.579 this trial included patients with hfref and a recent episode of worsening hf occurring within 21 days from the time of enrolment. these patients are at high risk of hf-related events and these were the main cause of deaths and hospitalizations in the trial. rivaroxaban had no effect on these events. in contrast, in a non-pre-specified subgroup analysis of the compass trial, low dose of rivaroxaban, on top of aspirin, was associated with a reduction in ischaemic events in patients with hf, mainly hfmref or hfpef.580 based on these data, low-dose rivaroxaban may be considered in patients with cad (or peripheral artery disease) and use of anti-anginal medications in

compared coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) with mt in patients with cad, amenable by cabg, and with reduced lv function (ef <_35%). at a median follow-up of 56 months, there was no significant difference between the cabg group and themt group in the rate of death from any cause, primary outcome of the trial.89 the extended follow-up report showed a significant reduction of death in the cabg group vs. the control group (58.9% vs. 66.1%; hr 0.84; 95% ci, 0.730.97; p = 0.02) over 10 years.581 cv death and the combined endpoint of all-cause death or hospitalization for cv causes were also significantly reduced after cabg at 10 years of follow-up.581 post hoc analyses of the stich trial suggested that neither myocardial viability, angina, nor ischaemia were related with outcomes after revascularization.92,93,582 the heart failure revascularisation trial (heart) was under-powered, with only 138 of the planned 800 patients to be enrolled, and failed to show differences in outcomes between hf patients receiving cabg ormt.583 there are currently no reported rcts comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with mt in patients with hfref. however, the revived-bcis2 trial has finished recruitment (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01920048).584 there are also no randomized studies comparing pci with cabg as such randomized trials excluded patients with hfref. in one prospective registry, including 4616 patients with multivessel disease and hfref, propensity-score matched comparisons showed similar survival (mean follow-up 2.9 years) in pci vs. cabg group with pcis associated with a higher risk of mi, particularly in patients with incomplete revascularization, and cabg associated with a higher risk of stroke.585 a propensity-matched analysis showed a significantly lower risk of death or major cv events in diabetic patients with lv dysfunction and multivessel disease treated with cabg compared with pci.586 cabg was associated with better outcome than pci also in patients with moderate or severe lv dysfunction and left main or complex coronary disease.587,588 two meta-analyses confirmed that cabg is associated with better outcomes, including mortality, mi, and repeated revascularization, compared with pci and/or mt.589,590 12.3 valvular heart disease 12.3.1 aortic stenosis aortic stenosis may cause or worsen hf by increasing lv afterload and causing lv hypertrophy and remodelling.591 when hf symptoms occur in patients with severe aortic stenosis, prognosis is extremely poor. no mt for aortic stenosis can improve outcomes. hfmedical treatment should be given to all hf patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. care must be taken using vasodilators to avoid hypotension. importantly, possible improvement of symptoms after mt should not delay intervention. in the presence of suspected symptomatic and severe highgradient aortic stenosis (valve area <_1 cm2, mean gradient >_40 mmhg), other causes of high flow status must be excluded and corrected (i.e. anaemia, hyperthyroidism, arteriovenous shunts) before proceeding to aortic valve intervention.592 an aortic valve intervention is recommended in patients with hf symptoms and severe, high-gradient aortic stenosis, regardless of lvef. management of patients with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis is reported in figure 16.592 intervention is recommended in patients with a life expectancy >1 year, avoiding futility. transcatheter aortic valve implantation (tavi) has been shown to be non-inferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (savr) in reducing clinical events (including mortality and disabling stroke) in patients at high and intermediate risk for surgery.593600 in low-risk patients, mean age in the rcts comparing tavi and savr was >70 years and follow-up was restricted to 2 years. therefore, savr is recommended in patients aged <75 years and at low surgical risk (sts-prom score or euroscore ii <4%), whereas tavi is recommended in those aged >75 years or at high/ prohibitive surgical risk (sts-prom score or euroscore ii >8%). in all the other cases, the choice between tavi and savr should be made by the heart team, weighing the pros and cons of each procedure, according to age, life expectancy, individual patient preference and other features including clinical and anatomical aspects. aortic recommendations for myocardial revascularization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction recommendations classa levelb cabg should be considered as the first-choice revascularization strategy, in patients

(functional)mitral regurgitation secondary mitral regurgitation (smr) is mostly a disease of the left ventricle. it can also be caused by mitral annulus enlargement due to la dilation.606 moderate or severe smr is associated with an extremely poor prognosis in patients with hf.607,608 the assessment of mr aetiology and severity should be performed by an experienced echocardiographer applying a multi-parametric approach, and ideally in stable patient conditions, after optimization of medical and resynchronization therapies. being smr a dynamic condition, echocardiographic quantification during exercise may be helpful in patients with moderate smr at rest and symptoms during physical activity.609 early referral of patients with hf and moderate or severe mr to a multidisciplinary heart team, including hf specialists, is recommended for assessment and treatment planning. the heart team has to verify, first of all, that the patient is on optimal therapy, including crt, when indicated (figure 17). in patients with severe smr and hfref requiring revascularization, mitral valve surgery and cabg should be considered. isolated mitral valve surgery may be considered in symptomatic patients with severe smr despite optimal therapy and low surgical risk.592 two randomized trials, mitra-fr and coapt, evaluated the effectiveness of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair plus omt compared to omt alone, in symptomatic patients with reduced lvef (1540% in mitra-fr and 2050% in coapt) and moderate-to-severe or severe smr [effective regurgitant orifice area (eroa) >_ 20 mm2

dilatation may be responsible for the diverging results of the mitra-fr and coapt trials.613615 thus, percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair should be considered for outcome improvement only in carefully selected patients who remain symptomatic (nyha class iiiv) despite omt, with moderate-to-severe or severe smr (eroa >_30 mm2), favourable anatomical conditions, and fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the coapt study (i.e. lvef 2050%, lv end-systolic diameter <70 mm, systolic pulmonary pressure <70 mmhg, absence of moderate or severe rv dysfunction, absence of severe tr, absence of haemodynamic instability) (figure 17).615,616 percutaneous edge-to-to edge mitral valve repair may also be considered to improve symptoms in patients with advanced hf, severe smr and severe symptoms despite omt. in these patients, cardiac transplantation or lvad implantation must also be considered.376,617 other percutaneous mitral valve repair systems, such as indirect annuloplasty, are available for treatment of smr. this approach has a shorter learning curve and lesser technical requirements than percutaneous edge-to-to edge mitral valve repair and does not preclude different procedures once it is performed. a sham-controlled randomized trial testing a transcatheter indirect mitral annuloplasty device met its primary endpoint of mitral regurgitant volume reduction with reverse lv and la remodelling at 12 months.618 further studies confirmed favourable results on la volumes and lv remodelling with trends towards improvement in mean 6mwt distance and symptoms and a reduction in hf hospitalizations in an ipd meta-analysis. 619622 transcatheter mitral valve replacement is also emerging as a possible alternative option, but randomized trials are still lacking.623 mitral valve interventions are not recommended in patients with a life expectancy of <1 year due to extra-cardiac conditions.592 recommendations for the management of valvular heart disease in patients with heart failure recommendations classa levelb aortic stenosis aortic valve intervention, tavi or savr, is recommended in patients with hf and severe highgradient aortic stenosis to reduce mortality and improve symptoms.594 i b it is recommended that the choice between tavi and savr be made by the heart team, according to individual patient preference and features including age, surgical risk, clinical, anatomical and procedural aspects, weighing the risks and benefits of each approach.592 i c secondary mitral regurgitation percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair should be considered in carefully selected patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, not eligible for surgery and not needing coronary revascularization, who are symptomaticc despite omt and who fulfil criteriad for achieving a reduction in hf hospitalizations.612 iia b in patients with hf, severe secondary mitral regurgitation and cad who need revascularization, cabg and mitral valve surgery should be considered. iia c percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair may be considered to improve symptoms in carefully selected patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, not eligible for surgery

regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation (tr) can be caused by or be a consequence of rv dysfunction and hf. the management of hf with tr includes mt (i.e. diuretics, neurohormonal antagonists). transcatheter therapy and surgery may be considered in selected cases.592amultidisciplinary heart team, including hf specialists, should be considered for assessment and treatment planning. tricuspid valve surgery is recommended in patients with severe tr requiring left-sided cardiac surgery. it should be also considered in patients with moderate tr and tricuspid annulus dilatation requiring left-sided cardiac surgery and in symptomatic patients with isolated severe tr.592 however, surgery in isolated tr is burdened by high in-hospital mortality (8.8%) although the advanced stage of hf may have influenced these data.624 transcatheter techniques have recently emerged as potential treatment options of tr. preliminary results show improvement in tr severity and symptoms with low complication rates.625 further prospective studies are needed to show the prognostic impact of these treatments in hf patients. 12.4 hypertension arterial hypertension is a leading risk factor for the development of hf. almost two-thirds of hf patients have a past history of hypertension. 104,626 clinical trials evaluating antihypertensive strategies and bp targets in patients with hf and hypertension have not been performed. treatment of hfref is similar in hypertensive and normotensive patients. recommended medications, including neurohormonal antagonists and diuretics, lower also bp. lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, reduced sodium intake, and increased physical activity, are useful adjunctive measures.4 uncontrolled hypertension in patients with hfref is rare, provided the patient is receiving omt at recommended doses for hf. if further bp lowering is required, in absence of signs of fluid overload, amlodipine and felodipine have been shown to be safe in hfref and may be considered.570,571 nondihydropyridine ccbs (diltiazem and verapamil) and centrally acting agents, such as moxonidine, are contraindicated as they are associated with worse outcomes.627 alpha-blockers have no effects on survival and are therefore not indicated.143 they can be used for the treatment of concomitant prostatic hyperplasia but should be withdrawn in cases of hypotension. hypertension is the most important cause of hfpef, with a prevalence of 60% to 89%.39 patients with hfpef also frequently have an exaggerated hypertensive response to exercise and may present with hypertensive acute pulmonary oedema.628,629 antihypertensive agents, including ace-i, arbs, beta-blockers, ccb, and diuretics reduce the incidence of hf.630,631 reducing bp leads also to lvh regression, the degree of which depends on the class of drug used.4 arbs, ace-i, and ccbs cause more effective lvh regression than beta-blockers or diuretics.632 poorly controlled hypertension may precipitate episodes of decompensation. causes of secondary hypertension, such as renal vascular or parenchymal disease, primary aldosteronism and obstructive sleep apnoea (osa), should be ruled out or, if confirmed, considered for treatment. treatment of hypertension is an important issue in patients with hfpef, but the optimal treatment strategy is uncertain. the treatment strategy used in hfref should also be considered in hfpef.4 bp targets are uncertain in both hfref and hfpef. however, evaluation of patient’s age and comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, ckd, cad, valvular heart disease and stroke) can be helpful to personalize the bp target.4 every effort should be made to reach target doses of evidence-based medications in hfref patients, despite slight hypotension. 4,633 conversely, in hfpef patients with lvh and limited preload reserve, hypotension should be avoided. 12.5 stroke hf and stroke frequently coexist because of an overlap of shared risk factors and subsequent mechanisms.519,634 a higher risk of stroke is present also in hf patients in sr.39,426,635637 af confers an additional risk and patients with hf and af have a five-fold increased risk compared to the control population.519,634,638 as a temporal trend, the incidence of stroke is higher in the first 30 days after hf diagnosis or an episode of hf decompensation and decreases in the first 6 months following the acute event.637,639 patients with stroke and hf have higher mortality, more severe neurological deficits and longer hospital stays than those without hf.637,640 similarly, patients with hf and stroke have a higher mortality than patients without stroke.640 in commander-hf, 47.5% of strokes were either disabling, 16.5%, or fatal, 31%.637 patients with hf and concomitant af, including paroxysmal af, have a cha2ds2-vasc score of at least 1 and have therefore an indication to anticoagulation. the indication to antithrombotic strategies in patients with hf and sr is controversial. in the warfarin and aspirin in reduced cardiac ejection fraction (warcef) trial, warfarin reduced ischaemic stroke as compared with aspirin, but increased major haemorrhages and did not influence the primary endpoint of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, or death.641 meta-analyses confirm an increased risk of bleeding outweighing ischaemic stroke prevention in placebo-controlled trials in patients with hfref and sr.642 in commander-hf, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. did not improve the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, mi or stroke, nor did it favourably influence hf-related deaths or hf hospitalizations.579 there are no data to support a routine strategy of anticoagulation in patients with hfref in sr who do not have history of paroxysmal af. however, low-dose rivaroxaban may be considered in patients with concomitant ccs or peripheral artery disease, a high risk of stroke and no major haemorrhagic risk (see section 12.2). patients with visible intraventricular thrombus or at high thrombotic risk, such as those with history of peripheral embolism or some patients with ppcm or lv non-compaction (lvnc), should be considered for anticoagulation.3,643645 13 non-cardiovascular comorbidities 13.1 diabetes treatment of hf is similar in patients with and without diabetes.6,646 conversely, antidiabetic drugs differ in their effects in patients with hf and preference must be given to drugs that are both safe and reduce hf-related events.6,646,647 3666 esc guidelines downloaded from

sotagliflozin were studied in patients with established cv disease in the empa-reg outcome and vertis-cv trials, with established cv disease or cv risk factors in the canvas and declare-timi 58 trials, and with ckd and cv risk in the scored trial, respectively.293297 a small proportion of patients had a history of hf. empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduced the primary composite endpoint of major cv adverse events, including cv death or nonfatal mi or non-fatal stroke, and hf hospitalizations in empa-reg outcome and canvas, respectively.293,294 empagliflozin also reduced all-cause death or cv death alone.293 the effects on the primary endpoint were driven by the reduction in hf-related events.293,294 in declare-timi 58, dapagliflozin did not reduce major cv events but reduced the co-primary efficacy endpoint of cv death or hf hospitalization and hf hospitalization alone.295 in vertis-cv, neither the primary major cv event endpoint nor the key secondary outcome of cv death or hf hospitalization were reduced significantly by ertugliflozin, although there was a statistically significant reduction in hf hospitalization and repeated hospitalizations. 297,648 in scored, sotagliflozin reduced cv deaths and hf hospitalizations.296 in a meta-analysis of these trials and one further trial in patients with ckd (credence), overall sglt2 inhibitors reduced hf and cv hospitalization by 22%.649 sglt2 inhibitors were well tolerated, although they may cause genital fungal skin infections and, rarely, diabetic ketoacidosis.293295 trial results with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with hfref, with or without diabetes, and with the sglt1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes stabilized after hospitalization for acute hf or within 3 days after discharge, further support the administration of these agents (see section 5.3.5 and section 11.3.11).108,109,136 empa-reg outcome, canvas, declare-timi 58, and vertis-cv also showed a reduction in worsening renal function, end-stage renal disease or death from renal causes, with sglt2 inhibitors. based on these results, the sglt inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin or sotagliflozin are recommended to prevent hf and cv death and worsening kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes and cv disease and/or cv risk factors, or ckd. dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are also indicated for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and hfref (see section 5.3.5 and section 11.2.4) and sotagliflozin was shown to reduce cv deaths and hf rehospitalizations in patients recently hospitalized for hf.6,296,646,647,650 metformin is thought to be safe in patients with hf, compared with insulin and sulfonylureas, based on observational studies.651,652 however, it is not recommended in patients with an egfr <30 ml/ min/1.73m2 or hepatic impairment because of the risk of lactic acidosis. it has not been studied in controlled outcome trials, to date.6,646 regarding dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitors, hf hospitalizations were increased by 27% in one trial with saxagliptin in patients with diabetes.653 however, no difference over placebo for hf events was found with alogliptin, sitagliptin, and linagliptin.654656 vidagliptin was associated with an increase in lv volumes and a numerically greater number of deaths and cv events in a small trial in patients with diabetes and hf.657 overall, the effects on mortality or cv events were neutral in the dpp-4 inhibitor trials and metaanalyses. 658,659 these drugs are therefore not recommended to reduce cv events in diabetic patients with hf. glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptor agonists reduce the risk of mi, stroke, and cv death in patients with diabetes, although probably do not reduce incident hf.6,660 liraglutide had no effect on lvef, increased heart rate, and increased serious cardiac events in a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 241 patients with hfref with and without diabetes.661 neutral results on the primary endpoint were found in another trial in 300 patients with a numerical increase in deaths and hf hospitalizations, compared with placebo.662 glp-1 receptor agonists are therefore not recommended for the prevention of hf events. insulin is needed in patients with type 1 diabetes and to control hyperglycaemia in some patients with type 2 diabetes, especially when beta-cell function is exhausted. it is a sodium-retaining hormone and concern has been raised that it may exacerbate fluid retention in patients with hf. however, in a rct that included patients with type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose, insulin did not increase the risk of incident hf.663 use of insulin was associated with poorer outcomes in retrospective analyses of randomized trials and administrative databases.664,665 if insulin is needed in a patient with hf, the patient should be monitored for evidence of worsening of hf after treatment initiation. sulfonylureas were associated with a higher risk of hf events in some analyses.666,667 therefore, they are not a preferred treatment in patients with hf and, if needed, patients should be monitored for evidence of worsening of hf after treatment initiation.6,646 thiazolidinediones (glitazones) cause sodium and water retention and an increased risk of worsening hf and hospitalization.668 they are contraindicated in patients with hf. 13.2 thyroid disorders assessment of thyroid function is recommended in all patients with hf as both hypo- and hyperthyroidism may cause or precipitate hf.669 subclinical hypothyroidism and isolated low triiodothyronine levels recommendations for the treatment of diabetes in heart failure recommendation classa levelb sglt2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, sotagliflozin) are recommended in patients with t2dm at risk of cv events to

replacement therapy in subclinical hypothyroidism, but there is a general agreement to correct it when the tsh is >10 miu/l, particularly in patients <70 years. correction may also be considered at lower tsh levels (710 miu/l).672674 13.3 obesity obesity is a risk factor for hypertension and cad and is also associated with an increased risk ofhf. there is possibly a stronger association with hfpef.258,675677 once obese patients have hf, an obesity paradox has been described such that overweight or mildly/moderately obese patients have a better prognosis than leaner patients, particularly compared with those who are underweight.678,679 however, other variables may influence this relationship and the obesity paradox is not observed in patients with diabetes.680,681 second, bmi does not take into account body composition, e.g. the relation between lean skeletal muscle mass and fat mass. obese patients who are fit and have a preserved skeletalmusclemass have better prognosis than obese sarcopenic patients.682 waist circumference or the waist-to-hip ratio, measuring visceral obesity, is less influenced by muscle mass and may have a stronger relationship with outcomes than bmi, especially in female patients.683,684 body fat has a major impact on the diagnostic and prognostic value of multiple parameters. obese patients with hf have lower np concentrations due to increased expression of clearance receptors and augmented peptide degradation by the adipose tissue.74 peak oxygen consumption adjusted for body weight underestimates exercise capacity in obese patients and an adjustment for lean body mass should be used for risk stratification.96 obesity may be a major cause of hfpef and obese hfpef patients display several pathophysiologic mechanisms that differ from nonobese patients with hfpef.258,675677,685 caloric restriction and exercise training had additive beneficial effects on exercise capacity andqol of patients with obesity and hfpef in a randomized trial.337 13.4 frailty, cachexia, sarcopenia frailty is a multidimensional dynamic state, independent of age, that makes the individual more vulnerable to the effect of stressors.686 hf and frailty are two distinct yet commonly associated conditions. the assessment of frailty in patients with hf is crucial as it is associated with both unfavourable outcomes and reduced access to, and tolerance of, treatments. several tools have been proposed for frailty screening and assessment in different chronic conditions, including hf. the hfa of esc has developed a hf-specific tool based on fourmajor domains, clinical, psycho-cognitive, functional, and social.686 frailty ismore prevalent in patients with hf than in the general population and may occur in up to 45% of the patients, according to a recent meta-analysis.687,688 patients with hf are up to six times more likely to be frail, and frail people have a significantly increased risk of developing hf.689,690 frailty is associated with a higher risk of death, hospitalizations, and functional decline as well as with a longer duration of hospital stay.691693 the treatment of frailty in hf should be multifactorial and targeted to its main components and may include physical rehabilitation with exercise training, nutritional supplementation as well as an individualized approach to treating comorbidities.686 cachexia is defined as a ‘complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass’.694 its major clinical feature is a >5% oedema-free body weight loss during the previous 12 months or less.694,695 cachexia is a generalized wasting process that may coexist with frailty and may occur in 515% of patients with hf, especially those with hfref and more advanced disease status. it is associated with reduced functional capacity and decreased survival.695698 as it is associated with other chronic diseases, such as cancer, alternative, non-cardiac causes for cachexia should always be investigated.699 sarcopenia is defined by the presence of low muscle mass together with low muscle function, strength, or performance.698 it is usually identified by an appendicular skeletal muscle mass, defined as the sum of the muscle mass of the four limbs, 2 standard deviation below the mean of a healthy reference group aged 1840 years with a cut-off value of 7.26 kg/m2 for men.688,700,701 it occurs physiologically with aging. however, it is accelerated by chronic diseases, such as cancer and hf. sarcopenia can be found in 2050% of patients with hfref and is often associated with frailty and increasedmorbidity andmortality. it is a major determinant of outcomes outweighing the effect of body weight and bmi.684,698,701,702 so far, the most effective strategy for sarcopenia treatment is resistance exercise training, possibly combined with a protein intake of 11.5 g/kg/day.698,703 drug treatments, including anabolic compounds like testosterone, growth hormone, ghrelin receptor agonists, were tested in small studies, showing favourable results mostly in terms of exercise capacity and muscle strength.697,703705 there are no data showing a favourable impact of sarcopenia treatment on outcomes. however, exercise training has favourable effects in patients with hf (see section 9.4).95,323329 13.5 iron deficiency and anaemia iron deficiency and anaemia are common in patients with hf, being independently associated with reduced exercise capacity, recurrent hf hospitalizations, and high cv and all-cause mortality.706,707 according to the world health organization criteria, anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin concentration <12 g/dl in women and <13 g/dl in men. in patients with hf, iron deficiency is defined as either a serum ferritin concentration <100 ng/ml or 100299 ng/ ml with transferrin saturation (tsat) <20%.708710 ferritin tissue expression and concentration in the peripheral blood is increased by inflammation and several disorders such as infection, cancer, liver disease, and hf itself. hence, higher cut-off values have been applied for the definition of iron deficiency in patients with hf.709711 another marker reflecting depleted intracellular iron can be high serum soluble transferrin receptors, which derives from proteolysis of themembrane transferrin receptor. its synthesis is increased in case of iron deficiency and is not affected by inflammation. high serum soluble transferrin receptors identify patients at high risk of death beyond standard prognostic variables.711,712 however, its applicability for iron supplementation therapy has not been demonstrated yet. iron deficiency, which can be present independently of anaemia, is present in up to 55% of chronic hf patients and in up to 80% of those with ahf.713716 it may be caused by increased loss, reduced intake or absorption (i.e. malnutrition, gut congestion) and/or impaired iron metabolism caused by the chronic inflammatory activation of hf, although the exact cause of iron deficiency in hf remains unknown. iron deficiency may impair functional capacity, precipitate circulatory 3668 esc guidelines

recommended that all patients with hf are regularly screened for anaemia and iron deficiency with full blood count, serum ferritin concentration, and tsat. the detection of anaemia and/or iron deficiency should prompt appropriate investigation to define their cause. darbepoetin-alpha failed to reduce all-cause death or hf hospitalization and increased the risk of thromboembolic events in the only large-scale randomized trial in patients with hfref and mild to moderate anaemia.719 as a result, erythropoietin stimulating agents are not indicated for the treatment of anaemia in hf. rcts have shown that iron supplementation with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose is safe and improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and qol of patients with hfref and iron deficiency.720723 metaanalyses of rcts showed also a reduction in the risk of the combined endpoints of all-cause death or cv hospitalization, cv death or hf hospitalization, cv death or recurrent cv or hf hospitalizations. 724,725 the favourable effects of iron supplementation were independent from anaemia coexistence.726 in affirm-ahf, patients hospitalized for hf with lvef <50% and concomitant iron deficiency were randomized to i.v. ferric carboxymaltose or placebo, repeated at 6- and then 12-week intervals if indicated according to repeat iron studies.512 administration of ferric carboxymaltose did not significantly reduce the primary composite outcome of total hf hospitalizations and cv death at 52 weeks (rate ratio 0.79, 95% ci 0.621.01, p = 0.059). however, it reduced the composite endpoint of first hf hospitalization or cv death (hr 0.80, 95% ci 0.660.98, p = 0.030) and total hf hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.74, 95% ci 0.580.94, p = 0.013).512 therefore, iron supplementation with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose should be considered for the improvement of symptoms, exercise capacity, and qol in patients with hf and lvef <45%. it should also be considered for the reduction of hf rehospitalizations in patients with lvef <50% recently hospitalized for worsening hf. ongoing trials are expected to provide more evidence on the effects of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with hfpef. in addition, large outcomes trials with other iron formulations are ongoing in hfref, hfpef, and ahf.727 oral iron therapy is not effective in iron repletion and did not improve exercise capacity in patients with hfref and iron deficiency.728 it is therefore not recommended for the treatment of iron deficiency in the patients with hf. 13.6 kidney dysfunction ckd and hf frequently coexist.471,707,729 they share common risk factors, such as diabetes or hypertension. ckd may worsen cv function causing hypertension and vascular calcification. hf may worsen renal function, through the effects of neurohormonal and inflammatory activation, increased venous pressure and hypoperfusion. oxidative stress and fibrosis likely play a major role as pathogenic mechanisms in hf with ckd.730,731 while ckd and worsening renal function both appear more common in hfpef as compared to in hfmref and hfref, perhaps due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, they appear to be less associated with worse outcomes in hfpef than in hfmref and hfref.732,733 ckd is a major independent determinant of increased mortality and morbidity in hf.471,734736 however, there are settings in which changes in serum creatinine are not associated with worse outcomes. when raas inhibitors, arni or sglt2 inhibitors are started, the initial decrease in the glomerular filtration pressure may decrease gfr and increase serum creatinine. however, these changes are generally transient and occur despite improvement in patient outcomes and slower worsening of renal function in the long term. for instance, in emperor-reduced, the placebo-corrected egfr dip induced by empagliflozin at week 4 was of 2.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 for patients with ckd and 2.7 ml/min/1.73 m2 for those without ckd, corresponding to a decrease from baseline of 5.2% and 3.8%, respectively. this was followed by a slower slope of egfr decline and by a reduced rate of the composite kidney outcome with empagliflozin vs. placebo, with no difference between patients with or without ckd at baseline.109,737 thus, with respect to the initiation of raas inhibitors, arni or sglt2 inhibitors, a transient decrease in renal function should not prompt their interruption. an increase in serum creatinine of <50% above baseline, as long as it is <266 lmol/l (3 mg/dl), or a decrease in egfr of <10% from baseline, as long as egfr is >25 ml/min/1.73 m2, can be considered as acceptable (see section 5.3 and supplementary table 8). also, with respect to diuretic therapy, small and transient rises in serum creatinine during treatment of acute hf are not associated with poorer outcomes when the patient is free of congestion.108,109,460462,471,729,737740 randomized trials have shown that patients with hf and

hfref patients with moderate (egfr 4559 ml/min/1.73 m2) and moderately severe (egfr 3044 ml/min/1.73 m2) renal dysfunction, whereas limited evidence is available regarding patients with severe renal impairment (egfr <30 ml/min/1.73 m2).743 sacubitril/valsartan, compared with enalapril, led to a slower decline in renal function, despite a slight increase in the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and improved cv outcomes to a similar extent in patients with ckd vs. the others in paradigm-hf.127 sglt2 inhibitors lead to a slower decline in renal function, compared with placebo, both in patients with hfref and in those with ckd.108,109,737,738,744 the improvement in cardiac output after crt or lvad implantation may be associated with, at least, a transient improvement in renal function. 471,745,746 the benefits of icds may be reduced in patients with severe renal dysfunction because of the competing risk of nonarrhythmic causes of death.747749 there is little direct evidence to support any recommendations for treatment of hf patients with severe ckd as to date, rcts excluded patients with advanced stages of ckd, i.e. egfr <30 ml/ min/1.73 m2 (supplementary table 23). cut-off values for inclusion were lower in recent trials: 25 ml/min/1.73 m2 in dapa-ckd, 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 in emperor-reduced and galactic-hf, and 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 in victoria, respectively.109,141,737,738,750 despite differences in baseline characteristics between patients with severely impaired renal function and the others, no interaction between drug effects and renal function was noted in subgroup analysis of these trials.109,141,738,750 13.7 electrolyte disorders: hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia electrolyte disturbances are frequent in patients with hf and may often be iatrogenic.751 serum potassium levels have a u-shaped relation with mortality with the lowest risk of death within a relatively narrow range of 4 to 5 mmol/l.752758 hypokalaemia is defined as serum potassium <3.5 mmol/l and may occur in up to 50% of patients with hf.759 hypokalaemia is often induced by loop and thiazide diuretic administration. it may cause lethal ventricular arrhythmias and increase cv mortality. its treatment includes the use of raas inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, and prescription of oral potassium supplements (i.e. potassium chloride tablets).when oral administration is not possible, potassium supplementation by infusion may be necessary (20 to 40 mmol of potassium in 2501000 ml of normal saline). potassium-rich solution should be infused at slowrate through a large vein using a venous catheter. hyperkalaemia is defined as serum potassium >5 mmol/l and can be classified as mild (>5.0 to <5.5 mmol/l), moderate (5.5 to 6.0 mmol/l), or severe (>6.0 mmol/l).760 it is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death.752,753,755,756,761,762 hyperkalaemia can be associated with the administration of raas inhibitors, ckd and increased absorption.760 among patients with hf, the prevalence of hyperkalaemia at any given time among patients with hf appears to be less than 5%,757 but the incidence is much higher, at up to 40% in chronic hf and 73% in ckd over follow-up durations of approximately 1 year.753,756,757,763765 in paradigmhf, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan was associated with lower risk of severe hyperkalaemia, compared with enalapril.128 life-threatening hyperkalaemia requires immediate treatment with a combination of calcium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate, insulin, with or without glucose, and beta adrenoceptor agonists [e.g. salbutamol, offlabel use in some european union (eu) countries]. these agents favour potassium entry into the cells and do not increase potassium excretion. thus, they only provide temporary benefit and rebound hyperkalaemia can occur after few hours. loop diuretics can be administered to facilitate potassiumloss. potassium binders bind to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract reducing its absorption. they can be used for acute and chronic potassium lowering. they include sodium polystyrene sulfonate, calcium polystyrene sulfonate, and the much better tolerated patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (szc). sodium polystyrene sulfonate is still indicated in anuric or severely oliguric patients, but it should not be used in the medium or long term as it may cause severe gastrointestinal side effects, including bowel necrosis.760 patiromer or szc increase faecal potassium excretion and act mainly in the colon. both compounds are effective in normalizing elevated potassium levels, maintaining normokalaemia over time and preventing the recurrence of hyperkalaemia and can be considered for treatment of hyperkalaemia766768 (see supplementary table 24). renal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia are the major causes of underuse of raas inhibitors, particularly mra, in clinical practice.342,753,758,769771 administration of the potassium-lowering agents, patiromer or szc, may allow their initiation or uptitration in a larger proportion of patients. this hypothesis was tested in doubleblind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials with patiromer or placebo administration to patients with ckd and hyperkalaemia, or discontinuation of raas inhibitors for hyperkalaemia, and with an indication for spironolactone for hf and/or resistant hypertension. patiromer was more likely to lower serum potassium and decreased episodes of hyperkalaemia than spironolactone initiation and uptitration.772775 the ongoing rct diamond (nct03888066) is testing the impact on clinical outcomes of a strategy based on patiromer administration, compared with placebo, in patients with hfref who are hyperkalaemic while on raas inhibitors or with a history of hyperkalaemia with subsequent reduction or discontinuation of a raas inhibitor776,777 (see supplementary text 13.1). hyponatraemia is defined as a serum sodium concentration lower than 136 mmol/l. it is common in hf and may be present in up to 30% of patients admitted to hospital with hf. it reflects neurohormonal activation and is a powerful independent marker of poor outcomes in patients with acute or chronic hf.778,779 severe hyponatraemia may cause neurologic symptoms (seizures, obtundation, delirium) due to cerebral oedema and may require immediate treatment with hypertonic saline with serum sodium increases by 12 mmol/l per hour, though less than 8 mmol/l in 24 h as a more rapid correction increases the risk of myelinolysis. intravenous treatment is not required when hyponatraemia is less 3670 esc guidelines downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong

and in the absence of symptoms. as the pathogenesis of hyponatraemia in hf is dilutional, e.g. caused by water retention induced by increased vasopressin secretion, treatment is based on water restriction or vasopressin antagonists. fluid restrictions to less than 8001000 ml/day may be indicated to achieve a negative water balance and treat hyponatraemia. water restriction was associated with improved qol in a small, randomized study but with only slight increases in serum sodium in an observational registry.780,781 tolvaptan, an orally active selective arginine vasopressin v2 receptor antagonist, can be considered to increase serum sodium and diuresis in patients with persistent hyponatraemia and congestion. however, no effects on outcomes have been shown in rcts782785 (see supplementary text 13.1). the infusion of hypertonic saline combined with loop diuretics was associated with an increase in serum sodium levels and greater diuretic efficacy in small trials and observational studies.786788 hypochloraemia (<96 mmol/l) is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in patients with acute and chronic hf.439,789792 serum chloride may have a direct role in the control of renin secretion and the response to loop or thiazide diuretics.439,793 the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide increases chloride reabsorption causing a greater bicarbonate and sodium excretion in the proximal tubule of the nephron. it can increase serum chloride levels and diuresis in patients with severe hf at risk of diuretic resistance. 145,794 it is currently being tested in a multicentre randomized study in decompensated hf.469 13.8 lung disease, sleep-disordered breathing overall,copd affects about 20% of patientswith hf and has amajor impact on symptoms and outcomes.795797 due to the overlap in symptoms and signs, the differentiation between hf and copd may be difficult. pulmonary function testing with spirometry is recommended as the first diagnostic tool and should be considered in patients with suspected copd. for adequate interpretation, it should be performed in stable and euvolaemic patients to avoid congestion related to obstructive pulmonary function patterns. if there is uncertainty about the reversibility of airflow obstruction, pneumology referral for more sophisticated tests (bronchodilatatory test, bronchial provocation tests, diffusion capacity) is warranted.798,799 treatment of hf is generally well tolerated in copd.800 betablockers can worsen pulmonary function in individual patients but are not contraindicated in either copd or asthma, as stated in the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (gold) and the global initiative for asthma (gina), respectively.801,802 gina states that asthma should not be regarded as an absolute contraindication to the use of cardioselective beta-blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate, or nebivolol) with consideration of relative risks and benefits. in clinical practice, starting with low doses of cardioselective beta-blockers combined with close monitoring for signs of airway obstruction (wheezing, shortness of breath with lengthening of the expiration) should be encouraged. although not tested in hf patients, inhaled corticosteroids and beta-adrenergic agonists do not seem to increase cv events, including hf, in patients at high risk.803,804 moreover, optimal copd management can improve cardiac function.805 sleep-disordered breathing occurs in more than one third of patients with hf and is even more prevalent in patients with ahf. the most common types are: central sleep apnoea (csa, similar to cheyne-stokes respiration), osa, and a mixed pattern of the two. csa and osa have been shown to be associated with a worse prognosis in hf. osa is associated with an increased risk of incident hf in men. csa is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing in hfref and hfmref is the most common cause of csa.806,807 patients with hf can be investigated for sleep-disordered breathing. history taking should involve partners.questionnaires are instrumental in identifying patients at risk. home monitoring can usually identify and distinguish the type of sleep apnoea. however, overnight polysomnography remains the definitive investigation.807 the use of adaptive servo-ventilation in patients with hfref and predominantly csa is not recommended, based on the results of serve-hf, which was neutral regarding the composite primary endpoint of death from any cause or lifesaving cv intervention, but showed an increase in both all-cause mortality and cv mortality with adaptive servo-ventilation. 808 transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation was tested in a prospective, multicentre, randomized trial involving 151 patients with csa.809 the primary efficacy endpoint was the reduction of the apnoea-hypopnoea index from baseline to 6 months and was achieved by a larger percentage of patients with the active treatment. other measurements of sleep quality and qol were improved and no difference in any safety endpoint was found between active treatment and control.809 similar results were observed in the 96 patients with hf.810 patients with hfref being considered for a sleep-disordered breathing treatment with positive pressure airway mask must undergo formal sleep study to document the predominant type of sleep apnoea (central vs. obstructive). when sleep-disordered breathing is caused by osa, nocturnal hypoxaemia can be treated with nocturnal oxygen supplementation, continuous positive airway pressure, bi-level positive airway pressure, and adaptive servoventilation. however, none of these interventions has been shown to have beneficial effects on outcomes in hf.807 when sleepdisordered breathing is caused by csa, positive pressure airway masks are contraindicated in hfref patients.808 in these patients, implantable phrenic nerve stimulation can be considered for symptomatic relief. 13.9 hyperlipidaemia and lipid-modifying therapy two large rcts, including mainly patients with hfref, as well as a meta-analysis of 24 rcts, showed no benefit of statin treatment on cv mortality or stroke in patients with hfref.811,812 a reduction in hf hospitalizations as well as a small reduction in mi was observed in a meta-analysis of the corona and gissi-hf trials.813815 based on current evidence, routine administration of statins in patients with hf without other indications for their use (e.g. cad) is not esc guidelines 3671 downloaded from

discontinuation for patients already treated. 13.10 gout and arthritis hyperuricemia is a common finding in patients with chf with a prevalence up to 50%.816,817 hyperuricemia may be caused or aggravated by diuretic treatment and it is related to symptoms, exercise capacity, severity of diastolic dysfunction and long-term prognosis.817,818 for every 1 mg/dl increase in serum uric acid levels the risk of all-cause mortality and of hf hospitalization increases by 4% and 28%, respectively. 819 both febuxostat and allopurinol reduce uric acid levels. however, allopurinol was associated with a lower rate of all-cause death and cv death, compared with febuxostat, in a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority trial enrolling 6190 patients with gout and cv disease, 20% with hf, with a median follow-up of 32 months.820 allopurinol is therefore recommended as the firstchoice urate-lowering drug in hf patients with no contraindication. there is no evidence that uric acid-lowering treatment has beneficial effects on lv function, symptoms or outcomes of patients with hf.821823 with respect to treatment of acute gout attacks, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can worsen renal function and precipitate acute hf decompensation. colchicine should be preferred as it is associated with less side effects.824 however, it, too, should be used with caution in patients with severe renal dysfunction and is contraindicated in patients on dialysis. an increase in ventricular vulnerability was shown in experimental models.825 arthritis is a common comorbidity and is a common cause of both self-taken and prescribednsaids. these agents are relatively contraindicated as they may precipitate acute decompensation in patients with hf.826 rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a two- to threefold increase in the risk of hf and this increased risk is independent of ischaemic heart disease, suggesting a direct role in hf pathophysiology. 827,828 the safety of disease-modifying drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has not been established in hf. high doses of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha agents were associated with worsening hf in initial trials and should be used with caution. no adverse effects were noted with lower doses.829831 13.11 erectile dysfunction erectile dysfunction is a serious problem in hf patients due to its association with cv risk factors, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes), lifestyle (e.g. inactivity), and treatment (e.g. drugs).832 in the general population, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction is estimated to be 50% in men aged >_60, but erectile dysfunction can be present in up to 81% of cardiac patients across different cultures and ethnic groups.833 optimal assessment should include both questions assessing the presence of erectile dysfunction and factors that can be related to erectile dysfunction. numerous classes of cv drugs, particularly diuretics and beta-blockers, have been implicated causing erectile dysfunction. however, the relationships between many contemporary cv drugs and erectile dysfunction is not clear.834 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are generally safe and effective in patients with compensated hf.834,835 no studies have shown one agent to be more effective or safer than the others. however, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should not be used in patients receiving nitrates and nitrates should not be administered to patients within 24 h of sildenafil or vardenafil administration or within 48 h of tadalafil administration.834 13.12 depression depression affects 20% of patients with hf and is severe in half of them. its occurrence is higher in women and it is associated with worse clinical status and a poor prognosis.836838 screening using a validated questionnaire is recommended when there is a clinical suspicion of depression. the beck depression inventory and cardiac depression scale are the tools formally validated for the assessment of depression in patients with hf. other questionnaires (e.g. geriatric depression scale, hamilton depression scale, hospital anxiety and depression scale) can also be used.837,838 there is still no consensus on the best therapy for hf patients with depression. psychosocial intervention may improve depressive symptoms but has no effect on prognosis of depressed patients with hf.839 depressive symptoms may improve with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors but trials specifically designed to assess the effect of these drugs in patients with hf and depression have failed to show any significant benefit over placebo on both symptoms and outcomes. 840,841 interestingly, patients improved also in the placebo arm showing the importance of better care in these patients. both trials showed the safety of sertraline and escitalopram, respectively.840,841 tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided for the treatment of depression in hf as they may cause hypotension, worsening hf, and arrhythmias.837,838 13.13 cancer hf occurs in patients with cancer as a result of the interaction among anticancer therapy, cancer itself, and patients’ cv background (risk factors and coexisting cv disease).842846 several anticancer therapies may cause hf directly, thorough their cardiotoxic effects (table 23), or, indirectly, through other mechanisms, such as myocarditis, ischaemia, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias or valve disease.844,845,847852 hf, in turn, may affect cancer outcomes by depriving patients of effective anticancer therapies.699 some epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests a further reciprocal interaction between cancer and hf with some, though not all, studies showing a higher incidence rate of cancer in patients with hf.853858 the prevention of hf in patients with cancer undergoing potential cardiotoxic therapies requires careful patient’s assessment and management before, during, and after cancer therapy, preferably in the context of an integrated cardio-oncology service (figure 18).845,859,860 a cv baseline risk assessment for all patients scheduled to receive potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies using the hfa-icos risk assessment is advisable.846 baseline cv risk assessment forms have been developed for different potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies. history of hf or cmp characterizes patients as being at very high risk or at high risk for all cancer therapies, except anti-androgen treatments for prostate cancer. an lvef <50% is an additional factor for high-risk patients and elevated levels 3672 esc guidelines downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong

criteria of medium risk for most of the cancer treatments.846 during cancer treatment with potential cardiotoxic therapies, lv systolic function can be monitored through echocardiography. chemotherapy should be reconsidered and treatment with an ace-i and a beta-blocker (preferably carvedilol) should be started in patients who develop lv systolic dysfunction, defined as 10% or more absolute reduction in lvef to a value below 50%.844,861864 global longitudinal strain can detect cardiac dysfunction at an earlier stage.865,866 a >_12% relative reduction in global longitudinal strain was compared with an lvef decline in a prospective randomized trial in high-risk patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. compared to treatment based on lvef, treatment based on changes in global longitudinal strain led to the same decrease in lvef (primary endpoint) but with fewer patients who developed cardiac dysfunction at the end of the study, thus suggesting usefulness of global longitudinal strain for the early detection of cardiotoxicity.867 promising results for the early detection of cardiac dysfunction have also been obtained through monitoring of biomarkers, such as nps and troponin.868,869 patients on immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors are at increased risk of myocarditis and should be monitored for related symptoms and signs and by weekly assessment of cardiac troponin during at least the first 6 weeks of therapy and managed accordingly.870 timing of the imaging procedures and biomarkers assessment depend on the anticancer treatment and patient’s risk profile (figure 18).865 in general, all patients scheduled for potential cardiotoxic therapies must undergo a baseline evaluation that would define the level of risk for cardiotoxicity (low, medium, or high) and the intensity of monitoring and follow-up during and after cancer treatment.865 cancer survivors exposed to potentially cardiotoxic therapies should be periodically monitored in the long term as hf may develop several years after cancer therapy.865,871 table 23 cancer drugs causing heart failure cancer therapy indication anthracycline chemotherapy

leading to cardiac dysfunction and hf and this risk is greater in patients with a history of hf.873875 more recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) pandemic has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality as well as of hf decompensation.873,876878 specific guidance is available.879 general recommendations related to infections are given in table 24. influenza vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause death in patients with hf in observational studies and retrospective analyses.880882 influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, as well as covid-19 vaccination, when available, should be considered in patients with hf.879,883 14 special conditions 14.1 pregnancy 14.1.1 pregnancy in pre-existing heart failure women with pre-existing hf have a higher risk of pregnancy-related cv complications including hf decompensation. moderate- and high-risk patients according to the modified world health organization (mwho) class iiiiv should be referred to a specialist centre with a multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team.884 an algorithm for themanagement of hf patients before and during pregnancy is reported in figure 19. pre-pregnancy management includes the modification of existing hf medications to avoid foetal harm. ace-is, arbs, arni, mras, ivabradine, and sglt2 inhibitors are contraindicated and should be stopped prior to conception with close clinical and echocardiographic monitoring. beta-blockers should be continued and switched to beta-1-selective blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate). hydralazine, oral nitrates and methyldopa can be started if required. therapeutic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (lmwh), in the first and last trimesters, and vkas, with the usual target international normalized ratios (inrs) or lmwh for the second trimester, is recommended for patients with hf and af. doacs should be avoided.884 assessment of patients with hf in pre-pregnancy or at presentation with a new pregnancy should include a clinical assessment (symptoms, clinical examination, bp, sao2), ecg and resting echocardiography. the modalities of delivery should be planned by

mortality ranging from 2.0% in germany to 12.6% in a 206 ppcmpatient cohort from south africa.643 ppcm frequently presents with acute hf but may also present with ventricular arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest. an lvef <30%, marked lv dilatation, lv end-diastolic diameter >6.0 cm, and rv involvement are associated with adverse outcomes.643 cardiac recovery may occur in the first 36 months though it may be delayed to up to 2 years. recovery rates vary among regions, from 75% to less than 50%.886888 assessment and management of pregnant patients presenting with hf depends upon the clinical setting and severity of presentation. detailed cardiac assessment with echocardiography, np levels, foetal ultrasound and foetal monitoring is recommended. in cases of new hf or if there is diagnostic uncertainty non-contrast cmr may be considered. milder cases can be treated with oral diuretics, beta-blockers, hydralazine and oral nitrates. pregnant women presenting with signs of acute hf require urgent hospital admission. in case of ppcm presenting with severe hf and cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic or vasopressor support, transfer to an advanced hf centre, where ecmo, lvad and/or cardiac transplantation can be performed, is recommended. urgent delivery by caesarean section (irrespective of gestation) should be considered with mcs immediately available. adrenergic agents (dobutamine, adrenaline) may have detrimental effects.889when a ppcm patient is haemodynamically unstable, levosimendan or mcs may be considered. lvad implantation as a btt or btr should be considered in refractory cases of cardiogenic shock.643 bromocriptine has been proposed for patients with acute ppcm to reduce the production of a cleaved 16 kda prolactin fragment, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of ppcm. bromocriptine was tested in a randomized trial in 63 patients comparing its long-term, 8 weeks, with its short-term, 1-week, treatment. it was associated with recovery of lv function, with no difference between the two regimens and in line with the results of a previous international ppcm registry.890,891 bromocriptine may be considered for treatment of ppcm. untoward effects of treatment, including deep venous thrombosis and cessation of lactation, must be considered if it is initiated. it should therefore be accompanied by prophylactic (or therapeutic) anticoagulation. 14.2 cardiomyopathies 14.2.1 epidemiology and diagnosis cmps can be either inherited (genetic/familial) and/or acquired. they can also be accelerated by diseasemodifiers.892894 they are a heterogeneous group of diseases and are major causes of hf.895 dcm has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 250 to 1 in 500 of the general population, hcm ranges between 1 in 500 to 1 in 5000, and ac is estimated to be present in around 1 in 1000 to 1 in 5000 persons.895,896 direct causes of cmps include pathogenic gene variants (mutations), toxins, auto-immunity, storage diseases, infections, and tachyarrhythmias. disease modifiers, conditions that may aggravate or trigger a cmp, include epigenetic factors and acquired modifiers, such as pregnancy and most cv comorbidities. it is important to consider this key interaction between genetic and acquired causes during the diagnostic workup.897 identification of an acquired cause of the cmp does not exclude an underlying pathogenic gene variant, whereas the latter may require an additional acquired cause and/or disease modifier to become manifest clinically. the commonest causes and disease modifiers are shown in table 25. the key elements of the diagnostic workup for all patients with hf and cmp are reported in table 26.892,894,895,898,899 specifics aspects of diagnosis and treatment are summarized in tables 2729. clinical history, laboratory tests, and imaging are the first-line investigations. echocardiography is central for the diagnosis and monitoring of hcm, dcm, and ac. cmr imaging provides more detailed morphological and prognostic information and should be performed at baseline. the prevalence of gene mutations may vary according to the morphological phenotype or the underlying acquired cause. gene mutations occur in up to 40% of dcm, 60% of hcm, and 15% in chemotherapy-induced, alcoholic or peripartum cmps.895,898,900905 the prevalence of genetic mutations is over 10% also in non-familial dcm.898,906 finding a pathogenic gene variant in a patient with cmp allows better prediction of the disease outcome and progression, may contribute to the indications for device implantation and informgenetic counselling for families. endomyocardial biopsy (emb) with immunohistochemical quantification of inflammatory cells remains the gold standard investigation for the identification of cardiac inflammation. it may confirm the diagnosis of auto-immune disease in patients with dcm and suspected giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, vasculitis and sarcoidosis. 893,907 it may also help for the diagnosis of storage diseases, including amyloid or fabry disease, if imaging or genetic testing does not provide a definitive diagnosis (see also section 14.6). emb might be considered also in hcm if genetic or acquired causes cannot be identified. the risks and benefits of ebm should be evaluated and this procedure should be reserved for specific situations where its results may affect treatment. 14.2.2 treatment the current pharmacological treatment of hf in dcm, hcm, or ac patients does not differ from general hf management, except for peculiar aspects reported in tables 2729. a pilot randomized study, tred-hf, investigated the possibility of withdrawing medical treatment in those patients with non-ischaemic dcm who had had partial to complete recovery of lvef (>40%). however, relapse of dcm within 6 months was observed in 44% of patients, and rapid lv remodelling with early tissue and functional changes, even amongst patients who did not relapse, was found.271,908 in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (explorer-hcm), treatment with mavacamten improved exercise capacity, lvot obstruction, nyha functional class, and health status in patients with obstructive hcm. this offers the possibility of disease-specific treatment for inherited cmps. 909 icd implantation should be considered for patients with dcm, hcm, or ac (see section 6).895,910912 the strength of the indication varies according to the clinical risk factors for sudden cardiac death with higher priority being given to those patients with significant lge esc

consequences.606,940,941 it has been suggested that atrial disease links the pathophysiology of hf, especially hfpef, with af, as they often coexist, are closely inter-related and share common risk factors.606,685,942,943 14.4.2 diagnosis atrial size and function can be evaluated by multimodality imaging including two- and three-dimensional echocardiography, myocardial deformation, computed tomography (ct) and cmr.944 cardiac biomarkers, including high-sensitivity cardiac troponins and nps, may assess pathophysiological aspects of atrial disease. 945947 the increased levels of nps in af may also be an indicator of an underlying atrial disease.942,948 a comprehensive characterization of atrial disease combining clinical, imaging, biochemical and molecular features is, however, still lacking. 14.4.3 management atrial disease is an emerging therapeutic target in the prevention of af, systemic thromboembolism, and perhaps hfpef.949 as atrial disease appears to result from the intersection of shared risk factors and comorbidities predisposing to both af and hf, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity may be of paramount importance for its development.7,950 effective management of hf and af (see section 12.1.1), as well as treatment of mitral regurgitation (see section 12.3.3), may also be important to counteract atrial disease progression. 14.5 myocarditis 14.5.1 epidemiology and diagnosis the incidence of acute myocarditis is estimated to be 1.5 million cases per year globally.951 the contribution of myocarditis as a cause of hf varies by age and region from approximately 0.5% to 4.0%.918,952 chronic, emb proven, inflammation can be found in 9% to 30% of adult patients with a dcm.918,953 the most frequent potential aetiologies triggering acute myocarditis in europe are reported in table 30. the clinical presentation of acute myocarditis may vary from mild symptoms to cardiogenic shock. workup for the diagnosis of acute myocarditis in patients with hf is reported in table 31 and figure 20. specific criteria about biopsies and cmr are reported in tables 32 and 33. 14.5.2 treatment hospitalization for at least 48 h may be useful for patients with acute myocarditis and hf, especially when troponins are elevated and when cardiac dysfunction, and/or arrhythmias are present at initial presentation. despite the lack of evidence in the specific setting of acutemyocarditis, treatment of hfref is recommended in the presence of systolic lv dysfunction. immunosuppression is only indicated in selected cases of acute myocarditis (table 34). once cardiac enzymes decrease, arrhythmias are absent, and cardiac systolic dysfunction is stabilized, standard hf therapy should be continued for at least 6 months (see also figure 20). immunosuppression has been considered for treatment of patients with chronic cardiac inflammation at emb and no evidence of active viral infection.918,919 this was associated with an improvement in cardiac function in small studies and with better outcomes in a retrospective observational study.953,963,964 prospective trials with old or newer immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory drugs are needed. a placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of immunoadsorption with i.v. immunoglobulins on lv function is ongoing and other treatment options are being tested.919 14.6 amyloidosis 14.6.1 epidemiology and diagnosis ca or amyloid cardiomyopathy is still an underdiagnosed cause of hf.895,965,966 the two most prevalent forms of ca are light chain immunoglobulin (al) and transthyretin (attr) amyloidosis. attr includes the wild-type (>90% of cases), and the hereditary or variant type (<10% of cases). it is estimated that 6% to 16% of all patients table 30 aetiologies

recently reviewed.973 age >65 years and hf along with a lv wall thickness >12 mm at echocardiography are major criteria for the suspicion of ca.973 criteria for a suspicion of ca and to confirm diagnosis are reported in table 35, supplementary table 25, and figure 21.973,974 cardiac imaging and emb or extra-cardiac biopsy are needed for the diagnosis of al-ca in patients with abnormal haematological tests (figure 21). technetium-labelled 99mtc-pyp or dpd or hmdp scintigraphy with planar and spect imaging has a specificity and positive predictive value for ttr-ca of up to 100%.975 in contrast, cmr has a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 92%, respectively.966,976 the hereditary form should be excluded by genetic testing. emb is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ttr-ca

scintigraphy with spect (figure 21).973 14.6.2 therapy of amyloidosis and heart failure maintenance of euvolaemia is central to management but is challenging due to the markedly reduced ventricular capacitance.977 if hf symptoms are present, a loop diuretic, possibly with an mra, may be given, but orthostatic hypotension may cause intolerance. beta-blockers, digitalis, ace-i, arbs, or arni may not be well tolerated because of hypotension, and their place in ca treatment is unsettled. their withdrawal must be often considered due to hypotension and/or bradycardia.973,974 ccb should be avoided as they may cause severe hypotension and fatigue, or form complexes with amyloid.966 amyloid infiltration of the atrial wall leads to atrial myopathy and electromechanical dissociation with high embolic risk. patients with ca and history of af should receive anticoagulation. there is no evidence to support anticoagulation for patients in sr, yet.7,978 amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic agent.973 therapy of al-ca is based on treatment of the underlying haematological problem with chemotherapy or autologous stem-cell transplant. ttr stabilization and reduction of its production are the basis of ttr-ca treatment. liver and/or cardiac transplantation can be considered only in end-stage disease of familial ttr-ca. tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and cv hospitalizations in cardiac or non-cardiac biopsy-proven hereditary and wtttr-ca, mainly in those patients with nyha class i and ii at baseline. functional improvement occurred within 6 months, whereas the decrease in mortality took nearly 2 years to occur.979,980 intravenous patisiran, a small rna interfering molecule, or subcutaneous inotersen, antisense oligonucleotide against ttr, may be considered in those patients with combined httrpolyneuropathy and ca (figure 21).981,982 off-label use of diflunisal may be considered in wtttr-ca in combination with a proton pump inhibitor.983 14.7 iron overload cardiomyopathy iron overload results either from genetically determined increased intestinal iron absorption in the context of hereditary haemochromatosis (primary iron overload) or from multiple blood transfusions required for the management of haematological conditions such as beta-thalassaemia (secondary iron overload).984 in iron overload, the iron binding capacity of transferrin is saturated and non-transferrin-bound iron enters cardiomyocytes through ltype calcium channels, causing oxidative myocardial damage.985 table 33 cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with suspected myocarditis955,956 indication indicated at baseline, in all patients with clinical history þ ecg, elevated troponin or echocardiographic abnormalities, and significant cad excluded or unlikely. advised at follow-up in patients with persistent dysfunction at echocardiography, arrhythmias or ecg abnormalities.a main findings at baseline: t1-weighted (inflammation, injury) and t2-weighted (oedema) sequences, extracellular volume and lge within 2 weeks after symptom onset.956,960 at follow up: lge to evaluate the degree of scarring, t1 and t2 to identify persistent inflammation.a diagnostic significance at least one t2-based criterion (global or regional increase of myocardial t2 relaxation time or an increased signal intensity in t2-weighted images), with at least one t1-based criterion (increased myocardial t1, extracellular volume, or lge) in the acute phase. only one (i.e., t2-based or t1-based) marker may still support a diagnosis of acute myocardial inflammation in an appropriate clinical scenario, albeit with less specificity in the acute phase. a negative t1/t2 scan does not exclude a still ongoing inflammatory process in the chronic phase.a cad= coronary artery disease; cmr= cardiac magnetic resonance; ecg = electrocardiogram; lge = late gadolinium enhancement. ait takes at least 3 months before cmr signs of oedema (secondary to inflammation in the acute phase/baseline) disappear. at 6 months, t1 or t2 signs of oedema should have disappeared if inflammation would be completely absent. still, the absence of t1 or t2 oedema does not exclude chronic low-grade inflammation. table 34 treatment and follow-up of acute myocarditis hf therapy should be started if lv systolic dysfunction is present at presentation and should be continued for at least 6 months upon complete functional recovery (ef >50%).918,919 immunosuppression for at least 612 months is required in acute myocarditis with clinical or emb evidence of auto-immune disease, including giant cell myocarditis, vasculitis or sarcoidosis.98,917919,953,954,961 immunosuppression is not advised on a routine basis in acute myocarditis without clinical or emb-based evidence of auto-immune disease.917 initial empirical administration of i.v. corticosteroids may be taken into consideration in cases of high suspicion of immune-mediated myocarditis especially if complicated by acute hf, malignant arrhythmias and/or high degree av block.954,962 intense sporting activities should be avoided as long as symptoms, cardiac enzymes elevated or ecg/imaging abnormalities are present and last for at least 6 months since complete recovery.936 yearly follow-up for at least 4 years, with an ecg and echocardiography, is needed as acute myocarditis

a restrictive or a dilated phenotype, the former potentially evolving to the latter as the disease advances. myocardial iron deposition can be accurately estimated by the cmrt2* technique; t2* values are correlated with left and right ventricular systolic function and predict the development of iron-induced hf or arrhythmias.984 prevention of iocm is successfully accomplished with iron chelators, including deferoxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox, while established iocm may be completely reversed by intensified and combined iron chelation therapy.985 14.8 adult congenital heart disease the management of achd has been reviewed in detail in a recent esc guideline.988 hf is a common problem affecting 2050% of the achd population, and an important cause of death.989 the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in achd is often different from non-congenital (acquired) heart disease, in particular in those with: a systemic right ventricle (rv), a failing subpulmonary ventricle, a single ventricle,988 surgery-related injury, chronic pressure/volume overload in systemic and sub-pulmonary ventricles, and those with hypertrophy or non-compaction induced by gene mutations. therefore, extrapolation of current hf treatment guidelines to achd patients is not always appropriate. in addition, the few available data on hf treatments in achd patients are often inconclusive and are derived from small patient cohorts. as a consequence, achd specific recommendations are mostly based on clinical experience or position statements.990 importantly, achd patients with hf should be referred to expert centres. the general principles of management, while awaiting transfer to specialist centres, is summarized in table 36. table 35 “red flags” for most common forms of cardiac

(2) measurement of nps and echocardiography have key roles in the diagnosis of hf. (3) ace-i or arni, beta-blockers, mra, and sglt2 inhibitors are recommended as cornerstone therapies for patients with hfref. (4) icds are recommended in selected patients with hfref of an ischaemic aetiology and should be considered in those with a nonischaemic aetiology. (5) crt-p/d is recommended in those patients with hfref, in sinus rhythm, with a lbbb >_150 ms and should be considered in those with a lbbb >_130149 ms or non-lbbb >_150 ms. (6) advanced hf strategies (heart transplantation/mcs) may be appropriate in selected patients. (7) ace-i/arni, beta-blockers, and mra may be considered in patients with hfmref. (8) the diagnosis of hfpef requires objective evidence of cardiac structural, or functional abnormalities as well as elevated plasma np concentrations consistent with the presence of lv diastolic dysfunction and raised lv filling pressures. a diastolic stress test is recommended when these markers are equivocal. (9) to date, no treatment has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with hfpef. (10) it is recommended that all patients with hf be enrolled in a multidisciplinary hf-mp. (11) exercise is recommended for all patients who are able, to improve exercise capacity andqol, and reduce hf hospitalization. (12) patients with advanced hf refractory to medical/device therapy and who do not have absolute contraindications should be referred for consideration of heart transplantation. mcs should also be considered as btt ordt in selected patients. (13) four major clinical presentations of acute hf may occur: adhf, acute pulmonary oedema, rv failure, and cardiogenic shock. (14) treatment of acute hf is based on diuretics for congestion, inotropes, and short- term mcs for peripheral hypoperfusion. (15) patients hospitalized for hf should be carefully evaluated to exclude persistent signs of congestion. oral treatment should be optimized before discharge. (16) in addition to oral anticoagulation, a strategy of rhythm control including catheter ablation should be considered in patients whose symptoms and/or cardiac dysfunction are associated with af. (17) savr or tavi, as advised by the heart team, are recommended in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. (18) patients with isolated significant smr and coapt criteria should be considered for percutaneous edge-to-edge repair, whereas those with smr and cad, who need revascularization, should be considered for surgery. (19) it is recommended that patients with type ii diabetes are treated with sglt2 inhibitors. (20) patients should be periodically screened for anaemia and iron deficiency and i.v. iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose should be considered in symptomatic patients with lvef <45% and iron deficiency, and in patients recently hospitalized for hf and with lvef <_50% and iron deficiency. table 36 treatment of adult congenital heart disease and heart failure in specialized centres achd patients with chronic hf should be referred to specialized centres. specific guidelines for medical treatment of chronic hf in achd are lacking, and practitioners should follow the current guidelines for medical treatment of hf. it remains unknown whether the long-term use of neurohormonal modulators affects clinical outcomes and prognosis in achd. sacubitril/valsartan may decrease morbidity,991993 however, no recommendation can be made at this moment based on the retrospective or anecdotical nature of these observations. co-morbidities in hf such as diabetes mellitus, af, csa, iron deficiency, and cachexia should be treated according to specific recommendations reported in this document. in a biventricular circulation, patients with an impaired systemic lv should be treated with conventional hf therapy; this may also be considered in symptomatic patients with a failing systemic right ventricle. diuretics are recommended to control symptoms of fluid retention. treatment of symptomatic patients with a failing single ventricle in a fontan circulation, or in the case of a persistent right-to-left shunt, should always be carefully initiated, taking the labile balance of ventricular preload and systemic afterload into account. crt may be a therapeutic option in achd patients with hf, but evidence in this specific setting is still lacking. efficacy of crt will depend on the underlying structural and functional substrate, such as anatomy of the systemic ventricle (left, right, or functionally single), presence and degree of structural systemic av valve regurgitation, primary myocardial disease or scarring, and type of electrical conduction delay.988 treatment of acute hf in achd patients should be in an expert centre, with proper knowledge of inotropes, the availability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and advanced bridging techniques.988,994 timely evaluation for transplantation by achd hf specialists in a transplant centre with achd expertise is recommended. ventricular assist devices can bridge patients to transplantation, or in a subgroup of patients, may be an option as destination therapy. achd= adult congenital heart disease; af = atrial fibrillation; av = atrioventricular; crt = cardiac resynchronization therapy; csa = central sleep apnoea; hf = heart failure; lv = left ventricular. esc 2021 3688 esc guidelines downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by hong kong metropolitan university user on 08 april 2025 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 gaps in evidence major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hf have occurred over recent years. strong evidence for new treatment options have been given by recent rcts and hf management may undergo major changes in the next years. new discoveries, however, pose new challenges and many areas with lack of evidence still remain. the following is a short list of selected, common issues that deserve to be addressed in future clinical research. (1) definition and epidemiology i. further research into the underlying characteristics, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of hfmref and hfpef ii. consensus about normal values/ranges of ef iii. better
