college london in london. the aim of the symposium was to have a better understanding of health and social challenges for aging and long-term care in china. this symposium draws research insights from a wide range of disciplines, including eco- nomics, public policy, demography, gerontology, public health and sociology. a total of 20 participants from eight countries, seek to identify the key issues and research priorities in the area of aging and long-term care in china. the results published here are a synthesis of the top four research areas that represent the perspectives from some of the leading researchers in the field.   keywords healthy aging, long-term care, china    population aging has created an unprecedented global chal-            means that the government should
