chellappandian et al., 2018). essential oils can be extracted from the whole plant or from isolated parts in order to obtain higher concentrations of a specific compound. since antiquity, essential oils have been used due to their repellent, insecticidal, fungicidal, nematicidal, and bactericidal activities. they are considered safer than synthetic pesticides, having been used for human consumption and as medicines for thousands of years. they might be less toxic to nontarget organisms, such as humans, and have low impacts in the environment. therefore, essential oils are a promising option for substituting the synthetic pesticides used in agriculture (benelli and pavela, 2018; de oliveira et al., 2018a, 2018b; ponsankar et al., 2016). neem oil, which is extracted from the indian neem tree (azadirachta indica juss.), is valued worldwide for use in the areas of human health and pest control (lokanadhan et al., n.d.). neem oil contains n300 biologically active compounds, with the major constituents being triterpenes known as limonoids (fig. 1), the most important of which is azadirachtin (chandramohan et al., 2016; gupta et al., 2017; nicoletti et al., 2012). neem oil is effective against a wide range of pests, exhibiting a broad spectrum of action due to its systemic and transmembrane activities. it inhibits feeding, reduces ecdysone,motion, and flight activity, deregulates development, suppresses fertility and reproduction, and acts as a repellent (campos et al., 2016). in addition, neemoil can act as a fertilizer, improving the quality of soil for crop production, hence contributing to sustainable organic agriculture. however, its use in the field is limited by its short persistence in the environment (kumar et al., 2018; shah et al., 2017). the application of nanotechnology in agriculture emphasizes the goal of the development of clean, safe, and environmentally friendly nanomaterials, using biocompatible and nontoxic solvents, biodegradable and biocompatible natural matrices, and energy-efficient and sustainable processes (ashoka et al., 2017; bai et al., 2018; saratale et al., 2018). nanocarriers are capable of increasing the solubility of active compounds, while protecting them from volatilization and from degradation. the improvements in efficiency can generate better results, using lower doses and numbers of applications, hence contributing to the reduction of both environmental contamination and risks to human health (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; choudhary et al., 2017; oliveira et al., 2018). different types of nanoparticle formulations are fig. 1. chemical structures of the main active compounds of neem oil. 58 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 used in agriculture as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, fertilizers, and growth regulators, among others (pascoli et al., 2018b). the use of polymeric nanoparticles as sustained release systems in agriculture has shown excellent results, due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; de oliveira et al., 2018a; de oliveira et al., 2018b; oliveira et al., 2018). several studies have demonstrated the potential of formulations of biopesticides associated with polymeric nanoparticles (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; de oliveira et al., 2018a; de oliveira et al., 2018b; maruyama et al., 2016; oliveira et al., 2018; pascoli et al., 2018a, 2018b). zein nanoparticles meet the requirements of environmentally friendly nanotechnology, since zein is a naturally product that is biodegradable and biocompatible. it represents the main protein content of corn, is composed of lipophilic amino acid residues, and is not used for direct human consumption, due to its negative nitrogen balance and low water solubility (paliwal and palakurthi, 2014). due to its high coating capacity, zein is used in the production of nanocarrier systems, employing a low toxicity solvent, such as ethanol, which is evaporated during the synthesis, hence causing no harm to the environment when the formulation is used in the field. nanoparticles are capable of modifying the properties of the active substances that encapsulated, so, it is necessary to re-screen the material in order to ensure its safe use. this involves assays using target and nontarget organisms, as well as evaluation of the behaviors of newformulations in the environment, aiming at regulation of the use of biopesticides associatedwith nanomaterials in crop protection (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; dere et al., 2015; fraceto et al., 2016; pascoli et al., 2018a, 2018b; sola et al., 2014). given this background, the innovation of this study was to develop neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles. in addition to preparation and characterization of the nanocarriers, using the novel safe by design strategy their potential toxicity was evaluated by investigating their effects on nontarget organisms (allium cepa, nitrogen cycle bacteria, and caenorhabditis elegans). the choice was because they are model organisms, all are used in the research of toxicity of materialsmaking possible a broad investigation of the possible action of zein nanoparticles loaded with neem oil, since they are in different classes of organisms (plant, nematodes and microorganisms) that can come into contact with this new biopesticide in the crops. the work opens perspectives for the use of nanobiopesticides based on neem oil in crop protection, contributing to sustainable organic agriculture aswell as improved food safety. 2. materials andmethods 2.1. materials zein and pluronic f-68 were purchased from sigma-aldrich. neem oil (azamax) containing 12 g/ml of azadirachtin was acquired from upl brazil. ethanol was obtained from labsynth. allium cepa seeds were purchased from isla seeds (brazilian company). the soil used was obtained from a local agricultural supplier. c. elegans n2 (wild type) and cl2166 (dvis19 [(gst-4p::gfp::nls] iii) strainswere purchased from the caenorhabitis genetics center, minnesota, usa. other chemicals and solvents used were analytical grade and were purchased from local suppliers. 2.2. preparation of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles zein nanoparticles were prepared by the environmentally-friendly antisolvent precipitation method (hu and mcclements, 2014) with some modifications (pascoli et al., 2018a). the antisolvent method is a principlewhere the active compound is dissolved in a solvent; the solution is then injected with an antisolvent solution (in which the compound is insoluble). the compound precipitates as a consequence of the change of supersaturation caused by mixing the solution and the antisolvent solution. in this way, zein powder (2% w/v) was added to an aqueous solution of ethanol (85% v/v) and kept under magnetic stirring overnight. the zein solution was adjusted to ph 5.8, heattreated at 75 °c for 15 min for protein densification, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane (millipore) to remove insoluble particles. a 100 mg quantity of neem oil (in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate containing 12 g/l of azadirachtin)was added to the zein solution. an aqueous solution of pluronic f-68 (a block-copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (c3h6o·c2h4o)x) extensively used as surfactant, wetting agents and emulsifiers) (2% v/v) was prepared and was adjusted to ph 4. the presence of pluronic f-68 decreased the surface tension of the nanoparticles andmaintains the stability of the nanoparticles in suspension. using a syringe, the zein solution was rapidly injected into the pluronic solution, under stirring. the resulting colloidal dispersion was stirred for 12 h, at roomtemperature, in order to evaporate the ethanol, and water (ph 4.0) was then added to make up the original volume. the final concentration of neem oil in the nanoformulation was 5 mg/ml. this concentrationwas chosen since in agriculture, neemoil is used at concentrations of between 4 and 6mg/ml as recommended by the manufacturer upl brazil. 2.3. nanoparticle physicochemical characterization the nanoparticle mean size distribution and polydispersity index (an indicator of the homo/heterogeneity of the size distribution of particles calculated by the square of the standard deviation divided by the square of themean size)were determined by the dynamic light scattering technique (dls). the zeta potentialwasmeasured by the microelectrophoresis method. these analyses were performed using a zetasizer nano zs90 system (malvern instruments, uk) at a fixed angle of 90° and 25 °c. the nanoparticle concentrations, size distributions, and span values (an additional parameter to show thewidth of the size distribution calculated as span=(d90−d10) /d50 being that d10, d50 and d90 refer, respectively, to the diameters where 10%, 50% and 90% of the particle population were also measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (nta), using a nanosight lm 10 cell (green laserwithwavelength of 532 nm) and a scmos camera, controlled by nanosight v. 3.2 software (grillo et al., 2012, 2014). for these analyses, the samples were diluted 1000× in ultrapure water and in liquid medium (0.5% saline solution), at the highest concentration used in the c. elegans assay. stability analyses were performed using sample aliquots removed after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 min of incubation in the saline solution. each result was expressed as the average of three determinations. aliquots of zein nanoparticles and neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles were collected and diluted in ultrapure water. samples were dripped onto a silicon plate afm sampler and kept in a desiccator for complete drying. the samples were analyzed using an easy scan 2 basic bt02217 atomic force microscope (nanosurf, switzerland) operated in noncontact mode with tapal-g cantilevers (budgetsensors, bulgaria) and tip voltage of 90 hz. the acquired images were analyzed using gwyddion software. 2.4. toxicity studies 2.4.1. allium cepa assay based on the procedure described by de lima et al. (2010) germinated a. cepa seeds were exposed to the nanoformulations (zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles), neem oil (at a concentration of 5 mg/ml), pluronic f-68 surfactant, and ultrapure water (negative control) in 10 ml glass beaker, in dark conditions for periods of 24 h. 10 roots were exposed to each treatment. the roots were fixed in carnoy's reagent (methanol:acetic acid, 3:1 v/v), followed by acid hydrolysis with 1 mol/l hcl at 60 °c during 9 min. the roots were stained with schiff reagent for 2 h. for preparation of the slides, the meristematic region was crushed in one drop of 2% aceticcarmine, using a cover slip. three roots exposed for each treatment were used to prepare the slides and all the cells were analyzed. this m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 59 assay was repeated three independent times in different days. calculations were made of the mitotic index (mi), the damage index (di), and the relative index (ri) which are indicators of the presence of cytotoxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential agents in the environment. mi was calculated by dividing the number of cells in division by the total number of cells. di was calculated by dividing the number of cells showing dna alterations during the mitosis by the total number of cells in division. ri was calculated by dividing the values obtained for the treatments by the values for the negative control. 2.4.2. molecular analysis of the effects of the nanoparticles on soil microbiota we investigated the changes in all genes from the n cycle due the importance of this cycle for the nitrogen fixation in soil making the soil fertile by converting nitrogen into bioavailable forms that can be assimilated by living beings for production of organic molecules such as amino acids proteins and nucleic acids. therefore, the quantification of these functional genes involved in n transformation performed in this work improves our understanding of n-cycling soil microbiota responses to environmental impact (hirsch and mauchline, 2015; fang et al., 2019). before use, the fertilized commercial soil (14% organic matter, ph 6.80) was sieved using a 0.2 micrometer sieve, dried and separated into vessels with surface area of 0.025 m2 each, and kept moist in a heated cabinet at 25 °c for 15 days. two untreated soil samples were used as the negative control. each treatment (zein nanoparticles, neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neemoil)were tested in duplicates (two vessels containing soil for each treatment). the applications of the formulations (using sprays) were based on the dosage and number of applications of neemoil employed in the field (three applications were performed on the samesample at 7-day intervals, using a 5mg/ml solution at a dosage of 100 l/ha). the extraction of dna from soil microorganisms was performed 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after the first application of the treatments, using a power soil dna isolation kit (mobio laboratories). quantification of the genetic material was performed by fluorescence, using a qubit 3.0 fluorometer with the qubit dsdna br assay kit (invitrogen). all the samples were diluted to final concentrations of 1000 ng/ml. real-time polymerase chain reactions (qpcr) were performed for specific genes from nitrogen cycle bacteria: nifh (nitrogen fixation), nirk, nirs, narg, cnorb, and nosz (denitrification). the bacterial 16s rna gene was used as a reference. the reactions were performed using 1 μl of dna sample, 12.5 μl of planium sybr green qpcr supermix-udg with rox (invitrogen), 1 μl of each primer (sense and antisense), and sufficient ultrapure water to complete the final volume to 25 μl. the amplifications were conducted according to a procedure adapted from jung et al. (2011) using a stepone thermocycler (applied biosystems),with an initial denaturation at 95 °c for 3min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 45 s, 60 °c for 45 s, and 72 °c for 45 s. the sybr green fluorescence emittedwas measured at the end of each incubation at 72 °c. the resultswere analyzed using relative quantification,with calculation of δδct (2−δδct), employing 16s rrna as the reference gene and the initial soil as the reference sample (yuan et al., 2008). the calculations were performed using the stepone plus v2. 3 software of the equipment. 2.4.3. caenorhabditis elegans assays c. elegans trains n2 (wild type, established as valuable experimental model due to the high level of genetic homology with humans, fast life cycle, easymaintenance and handling) and cl2166 (genetically equal to wildtype and tagged to green fluorescent protein, gfp, fused to the promoter of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-s-transferase-4) were maintained in plates containing ngm (nematode growth media) enriched with salts and seeded with the bacterium e. coli op50, at 20 °c. the fertilized nematodes were synchronized by lysing them with a bleaching mixture (1% naocl, 0.25 m naoh). the eggs obtained were washed with m9 buffer (0.02 m kh2po4, 0.04 m na2hpo4, 0.08 m nacl, and 0.001mmgso4) andwere kept in plates containingm9without bacteria, during 14 h, until the larvae hatched in stage l1. chronic exposure of the l1 worms to the negative control (0.5% nacl) and the different formulations (zein nanoparticles, neem oilloaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil) was performed for 30 min with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/ml of the test material, using 1500 worms per replicate (per microtube), in a liquid medium (0.5% nacl), with stirring to ensure contact of the nematodes with the treatments. concentrations were tested in duplicates, in every experiment using c. elegans, a procedure that was repeated in three independent experiments (in different days and different batch of worms). after exposure, the worms were placed with the treatment on ngm plates with e. coli op50, and were kept at 20 °c for 48 h. thewild type strain nematodeswere evaluated in terms of their survival, reproduction, body size, and pharyngeal pumping. for gst-4 enzymatic expression, cl2166 strain that has gst-4 tagged to a gfp was used and the labeled xenobiotic detoxification protein was determined according to its fluorescence (rathor et al., 2017). for survival evaluation, 48 h after exposure a transparent grid was placed beneath the ngm plate and 18 quadrants were analyzed under a dissection microscope, obtaining a score according to the number of living animals. after scoring survival, reproduction was determined by counting the hatched larvae daily from three individual worms from each treatment transferred to ngmplate coveredwith e. coli op50, during 4 reproductive days. body size was evaluated by images acquired 48 h after the exposures, using an inverted microscope (medilux mdl-inv-1) connected to a digital camera (samsung st64). imagej software was used to measure the body lengths of 10 worms per group, in each experiment. pharyngeal pumping was counted for 1 min using 10 worms submitted to each treatment, in order to assess the intake of the treatments. individuals of the cl2166 transgenic strain were exposed to the different treatments (0.5% nacl as negative control, zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles and neem oil) and were then transferred to microscope slides containing levamisole (1 mm) as an anesthetic. images were acquired using an epifluorescence microscope (nikon eclipse 50i) with a gfp filter (with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 420 nm), and the fluorescence was measured using imagej software. 2.5. statistical analysis themolecular analysis of the effects of the nanoparticles on soil microbiota and c. elegans assayswere performed in duplicate, and all other experimentswere performed in triplicate, however, these replicates are considered one independent experiment and were repeated at least three times, and the data were expressed as average of three independent experiments±standard deviations, represented by error bars. statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism v. 6 software, using two-way anova followed by the tukey post-hoc test, at a significance level of p b 0.05. 3. results and discussion 3.1. physicochemical characterization of the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles in order to characterize the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles we have measured themean hydrodynamic diameters of the nanoparticles dispersed in water using dls and nta. the results obtained by dls and nta were 288 ± 6 and 198 ± 16 nm, respectively (fig. 2a). these results indicated that during the zein nanoparticles formation in presence the surfactant showed a range of size as described by other authors. wu et al. (2012), using zein nanoparticles containing thymol and carvacrol showed the mean size distribution by dls in a range of 52 to 328 nm. 60 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 in pursuance of size distribution, using atomic force microscopy (fig. 2b), the results showed that the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles were spherical, with amean diameter of 278±61 nm(with a concentration of nanoparticles/ml of 1.13 × 1012). using afm, chen et al. (2013) observed that zein nanoparticles were spherical, with sizes of around 100–200 nm. cheng et al. (2019) reported the same size for spherical zein nanoparticles containing lutein. oliveira et al. (2018) showed that zein nanoparticles containing geraniol and citronellal were spherical, with smooth surfaces and mean size of 90–250 nm. however, fig. 2a and b showed a broad size distribution curves, indicating that the particleswere notmonodisperse. this informationwas confirmed by the measurement of the polydispersity index. the value obtained for neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles was 0.313 ± 0.005. also, determined by nta, the span value calculated as described by bender et al. (2012) was 1.3 ± 0.005. based on both parameters a formulation is defined as monodisperse when the polydispersity index and span presented values lower than 0.2 and 1 respectively. however, in literaturewas described that nanoparticles preparedwith matrices of natural origin (such as zein) was not monodisperse (chuacharoen and sabliov, 2016; oliveira et al., 2018). also, in order to investigate the stability, we have been used themicroelectrophoresis technique tomeasure the zeta potential of neemoilloaded zein nanoparticles. the results showed that the zeta potential of this system was−36 ± 1 mv, which was close to the values characteristic of a stable formulation (±30mv). furthermore, in the case of these zein nanoparticles, during the preparation process we used pluronic f- 68 that provided steric hindrance, which was another factor that contributing to the stability of the zein nanoparticles in solution (chuacharoen and sabliov, 2016). just in order to compare, negative zeta potential values (determined by microelectrophoresis) have been reported previously for zein nanoparticles loaded with 5-fluorouracil (−45 ± 0.3 mv) (lai and guo, 2011), zein nanoparticles loaded with thymol (from −34 to −40 mv) (li et al., 2013), and zein nanoparticles stabilized with carrageenan (from −40 to −50 mv) (cheng and jones, 2017). moreover as we investigated the effect of the toxicity of these particles in models (such as c. elegans) that used salinemedium(0.5% nacl), the fig. 2c showed that theymaintained the samemean hydrodynamic size, polydispersity, and concentration during 120min (exposition time in c. elegans), while the zeta potential decreased significantly. the zeta potential was significantly lower in the saline environment, reaching −7.4 mv. this decreasing in zeta potential value in the presence of saline medium was reported in literature (de oliveira et al., 2015; grillo et al., 2014, 2012; jacques et al., 2017) and explained due the greater ionic strength of the saline medium altered the ionic balance, leading to changes in the nanoparticle surface charge. it is important to pointed out that even with the low values of zeta potential (−7.4 mv) the particles kept stable in solution, showing in thisway, the importance of the steric hindrance of pluronic f-68 in neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles. 3.2. toxicity studies 3.2.1. allium cepa chromosome aberration assay the results obtained in the a. cepa assay (fig. 3) showed significant differences between the control and all treatments, for both parameters evaluated (mitotic index and relative damage index). the treatments with pluronic, zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil decreased the relative mitotic index (fig. 3a). use of the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles resulted in a greater decrease in the mitotic index, compared to all other treatments. then, our results confirm the ability of the treatments to interfere in cell mitosis, as reported by kwankua et al. (2010) and pasquoto-stigliani et al. (2017), that showed that neem oil extract caused a significant decrease in the mitotic index of allium cepa roots. the decreases in the mitotic index caused by neem oil, together with the presence of chromosome alteration, c-metaphase (fig. 3b), could be attributed to the azadirachtin ability to interfere in mitosis usually a consequence of changes in the spindles, similar to that seen with colchicine treatment, which prevents the formation of spindle fibers, impairing the cell cycle progress (soliman, 2001). the results obtained for the relative damage index (fig. 3c) showed that the surfactant used in production of the zein nanocarriers caused fewer chromosomal changes, compared to the control. for the other treatments (zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil), the chromosomal changes were significantly increased. fig. 2. characterization and stability of the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles: a) mean hydrodynamic size distribution curves obtained using the dls and nta techniques applied to a suspension of the nanoparticles in water; b) micrograph and size distribution obtained using the afm technique in noncontact mode with tapal-g cantilevers and tip voltage of 90 hz. the image obtained was treated using gwyddion software; c) mean hydrodynamic size (lines) and concentration (bars) of the nanoparticles in saline medium (0.5% nacl), as a function of time. the spherical nanoparticles showed an average diameter of 278 ± 61.5 nm with no aggregates. the nanoparticles were stable over 120 min, under the experimental conditions. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) and the error bars represent the standard deviations. a significance level of p b 0.05 was adopted. m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 61 the zein nanoparticles and the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles caused increases of 25% in the damage index. however, it should be noted that neem oil alone (in the absence of nanoparticles) increased the number of chromosomal aberrations by 200%. a similar result was reported by kwankua et al. (2010) who found that neem oil caused a 400% increase in chromosomal aberrations in alliumcepa, that solidifies our findings that indicate the zein nanoparticles are promising carriers for neem oil, since they are able to decrease over the genotoxicity towards nontarget organisms. 3.2.2. effects of the nanoparticles on soil bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle soil microbiota are considered soil quality parameters once they are responsible for regulating several important soil processes such as organic matter decomposition, degradation of organic pollutants and transformation of nutrients (fang et al., 2019). the nitrogen (n) cycle consists of several n transformation processes which are performed by bacteria that have specific genes to encode enzymes involved in each stage of the cycle including nifh (encoding nitrogenase reductase, nitrogen-fixing enzyme: reduction of nitrogen gas in ammonia), amoa (encoding ammonia monooxygenase, nitrification enzyme: conversion of ammonia to hydroxylamine), hao (encoding hydroxylamine oxidase, nitrification enzyme: oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite) narg (encoding nitrate reductase, first two denitrification steps: reduction of nitrate to nitrite) nirk and nirs (encoding cu-containing nitrite reductase and nitrite reductase, respectively, first two denitrification steps: catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide), cnorb (encoding nitric oxide reductase, second two denitrification steps: reduces nitric oxide to nitrous oxide) and nosz (encoding nitrous oxide reductase; second two denitrification steps: reduction of nitrous oxide tomolecular nitrogen) (hirsch and mauchline, 2015; ouyang et al., 2018). in this context, soil analysis should be evaluated based on control sample that exists for each period evaluated. the percentages of nitrogen cycle genes (fig. 4b) show that after 7 days there is a small amount of bacteria that present the cnorb gene, but this also presents small amount in the control, indicating a homogeneity between the samples and the non-alteration of the genes compared to the control (possible observation in 5a and 5b, referring to 7 days after exposure). the results in timeof 14 days after exposure it is possible to observe the presence of bacteria that have the cnorb gene, being the proportions similar to those found in control soil. the concentration of bacteria (time 14 days) presents a greater variation in relation to the control, but the existing proportion of each type of bacteria responsible for the maintenance of the nitrogen cycle is similar between the treatments and the control. it is also possible to observe an increase the nifh gene, responsible for the nitrogen fixation, especially in control sample, and in other treatments this still remains with a low relative quantification. after 21 days the quantification shows that in relation to the number of genes that participate in the cycle the treatments are matched in a smaller quantity to control, it is possible to observe a decrease in the quantification of cnorb and a slight increase in the amount of nirs gene, responsible for the second step of denitrification. in the end experiment (after 30 days of exposure) the increase nosz and cnorb genes indicates an increase in final steps of the nitrogen cycle, being observed in all the samples evaluated, including in control. it was possible to observe greater homogeneity between the samples in relation to both the quantification and the distribution have great similarity indicating that the soil, in relation to the bacteria responsible for the nitrogen cycle do not seem to suffer changes in the presence of the evaluated compounds. in according to our results, pasquoto-stigliani et al. (2017) investigated the behavior of bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle when fig. 3. results of the allium cepa aberration assay: a) relative mitotic index values for the different treatments; b) presence of c-metaphases in the neem oil treatment; c) relative damage index of roots submitted to treatments for 24 h with pluronic f-68 surfactant (280 mg/ml), zein nanoparticles (np), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (neem np), and neem oil (neem), using neem oil concentrations of 5 mg/ml. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) and the error bars represent the standard deviations. letters a, b, c, and d indicate a significant difference relative to the control, pluronic, np, and neem np, respectively. the significance level adoptedwas p b 0.05. 62 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 exposed to poly(ε-caprolactone) nanocapsules loaded with neem and showed that the differences in the proportions of these bacteria, compared to the control, varied during the experiment, with no significant difference after 300 days. maruyama et al. (2016) evaluated atrazine and imazethapyr nanocapsules, showed lower effects on the bacterial profile associated with the nitrogen cycle, in the soil displayed in comparison with control. yang et al.

(2017) analyzed the effects of silver nanoparticles on nitrogen-fixing, nitrifying, and denitrifying bacteria, and found that the nitrifying bacteria were significantly affected, while the nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying organisms were not. the use ofmolecular analysis of the genes of soilmicrobiota involved in the nitrogen cycle to investigate the possible toxicity of new materials, especially nanoparticles, is still recent and the literature is very limited. further detailed studies are needed and are essential to ensure the safe use of newly emerging technologies. 3.2.3. effects of the formulations on the nematode c. elegans the results of toxicity assays performed with c. elegans (fig. 5) showed that the survival, reproduction, and body length of the worms did not present significant differences after exposure to the zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil (using neem oil concentrations of 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/ml). this lack of toxicity for a nontarget organism is very promising for the advance of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticle research. these endpoints have been validated as the basic triad for safety assessment. even if mortality rate does not increase following exposure to a toxicant, the reproductive system and the development of the worms are very sensitive and may show tenuous signs of cellular damage (tejeda-benitez and olivero- verbel, 2016). that because during the larval stages,mitosis andmeiosis are in fast speed and it has been demonstrated that toxicants, pesticides included, can disrupt cell cycle, elevate dna double-strand break formation, activate apoptosis and increase embryonic lethality (shin et al., 2019). of note, another study evaluating the toxicity of zein nanoparticles loaded with the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide (with an average size of 190 nm and a surface charge of −37 mv) and showed that the formulation exerted significant hypolipidemic activity in c. elegans, without causing any toxic effect (lucio et al., 2017). in contrast, nanoparticles toxicity can be detected in this animal model. jacques et al. fig. 4.molecular analysis of the genes of bacteria associatedwith the nitrogen cycle (nifh, nosz, cnorb, nirk, narg, andnirs). a) relative quantification of genes by qpcr and b) proportions of genes in the control soil and soils exposed to the zein nanoparticles (np), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (neem np), and neem oil (neem), at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after the initial treatment. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3). m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 63 (2017) have shown that differentnps interfered in the survival and vital parameters of c. elegans. solid lipid nanoparticles with or without atrazine and simazine (sizes of 293± 3 and 288 ± 6 nm, respectively) and polymeric nanoparticleswith orwithout atrazine (sizes of 367±13 and 305 ± 12 nm, respectively) depicted dose-dependent increases of lethality and decreases of c. elegans body length. chitosan/ tripolyphosphate nanoparticles, produced using a natural biopolymer, with or without paraquat (sizes of 262 ± 14 and 246 ± 7 nm, respectively), caused increased mortality, but did not alter reproduction or worm length in the surviving animals, therefore providing evidences that natural biopolymers can be more compatible to nontarget organisms (jacques et al., 2017). using another nontarget organism deng et al. (2013) and wang et al. (2013) investigated the subacute, acute, and subchronic toxicity of neem oil towards mice and the only significant result was after 90 days, when the mice treated with neem oil at a dose of 1600 mg/kg/day presented several degrees of lesions in the testes, liver, and kidneys. however, the lesions were decreased or eliminated after a 30-day recovery period not demonstrating critical toxicity to the organism studied, in the same way that it happened in our research (wang et al., 2013). in the presentwork, the pharyngeal pumping of theworms (fig. 5d) decreased significantly in the treatments with neem oil at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.75 mg/ml, compared to the control group, while the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles caused no significant alterations in the worms. pharyngeal pumping is an indicator of a healthy worm and is mainly controlled by cholinergic and glutamatergic innervation, aswell as by dopamine and serotonin (raizen, 2012). reduced pharyngeal pumping can lead to dietary restriction (powolny et al., 2011). the results suggested that the zein nanoparticle formulationwas able to decrease the toxicity of neem oil in this organism. these findings were in agreementwith thework of sanchesmoraes et al. (2016)who reported the ability of polymeric nanocapsules to decrease the toxic effects of clozapine in c. elegans. as shown in fig. 5e, the treatments with neem oil at all concentrations caused significant decreases in fluorescence intensity, indicating reduced gst-4 expression, compared to the untreated animals. the zein nanoparticles and neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles did not affect thegst-4 enzyme levels. gst-4 is involved in cellular detoxification and cell defense, so the reduction induced by neem oil could lead to oxidative stress and cell death (lindblom and dodd, 2006). the results showed that the neem oil decreased gst-4 levels in c. elegans by up to 66%, compared to the control, representing a threat since this protein is regulated by protective transcription factors, promoting longevity and resistance to stress (rathor et al., 2015). it should be highlighted that the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles did not affect this parameter, providing further evidence that the new zein nanoparticle system was capable of reducing toxicity towards nontarget organisms (fig. 6). in previous studies, it has been found that treatments using extracts of lavandula latifolia, melissa officinalis, origanum vulgare (gayoso et al., 2018), ginkgo biloba (kampkotter et al., 2007) and antioxidant compounds such as quercetin (büchter et al., 2015) led to reduced gst-4 expression. it should be noted that the antioxidant capacity of pure neem oil has been demonstrated in several previous studies (mattos et al., 2017; rinaldi et al., 2017; sithisarn et al., 2005). fig. 5. toxicity assay using c. elegans exposed for 48 h to 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75mg/ml of zein nanoparticles (np), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (neem np), and neem oil (neem). the wild type strain was evaluated for a) survival rate, b) brood size, c) body length, and d) pharyngeal pumping. the transgenic cl2166 strain was evaluated for e) fluorescence intensity, which indicates levels of gst-4 expression. the neem oil caused decreases in pharyngeal pumping and gst-4 expression. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) normalized to % and the error bars represent the standard deviation. letters a, b, and c indicate a significant difference relative to the control, np, and neem np, respectively. a significance level of p b 0.05 was considered. 64 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 4. conclusions the neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles developed in this work presented good colloidal characteristics and stability in different media. in the a. cepa analysis, the use of zein nanoparticles decreased the relative damage index caused by neem oil. in relation to the microbiota of the soil nitrogen cycle, the response to the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticleswas similar to that observed for control. in tests using c. elegans, the organism was susceptible to the effects of neem oil, while the nanoparticles did not show potential toxicity. in this way, more studies must be carried out to guarantee the effects of this nanopesticide before its application in agriculture. it is therefore extremely important to recognize its mechanisms of action (for both, nanopesticides and neem), as well as their possible effects at the cellular level, their efficacy and their toxicity to target organisms. a final consideration is that the definition of the risks associated with nanobiopesticides requires amultidisciplinary approach and that, in order to be sustainable and safe, it is crucial to ensure the awareness and use of correct management practices between farmers and the wider population. abbreviations gst-4 glutathione s-transferase 4 cl2166 transgenic fluorescence c. elegans type afm atomic

chellappandian et al., 2018). essential oils can be extracted from the whole plant or from isolated parts in order to obtain higher concentrations of a specific compound. since antiquity, essential oils have been used due to their repellent, insecticidal, fungicidal, nematicidal, and bactericidal activities. they are considered safer than synthetic pesticides, having been used for human consumption and as medicines for thousands of years. they might be less toxic to nontarget organisms, such as humans, and have low impacts in the environment. therefore, essential oils are a promising option for substituting the synthetic pesticides used in agriculture (benelli and pavela, 2018; de oliveira et al., 2018a, 2018b; ponsankar et al., 2016). neem oil, which is extracted from the indian neem tree (azadirachta indica juss.), is valued worldwide for use in the areas of human health and pest control (lokanadhan et al., n.d.). neem oil contains n300 biologically active compounds, with the major constituents being triterpenes known as limonoids (fig. 1), the most important of which is azadirachtin (chandramohan et al., 2016; gupta et al., 2017; nicoletti et al., 2012). neem oil is effective against a wide range of pests, exhibiting a broad spectrum of action due to its systemic and transmembrane activities. it inhibits feeding, reduces ecdysone,motion, and flight activity, deregulates development, suppresses fertility and reproduction, and acts as a repellent (campos et al., 2016). in addition, neemoil can act as a fertilizer, improving the quality of soil for crop production, hence contributing to sustainable organic agriculture. however, its use in the field is limited by its short persistence in the environment (kumar et al., 2018; shah et al., 2017). the application of nanotechnology in agriculture emphasizes the goal of the development of clean, safe, and environmentally friendly nanomaterials, using biocompatible and nontoxic solvents, biodegradable and biocompatible natural matrices, and energy-efficient and sustainable processes (ashoka et al., 2017; bai et al., 2018; saratale et al., 2018). nanocarriers are capable of increasing the solubility of active compounds, while protecting them from volatilization and from degradation. the improvements in efficiency can generate better results, using lower doses and numbers of applications, hence contributing to the reduction of both environmental contamination and risks to human health (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; choudhary et al., 2017; oliveira et al., 2018). different types of nanoparticle formulations are fig. 1. chemical structures of the main active compounds of neem oil. 58 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 used in agriculture as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, fertilizers, and growth regulators, among others (pascoli et al., 2018b). the use of polymeric nanoparticles as sustained release systems in agriculture has shown excellent results, due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; de oliveira et al., 2018a; de oliveira et al., 2018b; oliveira et al., 2018). several studies have demonstrated the potential of formulations of biopesticides associated with polymeric nanoparticles (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; de oliveira et al., 2018a; de oliveira et al., 2018b; maruyama et al., 2016; oliveira et al., 2018; pascoli et al., 2018a, 2018b). zein nanoparticles meet the requirements of environmentally friendly nanotechnology, since zein is a naturally product that is biodegradable and biocompatible. it represents the main protein content of corn, is composed of lipophilic amino acid residues, and is not used for direct human consumption, due to its negative nitrogen balance and low water solubility (paliwal and palakurthi, 2014). due to its high coating capacity, zein is used in the production of nanocarrier systems, employing a low toxicity solvent, such as ethanol, which is evaporated during the synthesis, hence causing no harm to the environment when the formulation is used in the field. nanoparticles are capable of modifying the properties of the active substances that encapsulated, so, it is necessary to re-screen the material in order to ensure its safe use. this involves assays using target and nontarget organisms, as well as evaluation of the behaviors of newformulations in the environment, aiming at regulation of the use of biopesticides associatedwith nanomaterials in crop protection (campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; dere et al., 2015; fraceto et al., 2016; pascoli et al., 2018a, 2018b; sola et al., 2014). given this background, the innovation of this study was to develop neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles. in addition to preparation and characterization of the nanocarriers, using the novel safe by design strategy their potential toxicity was evaluated by investigating their effects on nontarget organisms (allium cepa, nitrogen cycle bacteria, and caenorhabditis elegans). the choice was because they are model organisms, all are used in the research of toxicity of materialsmaking possible a broad investigation of the possible action of zein nanoparticles loaded with neem oil, since they are in different classes of organisms (plant, nematodes and microorganisms) that can come into contact with this new biopesticide in the crops. the work opens perspectives for the use of nanobiopesticides based on neem oil in crop protection, contributing to sustainable organic agriculture aswell as improved food safety. 2. materials andmethods 2.1. materials zein and pluronic f-68 were purchased from sigma-aldrich. neem oil (azamax) containing 12 g/ml of azadirachtin was acquired from upl brazil. ethanol was obtained from labsynth. allium cepa seeds were purchased from isla seeds (brazilian company). the soil used was obtained from a local agricultural supplier. c. elegans n2 (wild type) and cl2166 (dvis19 [(gst-4p::gfp::nls] iii) strainswere purchased from the caenorhabitis genetics center, minnesota, usa. other chemicals and solvents used were analytical grade and were purchased from local suppliers. 2.2. preparation of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles zein nanoparticles were prepared by the environmentally-friendly antisolvent precipitation method (hu and mcclements, 2014) with some modifications (pascoli et al., 2018a). the antisolvent method is a principlewhere the active compound is dissolved in a solvent; the solution is then injected with an antisolvent solution (in which the compound is insoluble). the compound precipitates as a consequence of the change of supersaturation caused by mixing the solution and the antisolvent solution. in this way, zein powder (2% w/v) was added to an aqueous solution of ethanol (85% v/v) and kept under magnetic stirring overnight. the zein solution was adjusted to ph 5.8, heattreated at 75 °c for 15 min for protein densification, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane (millipore) to remove insoluble particles. a 100 mg quantity of neem oil (in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate containing 12 g/l of azadirachtin)was added to the zein solution. an aqueous solution of pluronic f-68 (a block-copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (c3h6o·c2h4o)x) extensively used as surfactant, wetting agents and emulsifiers) (2% v/v) was prepared and was adjusted to ph 4. the presence of pluronic f-68 decreased the surface tension of the nanoparticles andmaintains the stability of the nanoparticles in suspension. using a syringe, the zein solution was rapidly injected into the pluronic solution, under stirring. the resulting colloidal dispersion was stirred for 12 h, at roomtemperature, in order to evaporate the ethanol, and water (ph 4.0) was then added to make up the original volume. the final concentration of neem oil in the nanoformulation was 5 mg/ml. this concentrationwas chosen since in agriculture, neemoil is used at concentrations of between 4 and 6mg/ml as recommended by the manufacturer upl brazil. 2.3. nanoparticle physicochemical characterization the nanoparticle mean size distribution and polydispersity index (an indicator of the homo/heterogeneity of the size distribution of particles calculated by the square of the standard deviation divided by the square of themean size)were determined by the dynamic light scattering technique (dls). the zeta potentialwasmeasured by the microelectrophoresis method. these analyses were performed using a zetasizer nano zs90 system (malvern instruments, uk) at a fixed angle of 90° and 25 °c. the nanoparticle concentrations, size distributions, and span values (an additional parameter to show thewidth of the size distribution calculated as span=(d90−d10) /d50 being that d10, d50 and d90 refer, respectively, to the diameters where 10%, 50% and 90% of the particle population were also measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (nta), using a nanosight lm 10 cell (green laserwithwavelength of 532 nm) and a scmos camera, controlled by nanosight v. 3.2 software (grillo et al., 2012, 2014). for these analyses, the samples were diluted 1000× in ultrapure water and in liquid medium (0.5% saline solution), at the highest concentration used in the c. elegans assay. stability analyses were performed using sample aliquots removed after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 min of incubation in the saline solution. each result was expressed as the average of three determinations. aliquots of zein nanoparticles and neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles were collected and diluted in ultrapure water. samples were dripped onto a silicon plate afm sampler and kept in a desiccator for complete drying. the samples were analyzed using an easy scan 2 basic bt02217 atomic force microscope (nanosurf, switzerland) operated in noncontact mode with tapal-g cantilevers (budgetsensors, bulgaria) and tip voltage of 90 hz. the acquired images were analyzed using gwyddion software. 2.4. toxicity studies 2.4.1. allium cepa assay based on the procedure described by de lima et al. (2010) germinated a. cepa seeds were exposed to the nanoformulations (zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles), neem oil (at a concentration of 5 mg/ml), pluronic f-68 surfactant, and ultrapure water (negative control) in 10 ml glass beaker, in dark conditions for periods of 24 h. 10 roots were exposed to each treatment. the roots were fixed in carnoy's reagent (methanol:acetic acid, 3:1 v/v), followed by acid hydrolysis with 1 mol/l hcl at 60 °c during 9 min. the roots were stained with schiff reagent for 2 h. for preparation of the slides, the meristematic region was crushed in one drop of 2% aceticcarmine, using a cover slip. three roots exposed for each treatment were used to prepare the slides and all the cells were analyzed. this m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 59 assay was repeated three independent times in different days. calculations were made of the mitotic index (mi), the damage index (di), and the relative index (ri) which are indicators of the presence of cytotoxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential agents in the environment. mi was calculated by dividing the number of cells in division by the total number of cells. di was calculated by dividing the number of cells showing dna alterations during the mitosis by the total number of cells in division. ri was calculated by dividing the values obtained for the treatments by the values for the negative control. 2.4.2. molecular analysis of the effects of the nanoparticles on soil microbiota we investigated the changes in all genes from the n cycle due the importance of this cycle for the nitrogen fixation in soil making the soil fertile by converting nitrogen into bioavailable forms that can be assimilated by living beings for production of organic molecules such as amino acids proteins and nucleic acids. therefore, the quantification of these functional genes involved in n transformation performed in this work improves our understanding of n-cycling soil microbiota responses to environmental impact (hirsch and mauchline, 2015; fang et al., 2019). before use, the fertilized commercial soil (14% organic matter, ph 6.80) was sieved using a 0.2 micrometer sieve, dried and separated into vessels with surface area of 0.025 m2 each, and kept moist in a heated cabinet at 25 °c for 15 days. two untreated soil samples were used as the negative control. each treatment (zein nanoparticles, neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neemoil)were tested in duplicates (two vessels containing soil for each treatment). the applications of the formulations (using sprays) were based on the dosage and number of applications of neemoil employed in the field (three applications were performed on the samesample at 7-day intervals, using a 5mg/ml solution at a dosage of 100 l/ha). the extraction of dna from soil microorganisms was performed 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after the first application of the treatments, using a power soil dna isolation kit (mobio laboratories). quantification of the genetic material was performed by fluorescence, using a qubit 3.0 fluorometer with the qubit dsdna br assay kit (invitrogen). all the samples were diluted to final concentrations of 1000 ng/ml. real-time polymerase chain reactions (qpcr) were performed for specific genes from nitrogen cycle bacteria: nifh (nitrogen fixation), nirk, nirs, narg, cnorb, and nosz (denitrification). the bacterial 16s rna gene was used as a reference. the reactions were performed using 1 μl of dna sample, 12.5 μl of planium sybr green qpcr supermix-udg with rox (invitrogen), 1 μl of each primer (sense and antisense), and sufficient ultrapure water to complete the final volume to 25 μl. the amplifications were conducted according to a procedure adapted from jung et al. (2011) using a stepone thermocycler (applied biosystems),with an initial denaturation at 95 °c for 3min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 45 s, 60 °c for 45 s, and 72 °c for 45 s. the sybr green fluorescence emittedwas measured at the end of each incubation at 72 °c. the resultswere analyzed using relative quantification,with calculation of δδct (2−δδct), employing 16s rrna as the reference gene and the initial soil as the reference sample (yuan et al., 2008). the calculations were performed using the stepone plus v2. 3 software of the equipment. 2.4.3. caenorhabditis elegans assays c. elegans trains n2 (wild type, established as valuable experimental model due to the high level of genetic homology with humans, fast life cycle, easymaintenance and handling) and cl2166 (genetically equal to wildtype and tagged to green fluorescent protein, gfp, fused to the promoter of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-s-transferase-4) were maintained in plates containing ngm (nematode growth media) enriched with salts and seeded with the bacterium e. coli op50, at 20 °c. the fertilized nematodes were synchronized by lysing them with a bleaching mixture (1% naocl, 0.25 m naoh). the eggs obtained were washed with m9 buffer (0.02 m kh2po4, 0.04 m na2hpo4, 0.08 m nacl, and 0.001mmgso4) andwere kept in plates containingm9without bacteria, during 14 h, until the larvae hatched in stage l1. chronic exposure of the l1 worms to the negative control (0.5% nacl) and the different formulations (zein nanoparticles, neem oilloaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil) was performed for 30 min with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/ml of the test material, using 1500 worms per replicate (per microtube), in a liquid medium (0.5% nacl), with stirring to ensure contact of the nematodes with the treatments. concentrations were tested in duplicates, in every experiment using c. elegans, a procedure that was repeated in three independent experiments (in different days and different batch of worms). after exposure, the worms were placed with the treatment on ngm plates with e. coli op50, and were kept at 20 °c for 48 h. thewild type strain nematodeswere evaluated in terms of their survival, reproduction, body size, and pharyngeal pumping. for gst-4 enzymatic expression, cl2166 strain that has gst-4 tagged to a gfp was used and the labeled xenobiotic detoxification protein was determined according to its fluorescence (rathor et al., 2017). for survival evaluation, 48 h after exposure a transparent grid was placed beneath the ngm plate and 18 quadrants were analyzed under a dissection microscope, obtaining a score according to the number of living animals. after scoring survival, reproduction was determined by counting the hatched larvae daily from three individual worms from each treatment transferred to ngmplate coveredwith e. coli op50, during 4 reproductive days. body size was evaluated by images acquired 48 h after the exposures, using an inverted microscope (medilux mdl-inv-1) connected to a digital camera (samsung st64). imagej software was used to measure the body lengths of 10 worms per group, in each experiment. pharyngeal pumping was counted for 1 min using 10 worms submitted to each treatment, in order to assess the intake of the treatments. individuals of the cl2166 transgenic strain were exposed to the different treatments (0.5% nacl as negative control, zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles and neem oil) and were then transferred to microscope slides containing levamisole (1 mm) as an anesthetic. images were acquired using an epifluorescence microscope (nikon eclipse 50i) with a gfp filter (with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 420 nm), and the fluorescence was measured using imagej software. 2.5. statistical analysis themolecular analysis of the effects of the nanoparticles on soil microbiota and c. elegans assayswere performed in duplicate, and all other experimentswere performed in triplicate, however, these replicates are considered one independent experiment and were repeated at least three times, and the data were expressed as average of three independent experiments±standard deviations, represented by error bars. statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism v. 6 software, using two-way anova followed by the tukey post-hoc test, at a significance level of p b 0.05. 3. results and discussion 3.1. physicochemical characterization of the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles in order to characterize the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles we have measured themean hydrodynamic diameters of the nanoparticles dispersed in water using dls and nta. the results obtained by dls and nta were 288 ± 6 and 198 ± 16 nm, respectively (fig. 2a). these results indicated that during the zein nanoparticles formation in presence the surfactant showed a range of size as described by other authors. wu et al. (2012), using zein nanoparticles containing thymol and carvacrol showed the mean size distribution by dls in a range of 52 to 328 nm. 60 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 in pursuance of size distribution, using atomic force microscopy (fig. 2b), the results showed that the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles were spherical, with amean diameter of 278±61 nm(with a concentration of nanoparticles/ml of 1.13 × 1012). using afm, chen et al. (2013) observed that zein nanoparticles were spherical, with sizes of around 100–200 nm. cheng et al. (2019) reported the same size for spherical zein nanoparticles containing lutein. oliveira et al. (2018) showed that zein nanoparticles containing geraniol and citronellal were spherical, with smooth surfaces and mean size of 90–250 nm. however, fig. 2a and b showed a broad size distribution curves, indicating that the particleswere notmonodisperse. this informationwas confirmed by the measurement of the polydispersity index. the value obtained for neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles was 0.313 ± 0.005. also, determined by nta, the span value calculated as described by bender et al. (2012) was 1.3 ± 0.005. based on both parameters a formulation is defined as monodisperse when the polydispersity index and span presented values lower than 0.2 and 1 respectively. however, in literaturewas described that nanoparticles preparedwith matrices of natural origin (such as zein) was not monodisperse (chuacharoen and sabliov, 2016; oliveira et al., 2018). also, in order to investigate the stability, we have been used themicroelectrophoresis technique tomeasure the zeta potential of neemoilloaded zein nanoparticles. the results showed that the zeta potential of this system was−36 ± 1 mv, which was close to the values characteristic of a stable formulation (±30mv). furthermore, in the case of these zein nanoparticles, during the preparation process we used pluronic f- 68 that provided steric hindrance, which was another factor that contributing to the stability of the zein nanoparticles in solution (chuacharoen and sabliov, 2016). just in order to compare, negative zeta potential values (determined by microelectrophoresis) have been reported previously for zein nanoparticles loaded with 5-fluorouracil (−45 ± 0.3 mv) (lai and guo, 2011), zein nanoparticles loaded with thymol (from −34 to −40 mv) (li et al., 2013), and zein nanoparticles stabilized with carrageenan (from −40 to −50 mv) (cheng and jones, 2017). moreover as we investigated the effect of the toxicity of these particles in models (such as c. elegans) that used salinemedium(0.5% nacl), the fig. 2c showed that theymaintained the samemean hydrodynamic size, polydispersity, and concentration during 120min (exposition time in c. elegans), while the zeta potential decreased significantly. the zeta potential was significantly lower in the saline environment, reaching −7.4 mv. this decreasing in zeta potential value in the presence of saline medium was reported in literature (de oliveira et al., 2015; grillo et al., 2014, 2012; jacques et al., 2017) and explained due the greater ionic strength of the saline medium altered the ionic balance, leading to changes in the nanoparticle surface charge. it is important to pointed out that even with the low values of zeta potential (−7.4 mv) the particles kept stable in solution, showing in thisway, the importance of the steric hindrance of pluronic f-68 in neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles. 3.2. toxicity studies 3.2.1. allium cepa chromosome aberration assay the results obtained in the a. cepa assay (fig. 3) showed significant differences between the control and all treatments, for both parameters evaluated (mitotic index and relative damage index). the treatments with pluronic, zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil decreased the relative mitotic index (fig. 3a). use of the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles resulted in a greater decrease in the mitotic index, compared to all other treatments. then, our results confirm the ability of the treatments to interfere in cell mitosis, as reported by kwankua et al. (2010) and pasquoto-stigliani et al. (2017), that showed that neem oil extract caused a significant decrease in the mitotic index of allium cepa roots. the decreases in the mitotic index caused by neem oil, together with the presence of chromosome alteration, c-metaphase (fig. 3b), could be attributed to the azadirachtin ability to interfere in mitosis usually a consequence of changes in the spindles, similar to that seen with colchicine treatment, which prevents the formation of spindle fibers, impairing the cell cycle progress (soliman, 2001). the results obtained for the relative damage index (fig. 3c) showed that the surfactant used in production of the zein nanocarriers caused fewer chromosomal changes, compared to the control. for the other treatments (zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil), the chromosomal changes were significantly increased. fig. 2. characterization and stability of the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles: a) mean hydrodynamic size distribution curves obtained using the dls and nta techniques applied to a suspension of the nanoparticles in water; b) micrograph and size distribution obtained using the afm technique in noncontact mode with tapal-g cantilevers and tip voltage of 90 hz. the image obtained was treated using gwyddion software; c) mean hydrodynamic size (lines) and concentration (bars) of the nanoparticles in saline medium (0.5% nacl), as a function of time. the spherical nanoparticles showed an average diameter of 278 ± 61.5 nm with no aggregates. the nanoparticles were stable over 120 min, under the experimental conditions. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) and the error bars represent the standard deviations. a significance level of p b 0.05 was adopted. m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 61 the zein nanoparticles and the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles caused increases of 25% in the damage index. however, it should be noted that neem oil alone (in the absence of nanoparticles) increased the number of chromosomal aberrations by 200%. a similar result was reported by kwankua et al. (2010) who found that neem oil caused a 400% increase in chromosomal aberrations in alliumcepa, that solidifies our findings that indicate the zein nanoparticles are promising carriers for neem oil, since they are able to decrease over the genotoxicity towards nontarget organisms. 3.2.2. effects of the nanoparticles on soil bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle soil microbiota are considered soil quality parameters once they are responsible for regulating several important soil processes such as organic matter decomposition, degradation of organic pollutants and transformation of nutrients (fang et al., 2019). the nitrogen (n) cycle consists of several n transformation processes which are performed by bacteria that have specific genes to encode enzymes involved in each stage of the cycle including nifh (encoding nitrogenase reductase, nitrogen-fixing enzyme: reduction of nitrogen gas in ammonia), amoa (encoding ammonia monooxygenase, nitrification enzyme: conversion of ammonia to hydroxylamine), hao (encoding hydroxylamine oxidase, nitrification enzyme: oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite) narg (encoding nitrate reductase, first two denitrification steps: reduction of nitrate to nitrite) nirk and nirs (encoding cu-containing nitrite reductase and nitrite reductase, respectively, first two denitrification steps: catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide), cnorb (encoding nitric oxide reductase, second two denitrification steps: reduces nitric oxide to nitrous oxide) and nosz (encoding nitrous oxide reductase; second two denitrification steps: reduction of nitrous oxide tomolecular nitrogen) (hirsch and mauchline, 2015; ouyang et al., 2018). in this context, soil analysis should be evaluated based on control sample that exists for each period evaluated. the percentages of nitrogen cycle genes (fig. 4b) show that after 7 days there is a small amount of bacteria that present the cnorb gene, but this also presents small amount in the control, indicating a homogeneity between the samples and the non-alteration of the genes compared to the control (possible observation in 5a and 5b, referring to 7 days after exposure). the results in timeof 14 days after exposure it is possible to observe the presence of bacteria that have the cnorb gene, being the proportions similar to those found in control soil. the concentration of bacteria (time 14 days) presents a greater variation in relation to the control, but the existing proportion of each type of bacteria responsible for the maintenance of the nitrogen cycle is similar between the treatments and the control. it is also possible to observe an increase the nifh gene, responsible for the nitrogen fixation, especially in control sample, and in other treatments this still remains with a low relative quantification. after 21 days the quantification shows that in relation to the number of genes that participate in the cycle the treatments are matched in a smaller quantity to control, it is possible to observe a decrease in the quantification of cnorb and a slight increase in the amount of nirs gene, responsible for the second step of denitrification. in the end experiment (after 30 days of exposure) the increase nosz and cnorb genes indicates an increase in final steps of the nitrogen cycle, being observed in all the samples evaluated, including in control. it was possible to observe greater homogeneity between the samples in relation to both the quantification and the distribution have great similarity indicating that the soil, in relation to the bacteria responsible for the nitrogen cycle do not seem to suffer changes in the presence of the evaluated compounds. in according to our results, pasquoto-stigliani et al. (2017) investigated the behavior of bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle when fig. 3. results of the allium cepa aberration assay: a) relative mitotic index values for the different treatments; b) presence of c-metaphases in the neem oil treatment; c) relative damage index of roots submitted to treatments for 24 h with pluronic f-68 surfactant (280 mg/ml), zein nanoparticles (np), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (neem np), and neem oil (neem), using neem oil concentrations of 5 mg/ml. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) and the error bars represent the standard deviations. letters a, b, c, and d indicate a significant difference relative to the control, pluronic, np, and neem np, respectively. the significance level adoptedwas p b 0.05. 62 m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 exposed to poly(ε-caprolactone) nanocapsules loaded with neem and showed that the differences in the proportions of these bacteria, compared to the control, varied during the experiment, with no significant difference after 300 days. maruyama et al. (2016) evaluated atrazine and imazethapyr nanocapsules, showed lower effects on the bacterial profile associated with the nitrogen cycle, in the soil displayed in comparison with control. yang et al. (2013) and guilger et al. (2017) analyzed the effects of silver nanoparticles on nitrogen-fixing, nitrifying, and denitrifying bacteria, and found that the nitrifying bacteria were significantly affected, while the nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying organisms were not. the use ofmolecular analysis of the genes of soilmicrobiota involved in the nitrogen cycle to investigate the possible toxicity of new materials, especially nanoparticles, is still recent and the literature is very limited. further detailed studies are needed and are essential to ensure the safe use of newly emerging technologies. 3.2.3. effects of the formulations on the nematode c. elegans the results of toxicity assays performed with c. elegans (fig. 5) showed that the survival, reproduction, and body length of the worms did not present significant differences after exposure to the zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil (using neem oil concentrations of 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/ml). this lack of toxicity for a nontarget organism is very promising for the advance of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticle research. these endpoints have been validated as the basic triad for safety assessment. even if mortality rate does not increase following exposure to a toxicant, the reproductive system and the development of the worms are very sensitive and may show tenuous signs of cellular damage (tejeda-benitez and olivero- verbel, 2016). that because during the larval stages,mitosis andmeiosis are in fast speed and it has been demonstrated that toxicants, pesticides included, can disrupt cell cycle, elevate dna double-strand break formation, activate apoptosis and increase embryonic lethality (shin et al., 2019). of note, another study evaluating the toxicity of zein nanoparticles loaded with the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide (with an average size of 190 nm and a surface charge of −37 mv) and showed that the formulation exerted significant hypolipidemic activity in c. elegans, without causing any toxic effect (lucio et al., 2017). in contrast, nanoparticles toxicity can be detected in this animal model. jacques et al. fig. 4.molecular analysis of the genes of bacteria associatedwith the nitrogen cycle (nifh, nosz, cnorb, nirk, narg, andnirs). a) relative quantification of genes by qpcr and b) proportions of genes in the control soil and soils exposed to the zein nanoparticles (np), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (neem np), and neem oil (neem), at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after the initial treatment. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3). m. pascoli et al. / science of the total environment 677 (2019) 57–67 63 (2017) have shown that differentnps interfered in the survival and vital parameters of c. elegans. solid lipid nanoparticles with or without atrazine and simazine (sizes of 293± 3 and 288 ± 6 nm, respectively) and polymeric nanoparticleswith orwithout atrazine (sizes of 367±13 and 305 ± 12 nm, respectively) depicted dose-dependent increases of lethality and decreases of c. elegans body length. chitosan/ tripolyphosphate nanoparticles, produced using a natural biopolymer, with or without paraquat (sizes of 262 ± 14 and 246 ± 7 nm, respectively), caused increased mortality, but did not alter reproduction or worm length in the surviving animals, therefore providing evidences that natural biopolymers can be more compatible to nontarget organisms (jacques et al., 2017). using another nontarget organism deng et al. (2013) and wang et al. (2013) investigated the subacute, acute, and subchronic toxicity of neem oil towards mice and the only significant result was after 90 days, when the mice treated with neem oil at a dose of 1600 mg/kg/day presented several degrees of lesions in the testes, liver, and kidneys. however, the lesions were decreased or eliminated after a 30-day recovery period not demonstrating critical toxicity to the organism studied, in the same way that it happened in our research (wang et al., 2013). in the presentwork, the pharyngeal pumping of theworms (fig. 5d) decreased significantly in the treatments with neem oil at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.75 mg/ml, compared to the control group, while the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles caused no significant alterations in the worms. pharyngeal pumping is an indicator of a healthy worm and is mainly controlled by cholinergic and glutamatergic innervation, aswell as by dopamine and serotonin (raizen, 2012). reduced pharyngeal pumping can lead to dietary restriction (powolny et al., 2011). the results suggested that the zein nanoparticle formulationwas able to decrease the toxicity of neem oil in this organism. these findings were in agreementwith thework of sanchesmoraes et al. (2016)who reported the ability of polymeric nanocapsules to decrease the toxic effects of clozapine in c. elegans. as shown in fig. 5e, the treatments with neem oil at all concentrations caused significant decreases in fluorescence intensity, indicating reduced gst-4 expression, compared to the untreated animals. the zein nanoparticles and neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles did not affect thegst-4 enzyme levels. gst-4 is involved in cellular detoxification and cell defense, so the reduction induced by neem oil could lead to oxidative stress and cell death (lindblom and dodd, 2006). the results showed that the neem oil decreased gst-4 levels in c. elegans by up to 66%, compared to the control, representing a threat since this protein is regulated by protective transcription factors, promoting longevity and resistance to stress (rathor et al., 2015). it should be highlighted that the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles did not affect this parameter, providing further evidence that the new zein nanoparticle system was capable of reducing toxicity towards nontarget organisms (fig. 6). in previous studies, it has been found that treatments using extracts of lavandula latifolia, melissa officinalis, origanum vulgare (gayoso et al., 2018), ginkgo biloba (kampkotter et al., 2007) and antioxidant compounds such as quercetin (büchter et al., 2015) led to reduced gst-4 expression. it should be noted that the antioxidant capacity of pure neem oil has been demonstrated in several previous studies (mattos et al., 2017; rinaldi et al., 2017; sithisarn et al., 2005). fig. 5. toxicity assay using c. elegans exposed for 48 h to 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75mg/ml of zein nanoparticles (np), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (neem np), and neem oil (neem). the wild type strain was evaluated for a) survival rate, b) brood size, c) body length, and d) pharyngeal pumping. the transgenic cl2166 strain was evaluated for e) fluorescence intensity, which indicates levels of gst-4 expression. the neem oil caused decreases in pharyngeal pumping and gst-4 expression. data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) normalized to % and the error bars represent the standard deviation. letters a, b, and c indicate a significant difference relative to the control, np, and neem np, respectively. a significance level of p b 0.05 was considered. 64 m.

different media. in the a. cepa analysis, the use of zein nanoparticles decreased the relative damage index caused by neem oil. in relation to the microbiota of the soil nitrogen cycle, the response to the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticleswas similar to that observed for control. in tests using c. elegans, the organism was susceptible to the effects of neem oil, while the nanoparticles did not show potential toxicity. in this way, more studies must be carried out to guarantee the effects of this nanopesticide before its application in agriculture. it is therefore extremely important to recognize its mechanisms of action (for both, nanopesticides and neem), as well as their possible effects at the cellular level, their efficacy and their toxicity to target organisms. a final consideration is that the definition of the risks associated with nanobiopesticides requires amultidisciplinary approach and that, in order to be sustainable and safe, it is crucial to ensure the awareness and use of correct management practices between farmers and the wider population. abbreviations gst-4 glutathione s-transferase 4 cl2166 transgenic fluorescence c. elegans type afm atomic
