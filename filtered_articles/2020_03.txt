reindl and sheridan, 2012). indeed, mammalian and salmonid data are in agreement on all key aspects of the gh/igf-i axis (bjornsson, 1997; bjornsson et al., 2018). the gh receptor is found in most tissues, with the highest density located in the liver (bjornsson et al., 2002; reindl and sheridan, 2012). gh can thus stimulate tissue growth directly, but also does so indirectly through gh-induced production and release of igf-i from the liver (daughaday and rotwein, 1989). in mammals and fishes alike, igf-i acts via autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanisms to mediate the growth promoting actions of gh as well as acting as a negative feedback signal on gh secretion from the pituitary (duan, 1998; perez- sanchez and le bail, 1999; perez-sanchez et al., 1992; tannenbaum, 1993; wood et al., 2005). the effects of both local and circulating igf-i are modulated by a complex suite of igf binding proteins (igfbps) (duan and xu, 2005; shimizu and dickhoff, 2017). it is not surprising then, that nutritional status is the primary environmental regulator of the gh/igf-i axis – that is, growth must adjust according to nutritional conditions and, as the primary regulator of growth, this means that nutritional state will affect the gh/igf-i axis (duan, 1998; moriyama et al., 2000; pierce et al., 2001; thissen et al., 1999). during fasting, growth ceases, and energy is mobilized from storage tissues to support metabolism and maintain homeostasis (bar, 2014; navarro and gutierrez, 1995). these effects are mediated in part by changes in the gh/igf-i axis. fasting normally leads to increased plasma gh levels while igf-i levels decrease, an endocrine condition known as acquired gh resistance (jenkins and ross, 1996; thissen et al., 1994; thissen et al., 1999). in fasted fish, changes in gh/igf-i axis hormones are part of an adaptive response; low igf-i suppresses growth and high gh stimulates lipolysis, thereby directing available nutrients to the physiological functions necessary for survival while also gaining access to energy reserves. this response is important in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2020.110751 received 8 may 2020;

mommsen, 2004; navarro and gutierrez, 1995). thus, plasma gh and igf-i levels can be used as indicators of nutritional status. the gh/igf-i axis interacts with other physiological systems, particularly those that regulate life history transitions. in salmonids, gh and igf-i increase during smoltification, the suite of physiological, morphological, and behavioral changes that occur before migration to saltwater (mccormick, 2012). the gh/igf-i axis interacts with the reproductive endocrine axis in the regulation of the initiation of puberty and other aspects of reproductive development in teleosts (taranger et al., 2010). for example, the decision in salmonids to mature is believed to be linked to growth and lipid reserves several months prior to developmental changes in the gonad (larsen et al., 2006; medeiros et al., 2018; silverstein et al., 1998; thorpe, 2007). this is likely a consequence of the fact that maturation depends on parameters related to growth and metabolism, such as size, energy reserves, and growth rate, at a specific stage (“critical period”) several months prior to histological indications of gonadal development (taranger et al., 2010; thorpe, 2007; thorpe et al., 1998). thus, the gh/igf-i axis plays a role in the major life history transitions that define salmonid life histories. due to these interactions, as well as the role of the gh/igf-i axis in the regulation of growth and metabolism, gh/igf-i axis components show promise for use as indicators in fisheries and aquaculture studies. plasma igf-i is a well-established indicator of growth rate (beckman, 2011; perez-sanchez et al., 2018; picha et al., 2008; pierce et al., 2001), although, as reviewed by beckman (2011), the correlation between igf-i and growth ranges from reliable to non-discernable, reflecting the effects of a range of endogenous and exogenous factors on the gh/igf-i axis. the complex and changeable suite of igfbps present in fish plasma interferes in igf-i assays, resulting in a requirement for an extraction procedure to remove igfbps before assay (shimizu 1999, shimizu 2000, shimizu 2006, plisetskaya, 1998). although less explored, gh also shows promise as an indicator of catabolic status during the extended periods of reduced feeding and growth that occur throughout the life histories of many fish (picha et al., 2008; pierce et al., 2005). understanding the life histories, growth, and metabolic status of wild and cultured salmonids is important in the management of salmonid populations. measurement of gh/igf-i axis components can provide insight in all of these areas. time-resolved fluorimmunoassays (tr-fias) for gh and igf-i enable measurement of protein hormone levels while avoiding the safety, regulatory, and radiolabel decay issues associated with radioimmunoassays. however, to our knowledge, no tr-fia has yet been established for salmonid gh, and no existing trfia for detecting plasma gh in fish is composed of commercially available reagents (fukuda et al., 2015). moreover, current protocols for igf-i tr-fias require beginning the assay directly after completing the binding protein extraction procedure (small and peterson, 2005; hevroy et al., 2013), which complicates the workflow and introduces high levels of ethanol remaining from extraction into the tr-fia, resulting in suboptimal binding conditions. therefore, the aims of this study were to establish and validate tr-fia assays to detect gh and igf-i in salmonid plasma, and to modify igfbp extraction protocols to remove ethanol and allow storage of samples between the extraction and assay procedures. in addition, existing igf-i assay protocols were modified to increase sensitivity. biological validation was provided by gh injection and fasting studies in rainbow trout. 2. materials and methods 2.1. fish rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) used in this study were acquired from a breeding population at the aquaculture research institute (ari) at the university of idaho (moscow, id, usa) and cared for according to the ari's standard operating procedure as described by medeiros et al. (2016). all fish rearing and sampling procedures followed guidelines approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of idaho. 2.2. peptide, hormone, and antibody sources recombinant barramundi (lates calcarifer) and tuna (thunnus maccoyii) igf-i as well as recombinant black bream (acanthopagrus butcheri) gh were purchased from gropep (adelaide, australia). polyclonal rabbit anti-barramundi (l. calcarifer) igf-i and anti-salmon/trout (genus oncorhynchus) gh were also purchased from gropep (adelaide, australia). custom recombinant rainbow trout gh (gh1, genbank accession no. p09538.2) and gilthead seabream (sparus aurata) igf-i were purchased from prospec (new brunswick, nj). both the igf-i and gh antibodies have been used previously, and the specificity tested and confirmed (dyer et al., 2004; le bail et al., 1991; shimizu et al., 2000; small and peterson, 2005). native bovine gh (bgh) was purchased from us biologicals (salem, ma). 2.3. peptide and hormone labeling europium (eu)-labeled gh and igf-i (eu-gh and eu-igf-i, respectively) were prepared by perkinelmer (waltham, ma) via labeling of recombinant barramundi igf-i and recombinant rainbow trout gh with delfia® eu-n1 itc lanthanide chelate (ref 1244–302, perkinelmer, waltham, ma). initial labeling of igf-i under conditions favoring only n-terminal attachment of the europium chelate failed; therefore, this condition was relaxed. 2.4. pituitary homogenate for demonstration of competitive binding, a crude pituitary homogenate from rainbow trout was prepared by homogenizing 10 whole pituitaries in 1 ml of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (ph 7.8) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 5 min. the solution was stirred at 4 °c for 1 h and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °c for 30 min. the supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and considered to be at a concentration of 1 ×. 2.5. tr-fia for gh the assay was performed in goat anti-rabbit-coated yellow 96-well plates (perkinelmer, waltham, ma) and run over the course of 4 days, with 3 overnight incubations. the standard curve consisted of 8 serially diluted points, ranging from 500 to 0.03 ng/ml, with 4-fold dilutions. on the first day, the 96-well plate was washed 5× with 300 μl of delfia® wash solution (perkinelmer, waltham, ma) per well before adding delfia® assay buffer (dab; perkinelmer, waltham, ma) and 20 μl of the rabbit anti-salmon/trout gh polyclonal antiserum (diluted 1:5000; gropep, adelaide, australia). the non-specific binding (nsb) wells received 165 μl of dab while the maximum binding (b0), standard curve, and unknown sample wells received 145 μl of dab plus 20 μl of the primary antibody. the plate was then sealed and incubated for 24 h at 4 °c with constant slow shaking on an orbital plate shaker (vwr, radnor, pa). on the second day, the plate was washed 5× with 300 μl of delfia® wash solution per well and the standard curve and unknown samples were plated. both the nsb and b0 wells received 165 μl of dab. the standard curve was generated by adding 125 μl of a known recombinant barramundi igf-i concentration and 40 μl of dab. the unknown plasma samples were determined by adding 125 μl of plasma diluted as necessary in dab and 40 μl of dab. the standard curve was run in duplicate and unknowns in triplicate. the plate was then sealed and incubated for 24 h at 4 °c with constant slow shaking l.r. medeiros, et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 248 (2020) 110751 2 on an orbital plate shaker. on day 3, the plate was not washed and 20 μl of eu-gh (diluted to 25 ng/ml with dab) was added to all wells except the blank and total count (tc) wells. the plate was then sealed and incubated for 18 h at 4 °c with constant slow shaking on an orbital plate shaker. on the fourth and final day, the plate was washed 5× with 300 μl of delfia® wash solution per well. 200 μl of delfia® enhancement solution was added to all wells, and 5 μl of the eu-gh label (made up the previous day) was added to the tc wells. the plate was then sealed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with moderate shaking on an orbital plate shaker, and the time resolved fluorescence was measured with a victor™ x4 multilabel plate reader (perkinelmer, waltham, usa) using the europium program. briefly, the well is pulsed 1000 times per second with an excitation light of 340 nm, in the period between flashes the sample fluorescence is measured (europium fluoresces at 615 nm) for 400 μs after a delay time of 400 μs. assay calculations were conducted as follows, using average fluorescence counts for replicate wells. the value for the blank wells was subtracted from all wells, and then the nsb value was subtracted from remaining wells. the b0 (maximum binding) was calculated and standards and unknowns (b) expressed as %b0 ((b/b0) × 100). the standard curve was generated by plotting %b0 against known igf-i concentrations on a linear y-axis and a log x-axis and fitting a curve using a four-parameter-logistic equation. unknown sample values were interpolated from the standard curve; samples with percent binding values above 80% and below 20% were re-assayed. the total counts (tc) value was multiplied by 4 in order to account for the difference in label volume added to the total count well versus what was added to the sample wells. percent total counts was calculated as (b0/tc) × 100. the minimum detection limit of the assay was calculated using the mean count of the zero standard minus two standard deviations, expressed as b/b0, and used to interpolate a value from the standard curve (shimizu et al., 2006). 2.6. tr-fia for igf-i 2.6.1. igf-i acid-ethanol-cryoprecipitation extraction procedure the procedure was modified from daughaday et al. (1980) and shimizu et al. (2000) to remove ethanol and enable storage of extracted samples. briefly, 125 μl of blood plasma was acidified with acidethanol (87.5% 200 proof ethanol and 12.5% 2 n hcl, at a ratio of 1,4 v:v). the solution was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 1860 × g for 30 min. the resulting supernatant was decanted into a fresh tube and neutralized with 0.855 m tris base at a ratio of 5:2 v:v, respectively. the samples were again thoroughly mixed and incubated at −20 °c for one hour, and then centrifuged at 1860 × g for 30 min. the resulting supernatant was decanted into a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, the amount decanted was noted, and then the sample was dried under vacuum for 4 h. samples were reconstituted in nanopure water at the same volume that was transferred following the final centrifugation, vortexed thoroughly, and incubated in a water bath set at 37 °c for 30 min. samples used in the extraction comparison assays were made up from recombinant barramundi igf-i. the extracted and dried down samples followed the protocol outlined above, whereas the extracted samples followed the protocol up until the final centrifugation, and then the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and assayed immediately. the aeb standard curve samples were made up in neutralized extraction buffer but not subject to the extraction procedure. to account for the dilution factor inherent to this extraction process, the standard curve was prepared at 7-times the normal concentration. in both extraction procedures, the entire standard curve was prepared and then extracted. the extracted samples were run in triplicate. 2.6.2. tr-fia for igf-i the igf-i time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (tr-fia) protocol was based on small and peterson (2005) and hevroy et al. (2013) with modifications. the incubation timing, volumes, and time resolved fluorescence detection employed in the igf-i assay were identical to those in the gh assay. the standard curve consisted of 8 serially diluted points, ranging from 400 to 0.024 ng/ml, with 4-fold dilutions. the rabbit anti-barramundi igf-i polyclonal antiserum was diluted 1:1500 (gropep, adelaide, australia). the eu-igf-i label was diluted to 50 ng/ ml. unknowns were extracted and dried down plasma reconstituted in nanopure water as described above and diluted as necessary in dab. assay calculations and interpolation of unknowns were conducted as described for the gh assay. 2.7. in vivo experiments 2.7.1. ip injection experiment to determine if exogenous gh increases plasma igf-i in rainbow trout, twenty fish were intraperitoneally (ip) injected with either vehicle or vehicle containing bgh. while under anesthetic, fish were ip injected with either 1 μl vehicle × g fish−1 (vehicle fish [145.3 ± 13.2 g, n = 10]) or with vehicle plus bgh at a dose of 2.5 μg bgh × 1 μl × g fish−1 (bgh-injected fish [140.7 ± 9.8 g, n = 7]). the vehicle was sterile-filtered 0.9% nacl containing 0.1% bsa. at t = 12 h, fish were lethally sampled, and a blood sample collected (see section 2.8 sampling procedures below). fish were held in 595 l circular tanks under a simulated normal photoperiod. tanks were supplied with 17–18 °c well water by a recirculating system that was composed of a bubble bead mechanical and biological filter and u-shaped settling basin. flow rate was approximately 11 l min−1. fish were fasted for the duration of the experiment. 2.7.2. fasting experiment an experiment was conducted to assess the effects of fasting on the gh/igf-i axis in rainbow trout. for the duration of the experiment, fish were held in 1130 l circular tanks under a simulated normal photoperiod. tanks were supplied with 10 °c water by a recirculating system that was composed of a chiller, settling pool, sand filter, a uv treatment, and a biological filter. flow rate was approximately 14 l min−1. fish were fed to satiation 5 days a week with a standard commercial trout diet (5.5 mm pellets; skretting usa, tooele, ut). at the onset of the experiment, 22 fish with an average mass of 686.3 ± 25.6 g were split into two groups (n = 11 per treatment). the control group (fed) continued to be fed as described above, while the other group (fasted) was fasted for the duration of the experiment. fish were individually identified with passive integrated transponder (pit) tags inserted into the body cavity (biomark, inc., boise, id). on march 20th, 2019 (4 weeks after the start of the experiment), all fish were lethally sampled (see sampling procedures below). 2.8. sampling procedures lethal sampling consisted of recording (1) the pit tag code, (2) total body weight and length and (3) collecting a blood sample. briefly, fish were anesthetised in ms-222 (0.1 g l−1; western chemical, ferndale, wa) and blood sampled from caudal vessels using a 23g needle attached to a 1 ml syringe coated with heparin (10 mg/ml; sigma- aldrich, st. louis, mo). blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the plasma aspirated and frozen immediately on dry ice. plasma samples were stored at −80 °c until laboratory analysis. 2.9. statistical analyses the experimental data were analyzed using prism 8.2 (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca). plasma hormone concentrations were subjected to unpaired t-tests. plasma parallelism was objectively evaluated by comparing hillslope values between individual curves and the standard curve for the respective assay using nonlinear regression l.r. medeiros, et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 248 (2020) 110751 3 analysis evaluated over the usable portion (20 to 80% of maximum binding) of the standard curve. for all analyses, the level of significance was evaluated at p ≤ .05, and values are expressed as the average ± the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). 3. results eu-gh was labeled at a ratio of 7.6 europium chelate molecules per molecule of gh protein. at the label concentration employed, this gave approximately 120,000 counts per 20 μl. the primary antibody bound approximately 20% of the label in the b0 wells at the concentration employed. specific binding of the europium-labeled gh was displaced by increasing amounts of unlabeled gh (fig. 1). serial dilutions of pituitary homogenate (fig. 1a) and blood plasma (fig. 1b) from rainbow trout were parallel to the standard curve (p = .67 and 0.43, respectively). the ed80 and ed20 were 0.58 ± 0.06 ng/ml (n = 8) and 28.1 ± 1.1 ng/ml (n = 8), respectively. the minimum detection limit of the assay was 0.22 ± 0.08 ng/ml (n = 8). the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 4.1% and 13.4%, respectively (n = 23). interspecies specificity of the primary antibody was tested by running a serial dilution of recombinant black bream gh, which was found to be not parallel to the standard curve (data not shown; p < .05). during development and validation, it was discovered that the assay required at least a 2-fold dilution of plasma prior to assay. this was deduced from observations that plasma run neat yielded %b below 20%, but when the same sample was diluted 2- to 10-fold the results implied that the neat value should have been within the 20 to 80% binding range. eu-igf-i was labeled at a ratio of 2.3 europium chelate molecules per molecule of igf-i protein. at the label concentration employed in this study, this resulted in approximately 95,000 counts per 20 μl. the primary antibody bound approximately 25% of the label in the b0 wells at the primary antibody concentration employed. specific binding of the europium-labeled igf-i was displaced by increasing amounts of unlabeled igf-i and serial dilutions of blood plasma from rainbow trout were parallel to the standard curve (fig. 2; p =.83). the ed80 and ed20 were 0.23 ± 0.02 ng/ml (n = 8) and 6.5 ± 0.4 ng/ml (n = 8), respectively. the minimum detection limit of the assay was 0.028 ± 0.008 ng/ml (n = 8). the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 3.0% and 6.5%, respectively (n = 7). interspecies specificity of the primary antibody was further tested by running serial dilutions of recombinant tuna and gilthead seabream igf-i, which were found to be parallel to the standard curve (data not shown; p = .22 and 0.97, respectively). maximum binding was reduced from near 100% to approximately 80% of b0 in extracted standard curves or curves made up in neutralized acid/ethanol buffer versus the neat standard curve (fig. 3; top parameter values from curve fit equation were significantly different, fig. 1. displacement curves for recombinant rainbow trout gh assay standards, serially diluted rainbow trout pituitary homogenate (a), and serially diluted rainbow trout blood plasma (b). serial dilutions of pituitary homogenate and blood plasma from rainbow trout were parallel to the standard curve (p = .67 and 0.43, respectively). fig. 2. displacement curves for recombinant barramundi igf-i standards and serially diluted rainbow trout blood plasma. serial dilutions of blood plasma from rainbow trout were parallel to the standard curve (fig. 2; p = .83). fig. 3. displacement curves for recombinant barramundi igf-i standards that have been extracted and run using the extraction and tr-fia procedures outlined in this study (black symbols and lines) compared to the displacement curves for recombinant barramundi igf-i standards that have been extracted and run using the unmodified extraction protocol (gray symbols and lines), which does not remove the ethanol from the assay. maximum binding was significantly reduced in curves containing neutralized acid/ethanol buffer when compared to curves produced using the modified extraction protocol (top parameter values from curve fit equation were significantly different, p < .05). l.r. medeiros, et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 248 (2020) 110751 4 p < .05). increased variability between replicates was also evident in curves containing extraction buffers. a similar reduction in percent b0 and increase in variability between replicates was found when ethanol at the final concentration in neutralized extract (50%) was added to b0 wells. additionally, the reduction in percent b0 and increase in variability decreased with decreasing ethanol concentration (data not shown). the reduction in percent b0 and increased variability were eliminated when the standard curve was dried down after extraction and reconstituted. curves reconstituted in ddh20 were more similar to the neat standard curve than when reconstituted in dab (data not shown). based on a comparison of the extracted and dried down versus neat standard curves, the recovery of igf-i after extraction, drying down, and reconstitution was 80% (based on values interpolated from 20, 50, and 80% binding), and recovery was similar across the working range of the assay. based on these results, samples were dried down and resuspended in ddh20 after extraction before being run in the tr-fia igf-i assay. using the tr-fia, the response of circulating igf-i to ip injection with bgh was examined in rainbow trout. twelve hours post-injection, fish injected with bgh experienced a nearly two-fold increase in plasma igf-i levels when compared to fish injected with vehicle alone (p < .01, fig. 4). following a four-week period of fasting, fasted fish weighed significantly less than the fed treatment group (p < .001), which corresponded to a 12.5% decrease in weight compared to their initial weight versus the 14.2% increase that the fed group experienced (fig. 5). this expected decrease in weight was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma gh levels (p < .01, fig. 6a) and a significant decrease in plasma igf-i levels (p < .01, fig. 6b). 4. discussion the present study developed and validated a tr-fia for rainbow trout gh. this study also established modifications to the standard igf binding protein extraction procedure, and validated modifications to an existing tr-fia igf-i for use in rainbow trout, resulting in an improved assay and more efficient workflow. the assays, including the modification to the extraction procedure, are intended to target the physiological range for plasma gh and igf-i observed in salmonid species. as with other tr-fias, these assays provide a cost-effective, convenient alternative to radioimmunoassays (rias) that provide comparable sensitivity. additionally, as the recombinant rainbow trout gh is available for purchase through prospec, all components of the tr-fias are commercially available to any interested party with the laboratory resources to perform tr-fias. availability of these assays will enable investigation of the role of the gh/igf-i axis in studies on the life history, growth, reproduction, and response to environmental stressors in rainbow trout and other salmonids, which are species of cultural, conservation, economic, and recreational importance. the gh utilized in this study was a custom recombinant hormone constructed based on the rainbow trout gh1 sequence, that demonstrated similar displacement to native ghs employed by other studies (le bail et al., 1991; wilkinson et al., 2006). this implies that the labeling process does not appear to have affected its ability to bind to the fig. 4. effect of vehicle alone or vehicle with bgh on plasma igf-i levels 12 h post-injection. values are expressed as means±sem (n = 10 and 7, respectively). asterisks indicate significant differences (p < .01) between treatments. fig. 5. percent change in body mass of rainbow trout fasted for 4 weeks (mean ± sem;

wilkinson et al., 2006) taking the dilution into account. considering the quantification limits of gh rias validated for use in salmonids, this gh tr-fia provides a safe, convenient, and costcomparable alternative to traditional rias. specific binding proteins have been identified and characterized for both gh (ghbp) and igf-i, which modulate their physiological effects (duan and xu, 2005; wood et al., 2005). more information exists regarding the function and regulation of igfbps (reviewed by duan and xu, 2005) than that for ghbps (baumann, 2002; fisker, 2006). the vast majority (approximately 99.7%) of igf-i circulates bound to high affinity igfbps, which interfere in igf-i assays, thus plasma igf-i should not be quantified without first removing igfbps with a specific extraction procedure (shimizu et al., 1999; shimizu et al., 2000). in contrast, extraction procedures for ghbps are not employed in salmonid gh assays due to lower amounts of gh bound to specific ghbps (bjornsson et al., 1994; le bail et al., 1991; sohm et al., 1998; wilkinson et al., 2006). in the present study, it was determined that the ethanol remaining from the standard acid-ethanol cryoprecipitation (aec) igfbp extraction method developed by shimizu et al. (2000) reduced maximum binding to approximately 80% of b0 and increased variability between replicates in the igf-i tr-fia. the effect of ethanol on the igf-i tr-fia is likely worse than in igf-i rias because the proportion of extracted sample in the reaction volume is higher (125 of 165 μl in tr-fia vs 10 of 160 μl or 36 of 350 μl in ria). therefore, ethanol was removed by drying down and reconstituting samples, which restored binding and reduced variability. this modification has the additional benefits of separating the days on which the samples are extracted and run in the tr-fia (since samples in aec extraction buffers cannot be stored) and enables concentration of samples. in the current study, igf-i extraction efficiency (including drying down and reconstitution) was calculated by interpolating the values at 20, 50, and 80% binding from an unextracted standard curve and also from a standard curve that had been extracted, dried down, and reconstituted, and then comparing the values. the extraction efficiency was found to be between 78 and 80% at all three points, implying that the loss is not concentration dependent. the loss of immunoreactive igf-i is likely due to protein damage from exposure to low ph and ethanol during the extraction procedure, adsorption to surfaces, and precipitation in the pellet. the loss is probably less in fish plasma samples due to the protective nature of the plasma matrix, and thus the 80% value represents a minimal extraction efficiency. fish igf-i ria and tr-fia procedures do not include correction for extraction efficiency because this factor in fish plasma is not known (ferriss et al., 2014; hevroy et al., 2013; shimizu et al., 2000; small and peterson, 2005). to provide results comparable to existing studies, we do not propose to correct igf-i values measured with the present igf-i extraction procedures and tr-ria for extraction efficiency. extracted and reconstituted rainbow trout blood plasma and reconstituted recombinant tuna and sea bream igf-i diluted in parallel with the igf-i standard curve in the tr-fia. this indicates that the assay is valid for use in rainbow trout and suggests that it will work in other fish species as well. these results were expected based on previous assays utilizing the same antibody (dyer et al., 2004; shimizu et al., 2000; small and peterson, 2005). initial trials followed an established igf-i tr-fia protocol with addition of the primary antibody, standards/unknowns, and label on the first day, followed by a single overnight incubation (small and peterson, 2005). however, this was found to result in poor assay sensitivity (data not shown). simultaneous incubation of the main assay reactants could result in loss of standards/ unknowns and label in the following wash step. therefore, the addition of reagents was separated, with overnight incubations between each step, similar to ria protocols. this modification decreased the minimum detectable level by approximately 7-fold compared to other tr-fias for igf-i. so, while the present tr-fia requires a longer timeframe to complete it is provides improved sensitivity compared to other tr-fias and a reliably accurate, highly sensitive, convenient, and cost-effective alternative to ria for igf-i. biological validation of the igf-i tr-fia and the modifications to the igfbp extraction procedure was provided by a gh injection study using rainbow trout. gh is a major positive regulator of liver igf-i production, and increases circulating igf-i under fed conditions (bergan-roller and sheridan, 2018; moriyama et al., 2000; reindl and sheridan, 2012; wood et al., 2005). a sample collected 12 h post-injection confirmed that bgh elicited a significant increase in circulating levels of igf-i, in agreement with previous studies in rainbow trout (biga et al., 2005). this result confirms that the igfbp extraction procedure and igf-i assay can measure physiologically relevant changes in plasma igf-i in rainbow trout. biological validation of both assays and the extraction procedure was provided by a fasting study. although gh stimulates liver igf-i production and increases circulating igf-i in fed animals, the situation is different during fasting. in general, for fish and mammals alike, fasting increases blood plasma gh (bjornsson et al., 2018; duan and plisetskaya, 1993; pierce et al., 2005; small and peterson, 2005) while at the same time blood plasma igf-i is reduced (bjornsson et al., 2018; cohick and clemmons, 1994; moriyama et al., 1994; pierce et al., 2001; pierce et al., 2005). to determine whether these changes could be detected using the new assays, we conducted a 4-week fasting experiment using mature rainbow trout. as expected, over the course of the 4-week period, the body mass of the control fish increased whereas fasted fish experienced a decrease in body mass. after 4 weeks of fasting plasma gh was significantly increased and plasma igf-i significantly reduced compared to controls. this provides evidence that physiologically relevant changes in plasma gh and igf-i can be measured using these assays and the extraction procedure. although expected, the results of the present study add to the body of evidence on regulation of the gh/igf-i axis in fishes. the increase in plasma igf-i after gh injection adds to the many studies showing that gh is the major positive regulator of circulating igf-i in the fed state. however, during fasting, a metabolic state termed acquired gh resistance develops, in which the liver becomes resistant to stimulation of igf-i production by gh (kelley et al., 2000). gh resistance appears to be due to both liver receptor downregulation and inhibition of postreceptor signaling pathways (gray et al., 1990; perez-sanchez et al., 1995; perez-sanchez et al., 2018; thissen et al., 1999). the resulting decrease in circulating igf-i is thought to lead to increases in pituitary gh secretion via relaxation of negative feedback (blaise et al., 1995; fruchtman et al., 2000; perez-sanchez et al., 1992; yamashita and melmed, 1986). the pattern of increased gh and reduced igf-i in response to fasting found in the present study is consistent with this model. this is believed to be an adaptive response of gh to nutritional conditions requiring catabolism of body tissues to support metabolism; gh's growth-promoting role is turned off and its lipolytic, energy mobilizing role is turned on (bergan-roller and sheridan, 2018; perez- sanchez et al., 2018; reindl and sheridan, 2012). because of the central importance of the gh/igf-i axis in both growth and energy mobilization, gh/igf-i axis components can be used as indicators of growth and nutritional or metabolic status in fisheries and aquaculture studies. in addition, the gh/igf-i axis interacts with other physiological systems, particularly those that regulate life history transitions linked to growth. thus, quantification of plasma gh and igf-i levels provides considerable insight into the physiological l.r. medeiros, et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 248 (2020) 110751
