are increasingly used in the industry to improve all types of accurate inspections [1]. the sensors are used to ensure safety through continuous monitoring of aircraft maintenance, data loading and relaying on icing conditions, and continuous monitoring. the sensors increase the ability to depend on functional complexity and observe the world around us [2]. in almost all cases, human beings have been created to work to make their lives more accessible and better. setting the mood, switching conventional heat pump water heaters, ensuring safety, tracking devices, and much more [3]. the specific inputs can be motion, humidity, pressure, light, heat, or any other environmental phenomena [4]. there are different kinds of sensors that are generally used to detect any change in various applications and utilize novel techniques to detect physical and chemical parameters [5]. most of the sensors are used for measuring physical properties like temperature, resistance, capacitance, conduction, heat transfer, etc. however, some sensors are also used to find the thermal and mechanical properties, wettability, and electrical conductivity [6]. our daily life encounters different sensors such as temperature (e.g., ir (infrared sensors)) [7], proximity (e.g., touch sensors, position sensors) [8–10], motion (e.g., accelerometer sensors, rotation position sensors) [11,12], light [13,14], ultrasonic [15], heat [16], force/ pressure [17], humidity [18,19], sound [20], pir [21,22], strain and weight [23,24], electric current [25], magnetic [26], gas and smoke [27,28] etc. and a myriad of other uses are shown in (fig. 1) [29,30]. furthermore, sensors and artificial intelligence (ai) can instantly alert physicians and patient visitors when they fail to sanitize their hands before entering the hospital room. ai tools can be built into smart homes, and technology can covertly monitor frail elderly for behavioral cues of an impending health crisis [31]. volatile organic compounds (vocs) are a kind of primary pollutants and highly reactive organic compounds [32]. vocs are compounds with high vapor pressure and low water solubility. many vocs are man-made chemicals used and manufactured in refrigerants, pharmaceuticals, and paints. certain vocs are suspected or proven carcinogens [33]. it is released as a gas from particular liquids or solids [34]. for example, commonly vocs may be used in our daily life such as 1,3-butadiene [c4h6], formaldehyde [ch2o], benzene [c6h6], ethylene glycol [c2h6o2], toluene [c7h8], dichloromethane (dcm) [ch2cl2], xylene [c8h10], and tetrachloroethylene [c2cl4] [35,36]. vocs contain a range of chemicals, some of which may have long- and short-term adverse health effects. the concentration of many vocs is typically ten (10) times higher indoors than outdoors [37]. vocs can cause serious health problems in humans when absorbed or inhaled through the skin. exhaust streams, aerosols, and solvents employed in unventilated areas can produce dangerous toxins [38]. humans may experience dizziness, memory loss, headaches, and visual disturbances if exposed to large amounts. exposure to high-level vocs may cause a variety of health effects, including throat discomfort, and nose and eye irritation [39]. some compounds can cause even cancer in animals, as well as some suspected, are cause to cancer in humans. also, vocs damage the kidneys, liver, or central nervous system and nausea, dyspnea, loss of coordination, allergic skin reaction, conjunctival irritation, headache, and declines in serum cholinesterase levels, and emesis [39,40]. volatile organic compounds (vocs) are responsible for scent odors and perfume odors, as well as pollutants [41]. vocs play an important role in the formation of ground-level ozone (o3) and fine particles in the atmosphere. under sunlight, vocs react primarily with nitrogen oxides (nox) emitted from vehicles, power plants, and industrial activities to create ozone (o3), which in turn contributes to the formation of fine particles [42]. moreover, vocs also actively participated in the communication between plants and animals, such as attractants for preventing predation, pollinators, and even interactions between plants [43]. the sensors can give remarkable signals with low energy consumption and offer excellent performance with even simple device configurations [44,45]. conductivity change is the most frequently used property in a polypyrrole (ppy)-based sensors. it has been reported that conductivity enhancement is observed in the reason of ppy-based sensors towards the detection of carbon monoxide (co) [46], carbon dioxide (co2) [47], nitrogen dioxide (no2) [48,49], hydrogen (h2) [50], hydrogen chloride (hcl) [51,52], hydrogen sulfide (h2s) [53], 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid/ ethanoic acid (c8h6cl2o3) [54]. in contrast, the conductivity reduction of the nh3 analyte has been reported. in the case of dimethyl methyl phosphonate (dmmp) fig. 1. the average power consumption of various types of sensors [29,30]. m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 3 [c3h9o3p]-based sensors also work on conductivity enhancement against common analyte gases. however, the trend is more complicated in the case of ppy which is increased and enhancement also reduction in conductivity reported against nh3 and h2s analytes [55,56]. ppy has a good conductivity for different analysts as nh3, no2, h2s, h2, co, co2, hcl, ch3cooh, and dimethyl methyl phosphonate (dmmp) at room temperature [57–62]. therefore, the situation of ppy depends on the specific reason and step-by-step basis (table 1). all the mechanisms mentioned in table 1 can be considered as ppy sensing mechanisms. the ppy sensors demonstrate excellent performance in terms of selectivity, good stability, reproducibility, and immunity to humidity. ppy has shown good conductivity (experimental 2000 s.cm-1 and theoretical 7600 s.cm-1) chrematistics in comparison with the other polymers such as polythiophene (pth) (experimental 100 s.cm-1 and theoretical 169 s. cm-1) according to table 2 [65]. it also shows a high, fast, and opposite reaction. these sensors facilitate meeting the specifications of the actual practical applications [60]. ppy has received much attention or use in the fabrication of gas sensors [66-69]. it is due to their reasonable excellent mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and low cost. from the literature survey, we have observed that in the case of nh3 molecules conductivity increases [60]; no2 molecule’s conductivity increases [61]; h2s, h2, co, co2, hcl, ch3cooh molecule’s conductivity increases [57–59]; all of these make them the chemical sensors use by ppy for exploring gas sensing applications. in the following, we will be discussing the use of ppy to detect toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (co) [70], hydrogen sulfide (h2s) [57], and carbon dioxide (co2) [71], and vocs (e.g., methanol [ch3oh], ethanol [c2h5oh], chloroform [chcl3], toluene [c7h8], and n-hexane [c6h14]), as shown in (table 3) [72–79]. one of the famous vocs is methanol. it is a toxic gas, with a variety of use in industry, as a solvent, in the synthesis of other organic chemicals, as an additive to gasoline, etc. many sensing materials such as oxide semiconductors, nano-thin films, electronic conductometry, and direct spectroscopic techniques have been explored earlier for the detection of methanol. some ppy, are also reported as potential materials for sensing methanol vapor. the monomer and polymerized form of the ppy are shown in (fig. 2). the effects of side-chain lengths on sensing features and characteristics of ppy are also duly pointed out, and their emerging application for gas sensing is presented. this review includes focuses on complementary aspects of both theory and experiments on ppy-based sensors. the systematic exposition of doping, surface modification chain selection, and ppy-chainarrangements is also new. in addition, the tables and discussions given herein on all reported families of conducting polymers (cps) and their current utilities will help a wide spectrum of researchers. furthermore, the gaps identified will enable the further activity of volatile organic compounds (vocs). in summary, we come up with the idea of writing a new review in this field because researchers face many challenges when working with ppy-based sensors. in addition, when we read and watch research articles, we need to remember important points and find out the research gaps. that’s why the information in this review is most important, as it contains all current research related to these regions and is used to gather new knowledge and skills about different sensors like gas sensors, flexible sensors, electrochemical sensors, optical sensors, etc. using ppy. moreover, the aim of this review is to create readability and to fill the knowledge gap in the best resources available in the literature. furthermore, this review paper is needed to clarify the state of knowledge, determine the necessity of research, explain the obvious contradictions, and even reach a consensus in places that did not even exist before. therefore, this review will be helpful for all researchers working in this field. 2. synthesis and recent modification strategies of ppy ppy was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization technique using pyrrole monomer (c4h4nh) in an aqueous solution for 4 h at room temperature [80]. after synthesis, ppy is very difficult to process because it is non-thermoplastic, brittle, rigid, non-degradable, and insoluble in common solvents. it is an oxidized form of a positively charged p-type conducting polymer that loses conductivity and becomes charged when over-oxidized [81]. it has low mechanical strength and is insulating in its neutral state. however, we found from the literature survey that the ppy-modified electrode enhanced the electron transport efficiency, thus enhancing the electron utilization efficiency of microorganisms, thereby improving the denitrification performance of the system [82]. in addition, we also found from literature surveys, ft-ir spectroscopy, and elemental analysis that it is proportional to the solubility of the precursor polymers in organic solvents. in this case, the ppy(so3h)-dehs powder has shown maximum solubility in water (~4% (w/v)) and a film conductivity of ~5 × 10–1 s/cm [83]. the surface changes of ppy result in improving gas sensitivity [84]. surface modification is generally divided into two categories: physical and chemical [85]. so far, wet chemical treatments [86] and organo-silanization [87] approaches have been used for surface modification of ppy. besides, carbon-doped ppy has been reported wherein electronic properties are well-tuned, which in turn leads to enhanced gas sensitivity. specifically, carbon doping increases the electron mass transfer from the valence to the conduction band [88]. the phenomenon results in efficient electronic interaction between the conductive surface and target molecules of a desirable sensitivity [89]. ppy is also suitable for sensing nh3 analytes [90], hence it is employed in gas sensors for detection of the same. the interaction between ppy and gas analyte can be rather strong even at room temperature (this is unlike the case for sensors made of oxide semiconductors) [91]. 3. role of ppy sensitivity towards inorganic gases and vocs it has been continuously reported that some ppy demonstrates good sensing performance for the detection of vocs. moreover, these ppy has shown lower detection limits and proper working competence under ambient conditions which is mainly due to their conductivity nature. ppy-based sensors are sensitive to gas molecules such as acetone, alcohol, benzene, toluene, and many biological species [92]. however, both the sensitivity and selectivity of ppy to analytes vary significantly with the environment [93,94]. among the various cps, ppy is intrinsically better for the detection of vocs, due to its superior electronic and ionic conductivity and also its chemical steadiness. doping ppy with relevant secondary elements can enhance its sensitivity toward vocs detection [95]. furthermore, it has been shown that the performances of ppy are often hampered by atmospheric moisture. for example, it is reported that ppy’s sensitivity towards co and vocs decreases by a certain percentage (40%, 60%, or 80%) with an increase in the moisture concentration (4–70%) [96,97]. this suggests that the sensitivity of ppy-based sensors depends on environmental factors, including humidity, temperature, and incident light [98]. the ppy and its composites are found to be better sensing materials for some vocs for example methanol [99], chloroform [100], and ammonia [101,102]. the density-functional theory (dft) is a computational quantum-mechanical (qm) modeling approach used in the area table 1 some polymers have been employed before for gas (including voc) sensors. mechanisms polymers analysts conductivity references

structure (mainly the ground state) of multi-body systems, especially atoms, molecules, and solids [103]. dft and time-dependent dft (td-dft) calculations are used to study the doping and undoping processes of ppy, i.e., the tunable nature of ppy. jayasundara et al. have reported that in the case of npy, p-doping leads to increased conductivity, but decreased bandgap and resistance. whereas in the case of npy+27 the reverse trend is observed in terms of n-doping or reduction [104]. in the following section we will be discussing the ppy for no2 detection; ppy for co and co2 detection; and ppy for vocs detection. 3.1. role of ppy for no2 detection in general, nitrogen dioxide (no2) poisoning is harmful to all kinds of life, such as chlorine gas poisoning and carbon monoxide (co) poisoning. it is easily absorbed by the lungs and its inhalation can cause heart failure and sometimes death in severe cases [104]. also, nitrogen oxides (no2, n2o3, n2o4, and n2o5) can irritate the upper respiratory tract and lungs even at low concentrations. just one or two breaths of very high concentrations can cause severe toxicity. for acute exposure, the odor is usually a sufficient precautionary property [105]. finally, ppy is important to many industries because it can detect nitrogen dioxide (no2) accurately and quickly to avoid the gas reaching dangerously toxic levels. ppy sensing films exhibit highly selective and sensitive detection of no2 at ppm level. ppy-based sensors show good reproducibility (99%) and 55% stability [106,107]. recently, it has been reported that ppy-based sensors can be used to detect no2. it is found that ppy exhibits appreciable sensitivity towards no2 gas [108]. also, ppy-based sensors for no2 detection have offered the advantages of high sensitivity, selectivity, short recovery time, cost viability, and low detection limit. these are achieved due to various morphologies of ppy [109]. in particular, mesoporous films of ppy are found to be helpful [110,111]. 3.2. role of ppy for co and co2 detection carbon monoxide (co) is a chemical compound that contains one carbon atom and one oxygen atom and is also a colorless, and odorless

carbon dioxide (co2), it is completely man-made and does not exist naturally in the atmosphere [112,113]. carbon dioxide (co) is an important greenhouse gas that helps trap heat in our atmosphere. without it, our planet would be incredibly cold [114]. it is important to install co alarms on every floor of your home so that all family members can hear the detectors and receive emergency alerts. you should also install co detectors in every bedroom, sleeping area, and common room to provide extra safety while you and your family are sleeping [115]. however, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (co2) in our atmosphere have caused average global temperatures to rise, disrupting other aspects of the earth’s climate [116]. in addition, the detection of the two gases is different because co2 detectors typically use infrared sensors, while co identification uses electrochemical sensors. however, co can also be detected using non-dispersive infrared (ndir) sensing [117]. furthermore, depending on the availability of oxygen (o), the combustion reaction can produce both carbon monoxide (co) and carbon dioxide (co2). inhaled carbon monoxide (co) competes with oxygen (o) for binding to hemoglobin, depriving the organs of oxygen, which can lead to death [118]. the ppy offers advantages such as fast response, cost viability, and low power requirements during co detection. in fact, miniature co gas sensor devices have been realized [119]. however, the technique employed for the fabrication of devices has an essential role. for instance, techniques that give rise to stable ppy and protect the physicochemical properties (charge transport, morphology, surface area, and porosity) of the ppy are considered to be advantageous for co detection [120]. according to the literature survey, we have found ppy is not a good sensor for co, while it is a good one for voc. 3.3. role of ppy for vocs capturing in this review, we discuss different aspects of gas sensors and vocs sensors, which are made employing conducting polymers such as ppy, polyaniline (pani), poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (pedot), and polythiophene (pth), as well as their heterogeneous species with metals, metal oxide nanostructures and nanocarbons (carbon nanotubes (cnts), reduced graphene oxide (rgo)), are used as active layers [121–123]. the ppy exhibits better sensitivity to ethanol when compared with the doped thin film sensors. its response and stability were previously studied [124]. among conducting polymers, ppy has been widely reported for the detection of volatile organic compounds (vocs). commercially, voc sensors find use in photo-ionized detectors (pid), electronic noses, and sensor arrays [125]. besides, ppy has been shown to have high sensitivity to ethanol [c2h5oh], acetone [c3h6o], isoprene [c5h8], and isopropanol [c3h8o] at room temperature. ppy thus has several desirable characteristics relevant to the detection of different kinds of vocs [126]. the cdte/ppy nanocomposites were synthesized and integrated into love wave (l saw) sensors and exhibit high sensitivity to acetone with an estimated lod of 5 ppb. for increased sensitivity is related to the adsorption of acetone on ppy through dipole-dipole interactions and the incorporation of cdte into the indicator /sensitive l saw layer enhances sensor performance [127]. polyaniline (pani) is a highly conductive polymer. due to its unique properties, easy synthesis, low cost, and high environmental stability, it has reached widespread attention in various applications such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and anti-corrosion materials [128]. the electrical conductivity of pani-based compositions can be tightly controlled over a wide range. for pure pani compositions, conductivity levels up to 100 s/cm can be achieved. for polymer blends comprising pani compositions, a full range of conductivity levels from less than 10–10–10–1 s/cm (melt processing) and 10 s/cm (solution processing) can be achieved [129]. an important advantage is that the classical high permeation threshold for the onset of conductivity observed in spherical carbon black-filled plastics does not exist [130]. plasticized pani compositions improve the efficiency of molten processing by reducing melting-viscosity, lowering the processing temperature, and shortening the processing time. improved molten flow features and characteristics make complex-shaped injection molding easier [131]. similarly, the conducting polymers (e.g., ppy and pani) have been fabricated for the detection of vocs. ppy and pani thin sensors have achieved higher sensitivity compared to thick ones owing to 1-minute undoped. ppy exhibited positive sensitivity while pani has negative sensitivity. after gas absorption, the sensitivity increases with the polarity of the absorbing molecules [132]. it has also been found that the cp sensor was very sensitive to the polarity of gas molecules. nevertheless, nearly all types of cps show similar sensing mechanisms in the detection of voc gases wherein bipolar on or free carrier moves and localizes on their surface [133] due to the adsorption of the gases. voc sensors have been found for use in healthcare (e.g., asthma, cancer), safety, environmental monitoring, food and agriculture (e.g., affecting ecosystem & plant growth development), and the oil industry. moreover, vocs appear to detect hybrid nanomaterials with desired properties such as limit of detection, superior sensitivity, synergist effects, and developed performance of voc sensors, as shown in (fig. 3) [134, 135]. this is known to cause a change in the resistance to indicate gas detection. we have found from the literature survey, ppy is better than poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (pedot). the alcohol sensing behaviors of pedot and ppy nanostructures for methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol are investigated, and the sensing mechanisms of these systems are discussed [136]. both the pedot and ppy systems are able to detect very low alcohol concentrations (down to 3 ppm) and exhibit linear behavior with fast response/recovery performance, especially in the case of ethanol vapor [137]. compared to pedot, the ppy-based sensors showed better cyclability in response to pedot when exposed to an ethanol atmosphere. the surface properties of pedot and ppy-sensitive layers were investigated by atomic force microscopy. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was used to study the effects of alcohol exposure on the electrical transport properties of nanostructured pedot and ppy layers [138]. when comparing the sensitivity of them and have been controlled temperature. frequently, ppy shows better sensitivity when compared to pedot-based sensors, as shown in (table 4). in short, we have summarized data of ppy-based voc sensors with sensitivity, detection range, and limit of detection (lod) and compared them with other micro/nano-materials [139–148], as shown in (table 5). 4. computational studies on gas sensing mechanisms of ppy theoretical calculations, especially density functional theory (dft) approaches, have been a useful approach to identifying the physical properties, sensing characteristics, and molecular charge of polymers, especially ppy [149-153]. dft models allow the determination of charge transfer and complex formation when ppy interfaces with gas analytes. these calculations have shown that the electronic structure of ppy offers excellent gas sensors for the detection of co2, so2, co, h2o, nh3, and ch4. they were considered to enhance gas sensitivity along with selectivity by using the b3lyp/ 6–31 g(d) level of theory [154]. computational approaches such as quantum espresso (qe) and vienna ab initio simulation package (vasp) are widely used to study the structural properties, electronic structures, and sensing mechanisms of ppy with good results [155,156]. there are many examples of studying sensing mechanisms using qe and vasp for ppy. ullah et al. have studied theoretically the ppy as a sensor for ammonia through dft methods at the theoretical level of tdb3lyp/6–31 g(d) and b3lyp/6–31 g(d) techniques [155]. they evaluated and calculated the geometric and electronic properties of the polymer (ppy) extrapolated with nh3, also justifying the ammonia sensation by ppy [155]. moreover, coleone, a. p., et al. improved the electronic and optical properties of ppy by employing the dft/m06hf/6–31 g(d) approach [156]. the results also pointed out that ppy-no2 is a promising component for m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 6 exciton dissociation and charge transport. it had been proven that ppy-oh and ppy-och3 can be the most attractive components for optical applications with redshifts of more than 20 nm compared to unchanged ppy [156]. in this signification, the design of components with electronic, reactivity, and optical properties of ppy can be improved by considering the simple hammett parameters [156]. theoretical studies have also been used to investigate the ability of ppy salt for ppy sensing nh3, co2, and co analytes investigated through dft calculations at the theoretical level by b3lyp-d3/6–31++g (d, p) [157,158]. the results showed better selectivity and sensitivity for ammonia compared to co2 and co gas [159]. for example, ppy’s sensitivity towards nh3 decreases by a certain percentage of (50%, 70%, or 90%) with an increase in the moisture concentration (4–75%) [157, 158]. moreover, ullah, h. et al. reported ppy as a sensing mechanism for nh3 gas [155]. they have shown that interaction with ammonia would result in lower resistance for election movements over the oligomer backbone which is due to the reduction of undoped ppy (fig. 4). wasim et al. employed the theoretical level of b3lyp-cp/6–31 g(d) and evaluated the sensing power of ppy for the oxygen, nitrogen, and oxynitrogen analytes ppy-x (x = no, no2, and no2 - ) [159]. the charge transfer from the analyte to the pyrrole oligomers (excluding npy-no2) was more pronounced in the case of nitrite ions (no2 - ) compared to no. it should be considered that ppy is the best conducting polymer (cp) for the detection of nitrite anion (no2􀀀 ) and nh3 at room temperature [154, 159]. 5. theoretical analysis of ppy gas sensors the ppy has been investigated employing the density functional theory (dft), and atoms are also simulated using the super-soft pseudopotential approach [160]. mercury (hg2+) pollution poses significant risks to the environment and human health, even in low concentrations [161]. it can lead to severe organ damage such as different motor diseases and kidney failure cases. among these, the high-performance electrochemistry sensor was designed for detecting hg2+ and the sensor features were greatly improved, which originally came from the schottky barrier of the cuo/cu/ppy electrode [162]. benefiting from the physical barrier, cuo/cu/ppy

gaps between the schottky barrier [163] and the charge concentration of ppy became larger with the synthesis of hg2+ [164], which accelerated the reaction velocity and was more favorable for hg2+ [162]. experimental and theoretical results suggest that introducing a physical barrier to electrochemical metoprolol sensors was an effective way to develop novel sensors [163]. nezhadali et al. have developed electrochemical sensor selective and sensitive detection by employing dft computational approach. the sensitivity has been increased by increasing the conductivity. the sensors are studied by using the multivariate optimization method to deeply study the parameters that affect the imprinting effect. this sensor has shown a good imprinting effect and satisfactory sensing performance through sample analysis [163]. zhuang, y., et al. have confirmed the experimental and dft results indicated that introducing a physical barrier to electrochemistry sensors was an effective means for the development of novel sensors and the excellent sensing performance was analyzed. due to the physical barrier playing a crucial role in electrochemical detection, the sensor can work in seawater [160]. with the increase in hg2+ adsorption, the charge density gap between the schottky barrier and the concentration of ppy charge became wider which accelerated the response dynamics and was more favorable to hg2+ while the sensitive performance was an improvement. ppy film and cuo/cu worked together in the presence of hg2+ with low features such as low detection range, good selection, and strong anti-interference efficiency. aids to calculation system counting system for different numbers of hg2+ adsorbs on cuo/cu/ppy surface using dft method. in this study, they compared adsorption energy (ev) and reaction coordinate of cuo/cu/ppy with hg2+ and the results were + 1 hg2+ (􀀀 1.07 ev), and + 2 hg2+ (􀀀 1.69 ev) shown in fig. 5 [160]. in summary, complementary dft and experimental results can be used to tailor the electronic structure of ppy gas sensing materials [154, 164]. dft tools can be used to select a suitable gas sensing material or even identify the right dopants to enhance selectivity towards target molecules (both organic and inorganic). table 5 the ppy-based voc sensors: sensitivity, detection range, and limit of detection (lod) compared with other

(2022) 113933 8 6. experimental analysis: insights for improving ppy gas sensor’s performance the performance of the ppy mainly depends on the conductivity. from a practical standpoint, sensitivity, selectivity, and operation at room temperature are key parameters. ppy is a p-type semiconductor (resistive gas sensors) and has been evaluated on a lab scale along with these performance parameters [165]. lab-scale investigations have also shown that ppy chains can be formed for enhancing gas sensitivity and charge exchange [166]. thus, a combination of strategies including doping, surface functionalization, and chain formation- is all shown to have relevance in gas detection. in the formation of ppy chains, of particular importance is the role of hydrogen bonds, π–π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. these also improve the mechanical properties for enhancing material stability [167]. furthermore, the conjugated bonds in the ppy can be easily manipulated through doping. specifically, the bond can be reduced (i.e., via n-type doped) or oxidized (via p-type doped). from studies thus far, however, it is clear that doping engineering is important for improving the gas sensing performance with ppy (fig. 6). in this section, we will be discussing the types of gases that can be detected by a particular ppy. the ppy polymer usually shows gassensing properties in an oxidized state. the preparation of ppy can be fig. 5. aids counting system for different numbers of hg2+ adsorbs on cuo/ cu/ppy surface using dft method [152] copyright© 2020 elsevier. fig. 6. the mechanism of doping engineering of ppy and its potential application in advanced various capturing technologies [160] copyright© 2019 royal society of chemistry. m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 9 done through electrochemical polymerization [168,169]. the easy oxidation reactions and low-cost processing of ppy make it an outstanding polymer when compared to other cps in the gas sensor field. moreover, ppy has been applied in different kinds of gas sensors which include bio-sensors, bio-actuators, neural electrodes, and drug delivery [170]. for instance, sajid, h., et al. have reported the sensitivity of ppy towards co, nh3, vocs, and co2 [171,172]. in general, it is discovered that ppy has better sensitivity toward ammonia (nh3) and vocs than other gases [173], as shown in (table 6). computational studies show that ppy forms both doped (ppy+) and undoped (ppy) states; both of which are shown to be good candidates for toxic gas detection (e.g., co, nh3, co2, etc.) [173]. nonetheless, the doped and undoped states of ppy are more sensitive to nh3 gas when compared to co and co2 gases. furthermore, the doped form often shows excellent sensitivity towards nh3 gas when compared to undoped ones, for example upon ethanol gas. 7. application of ppy in capturing recently, ppy has drawn significant attention to the improvement of different types of sensors [174-178]. this is due to the transduction possible using ppy to yield chemical, biochemical, electrical, optical, thermal, or mechanical signals [179]. gas sensors are finding applications in diverse technologies ranging from chemo-resistive sensors, biosensors, micro-electromechanical systems, coatings, and textiles of emerging developments. they have also found use in various sectors such as biomedicine, healthcare, environmental monitoring, etc. there is already substantial research on deploying ppy for real-world applications (including in areas associated with flexible electronics) [180]. nano-sensors have enabled improvements that are otherwise not achievable via conventional sensors, for instance, sensitivity, accuracy, and faster response- have all been possible using ppy-based sensors [181]. in general, ppy is a conductive polymer that has demonstrated sensitivity to various gases and organic vapors (e.g., acetone, ammonia, and ethanol) [173]. methanol and water vapor in the ppy sensors were identified as multiple gases, and the methanol and water vapor absorption competed on the surface of the sensor. the sensitivity increases at low temperatures and low humidity. fast response and recovery times are shown at 25 ◦c. the reproducibility of the ppy under different humidity conditions is good. the optimum operating temperature was studied at 25 ◦c [182]. the carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) was fast detected and sensitive when fabricated a flexible pressure sensor using three-dimensional (3d) ppy foam [183]. ppy was integrated into chemi-resistive sensors and up-to-date, the use of ppy in saw sensors has been found from the literature survey. examples of these include rayleigh wave-based saw sensors for the detection of acetone, ammonia, h2s, and no2, or shear level saw for hydrogen detection (e. g., leaky). based on published research, we have found that the use of ppy in l-saw sensors is less common. however, our modern elementary results suggest the possibility of detecting low concentrations of ammonia in ppy-based l-saw sensors [184]. 7.1. chemical and gas sensors the current research work demonstrates that ppy-based sensors were fabricated through surfactant-assisted doping. the resulting instrument was explored and implemented as an effective gas sensor for vocs and some toxic gases at low ppm levels. ppy nanostructures were produced through the polymerization of chemical oxidative employing different sulfonic acids as surfactants at temperatures of 0–5 ◦c [185]. the doping of sulfonic acid has a high impact on the morphology of ppy compounds, which exhibit compact structures such as amorphous, globular, cauliflower, flakes, and sheets based on surface morphology. the role of the sulfonyl group in ppy has been confirmed through ft-ir spectroscopic analysis. the conductivity of doped ppy was sequentially and gradually increased, and the amount of surfactant added was increased from 0.1 to 2.0 m, depending on the level of doping with concern to the dopant nature. real studies and doped ppy gas sensors were investigated at various ppm levels for different gases. the sensing process following the reaction system between the gas and the sensor material under study has been extensively discussed. the early ppy had 70% and 93% responses to nh3 and cl2 gases, respectively, while the doped ppy had an increased response to most of the vocs and toxic gases under experimental research and studies. extensive studies of the different sensing properties and higher sensitization results of these components demonstrate that surfactant-doped ppy materials have appeared as effective gas sensors with excellent response, repeatability, and retrieval at a minimum of 5 ppm levels [185]. 7.2. the fabric-based chemical gas sensors textile-integrated gas sensors for health or environmental monitoring applications need to be combined with gas sensors integrated into wearable devices. however, the behavior of sensing devices with electro-conductive textile substrates can be highly environmental and aging-dependent [186]. nevertheless, sensors are employed to detect toxic gases/vocs. it showed the full functionality of the image after weaving in different sensing modes and correct sensory responses (fig. 7) [187]. 7.3. graphene-based sensors graphene-based materials have contributed to the development of sensitive sensors and biosensors due to their physical and electrochemical features. the most important features of graphene-based are flexible and stretchable for multi-functionality sensing devices and the major advances in sensor technologies (e.g., gas sensors, cancer biomarker detection, flow sensors, strain sensors, etc.) [188]. moreover, the graphene-based sensors also improve the analytical performance for application in environmental, clinical, and food science, etc., [189]. in addition, the development of graphene-based flexible gas and chemical sensors is reviewed in the preparation of materials, the manufacture of sensors, and their effectiveness. the overview of graphene-based materials and their potential applications in flexible and stretchable wearable electronic devices. herein, mention that singh, eric, et al., are briefly discussed the application of flexible gas sensors for the detection of various hazardous gases including nitrogen dioxide (no2), ammonia (nh3), hydrogen (h2), hydrogen sulfide (h2s), carbon dioxide (co2), sulfur dioxide (so2) and humidity [188]. also, applications of graphene-based materials are also shortened to detect toxic heavy metal ions (cd, hg, pb, cr, fe, ni, co, cu, ag) and volatile organic compounds (vocs) including nitrobenzene, toluene, acetone, formaldehyde, amines, phenols, bisphenol a (bpa), explosives, chemical warfare agents and environmental pollutants [188]. 7.4. nanocomposite-based sensors ppy nanocomposite-based sensors are developed for potential table 6

113933 10 applications such as gas sensors, biosensors, temperature sensors ph sensors, etc. [190,191]. the ppy nanocomposite-based sensors are being improved that enjoy sensitivity, selectivity, rigidity, and real-time measurement. these sensor platforms are helped to create new technologies to ensure environmental and human protection [191]. recently, researchers have made considerable efforts to use ppy nanocomposites to create ppy nanocomposite-based sensors in terms of their promising properties, such as better electrolytic activity, higher electrical conductivity, and effective surface area in comparison to conventional polymers [192]. therefore, relative to their bulk counterparts, nanocomposite-based sensors exhibit unique features and provide the basis for the use of various types of sensors (e.g., gas and chemical, electrochemical and fluorescent, stretchable and bendable strain, as well as tensile strain, etc.) are used to detect drugs and biomolecules as well as many new possibilities [193]. 7.5. graphene-based nanocomposites biosensors ppy nanostructures (e.g., graphene, cnt, metal oxides, metal nanoparticle, metal sulfides, etc.) are discussed in the ppy matrix for developed gas sensing performance [194]. the detailed and systematic discussions on synthesis techniques, gas sensing principles of ppy nanostructures, and its composites with the development of sensor device configurations provide the reader with an in-depth understanding of the above [195]. moreover, the progress of graphene-based nanocomposite biosensors with a wide range of advanced sensitivities, selectivity, and detection for an emerging application. also, the biological function of graphene-based materials and the process of nanocomposite formation and their unique features, surface function, enzyme destabilization techniques, covalent stabilization, physical absorption, and bio-interactions processes with biosensors are studies including good understanding [196]. 7.6. electrochemical sensors the most widely used ppy is a conducting polymer in the design of a bioanalytical sensor. recent advances and issues in the improvement of molecularly printed ppy are considered [197]. the electrochemical sensors have appeared as tools for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) detection due to their cost-effectiveness, easy of fabrication and usage, high sensitivity and selectivity, and better reproducibility [198]. ppy is easily prepared through the polymerization technique and pyrrole is a chemical species, as well as stable semi-conductive polymer components solved by electrochemical methods under conditions of mild synthesis. the ppy is used as a stable molecular structure in which the imprint of the desired pahs is localized in situ; can be fabricated on glassy carbon electrodes [198]. 7.7. optical sensors qin et al., and azzouz et al., have applied ppy to detect volatile organic compounds (vocs), and other sensors like optical, capacitive, and impedance sensors, as shown in table7, use ppy and other materials for various gases and vocs sensors [199–205], through a fiber optic reflection sensor (fors) [206,207]. the traditional interfacial polymerization approach was employed to synthesize sensitive ppy membranes, with higher reflection and lower roughness. the electrical properties of conducting polymers like ppy have changed in the exploration of sensing materials, but their optical properties are rarely explored. moreover, the reflected optical signal also changed from ppy after systematically evaluating the interaction with vocs. qin et al., and ˇsetka et al., have fabricated and exhibited high sensitivity of the ppy in vocs under fors testing with a detection limit of up to 1 ppm [139, 206]. 8. challenges and future prospects polymeric materials such as ppy and their derivatives are manufactured for the following applications: solving medical diagnostics problems, pharmaceutical supply, drug delivery, biomedical products, biotechnology, adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives, coatings, waterborne coatings, re-dispersible lattices, electronics, magnetics, fig. 7. smart textiles-based gas accumulation for health applications; [179]. copyright© 2016 woodhead publishing. m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 11 optoelectronics, etc., are expected to become the general technologies investigated in these research fields. novel sensors and biosensors will explore a variety of construction techniques that use ppy as a sensing component, which can be used to detect small organic, biological, and inorganic, molecular dna. moreover, it can also be used to fabricate heteroatom-doped ppy novel biosensors, and ppy will be furthermore research carried out. the biocompatibility of ppy in various sensing applications needs to be desired furthermore research works in the future. in addition to the large-scale production of monolayer ppy is a big challenge to overcome in near future. the current achievement of polymer materials is the use of polymer nanoparticle drug carriers for combination therapy to treat cancer. ppy nanomaterials are expected to significantly alter combination therapy for cancer treatment by regulating the type of deposit and distribution of multiple drugs at disease sites. therefore, ppy composite materials will also become an important player in the fields of electronic devices and modern medicine. ppy has several desirable properties that include reasonable chemical stability, mechanical flexibility, and eco-friendliness. these make them promising candidates for upcoming technologies wherein gas sensors are required for a wide range of analytes. here, we discuss doping, surface modification, and ppy chain arrangements as important ways to enhance the gas sensing performance of sensors. using insights from both experimental and ab initio studies, we show the current mode of rationalizing or even designing the sensing substrate for a given analyte. we also discuss the most common ppy and its current utilities, from the standpoint of gas sensing. we further identify gaps in the state of the art- both from fundamental and applied standpoints. given the content and scope of this review, we expect this work to spur further work on the use of ppy for the fabrication of gas sensors and associated devices. over the past few decades, numerous sensitive approaches for the detection of nh3 gas have been extensively studied to address environmental and public health concerns. among the commonly used nh3 gas sensing approaches include solid-state sensing techniques, as well as metal oxides and ppy-based sensors handling. in particular, metal oxidebased nh3 gas sensors have been deeply investigated and widely used due to their high internal sensitivity to nh3 gas. however, much effort is still needed to further improve the selectivity of nh3 gas. furthermore, most of the metal oxide-based nh3 gas sensors demand relatively high temperatures, which cannot guarantee real-time detection, portability, and energy-efficient operation [208]. in particular, carbon nanotubes (cnts) or layered graphene are used to lower the operating temperature due to their higher electrical mobility, which can greatly improve the general smoothness of metal oxides recovery rate. but in terms of room temperature activity, the low growth rate of the analytical gas at room temperature and the high absorption energy between the analytical gas molecules still need to be developed. and the rapid recovery of the active part of the sensitive substance quickly returns to its initial state. therefore, future research on metal oxide-based nh3 gas sensors should focus on enhanced selectivity, sensitivity, and room temperature operations. like metal oxide-based nh3 gas sensors, polymer-based nh3 gas sensors are also less selective when implementing polymer sensing layers due to moisture and swelling effects. in fact, the humidity and expansion effects in the air are only a slight defect, for the main defect is caused by long-term instability and irreversibility. although the process of immutability is not clearly explained in the literature, it is mainly attributed to the nucleophilic invasion of the carbon backbone [209]. in addition, long-term stability is rarely found due to camouflage in polymer handling. therefore, in contrast to operating ppy-based nh3 gas sensors and improving long-term stability may be the direction of future research. typically, tdls requires complex sensing system configurations in order to meet a high degree of sensitivity and finality, resulting in high system construction costs. furthermore, complex system configurations may hinder device miniaturization [210,211]. 9. conclusions to conclude, although many past studies have focused on developing a single sensing approach for ppy-based sensors the latest and most advanced sensing technologies are used for the detection of hybrid sensing materials or a mix of sensitive materials. in addition, the field of fancy hybridization is rapidly expanding to sensitive substances or detection techniques to accurately measure volatile organic compounds (vocs) detection. furthermore, since conclusiveness is a most challenging goal for almost all kinds of ppy-based sensors, future experimental research work is also making efforts to improve the selectivity of hybrid ppy-based sensing methods are also required. with the rapid development of accumulation devices such as chemical and gas sensors, table 7 the ppy-based voc sensors: sensitivity, detection range, and limit of detection (lod) compared with other micro/nano-materials (optical, capacitive, and impedance). type of

to fabricating sensing devices in large-scale applications. this review is helpful for all researchers who is doing sensor research on organic gases and vocs detection. declaration of competing

ease of deposition from aqueous and non-aqueous media, adherence to diverse substrates, and high electrical conductivity made ppy a unique choice for sensor development. in recent years, ppy has

structural health monitoring (shm) systems like sensors are increasingly used in the industry to improve all types of accurate inspections [1]. the sensors are used to ensure safety through continuous monitoring of aircraft maintenance, data loading and relaying on icing conditions, and continuous monitoring. the sensors increase the ability to depend on functional complexity and observe the world around us [2]. in almost all cases, human beings have been created to work to make their lives more accessible and better. setting the mood, switching conventional heat pump water heaters, ensuring safety, tracking devices, and much more [3]. the specific inputs can be motion, humidity, pressure, light, heat, or any other environmental phenomena [4]. there are different kinds of sensors that are generally used to detect any change in various applications and utilize novel techniques to detect physical and chemical parameters [5]. most of the sensors are used for measuring physical properties like temperature, resistance, capacitance, conduction, heat transfer, etc. however, some sensors are also used to find the thermal and mechanical properties, wettability, and electrical conductivity [6]. our daily life encounters different sensors such as temperature (e.g., ir (infrared sensors)) [7], proximity (e.g., touch sensors, position sensors) [8–10], motion (e.g., accelerometer sensors, rotation position sensors) [11,12], light [13,14], ultrasonic [15], heat [16], force/ pressure [17], humidity [18,19], sound [20], pir [21,22], strain and weight [23,24], electric current [25], magnetic [26], gas and smoke [27,28] etc. and a myriad of other uses are shown in (fig. 1) [29,30]. furthermore, sensors and artificial intelligence (ai) can instantly alert physicians and patient visitors when they fail to sanitize their hands before entering the hospital room. ai tools can be built into smart homes, and technology can covertly monitor frail elderly for behavioral cues of an impending health crisis [31]. volatile organic compounds (vocs) are a kind of primary pollutants and highly reactive organic compounds [32]. vocs are compounds with high vapor pressure and low water solubility. many vocs are man-made chemicals used and manufactured in refrigerants, pharmaceuticals, and paints. certain vocs are suspected or proven carcinogens [33]. it is released as a gas from particular liquids or solids [34]. for example, commonly vocs may be used in our daily life such as 1,3-butadiene [c4h6], formaldehyde [ch2o], benzene [c6h6], ethylene glycol [c2h6o2], toluene [c7h8], dichloromethane (dcm) [ch2cl2], xylene [c8h10], and tetrachloroethylene [c2cl4] [35,36]. vocs contain a range of chemicals, some of which may have long- and short-term adverse health effects. the concentration of many vocs is typically ten (10) times higher indoors than outdoors [37]. vocs can cause serious health problems in humans when absorbed or inhaled through the skin. exhaust streams, aerosols, and solvents employed in unventilated areas can produce dangerous toxins [38]. humans may experience dizziness, memory loss, headaches, and visual disturbances if exposed to large amounts. exposure to high-level vocs may cause a variety of health effects, including throat discomfort, and nose and eye irritation [39]. some compounds can cause even cancer in animals, as well as some suspected, are cause to cancer in humans. also, vocs damage the kidneys, liver, or central nervous system and nausea, dyspnea, loss of coordination, allergic skin reaction, conjunctival irritation, headache, and declines in serum cholinesterase levels, and emesis [39,40]. volatile organic compounds (vocs) are responsible for scent odors and perfume odors, as well as pollutants [41]. vocs play an important role in the formation of ground-level ozone (o3) and fine particles in the atmosphere. under sunlight, vocs react primarily with nitrogen oxides (nox) emitted from vehicles, power plants, and industrial activities to create ozone (o3), which in turn contributes to the formation of fine particles [42]. moreover, vocs also actively participated in the communication between plants and animals, such as attractants for preventing predation, pollinators, and even interactions between plants [43]. the sensors can give remarkable signals with low energy consumption and offer excellent performance with even simple device configurations [44,45]. conductivity change is the most frequently used property in a polypyrrole (ppy)-based sensors. it has been reported that conductivity enhancement is observed in the reason of ppy-based sensors towards the detection of carbon monoxide (co) [46], carbon dioxide (co2) [47], nitrogen dioxide (no2) [48,49], hydrogen (h2) [50], hydrogen chloride (hcl) [51,52], hydrogen sulfide (h2s) [53], 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid/ ethanoic acid (c8h6cl2o3) [54]. in contrast, the conductivity reduction of the nh3 analyte has been reported. in the case of dimethyl methyl phosphonate (dmmp) fig. 1. the average power consumption of various types of sensors [29,30]. m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 3 [c3h9o3p]-based sensors also work on conductivity enhancement against common analyte gases. however, the trend is more complicated in the case of ppy which is increased and enhancement also reduction in conductivity reported against nh3 and h2s analytes [55,56]. ppy has a good conductivity for different analysts as nh3, no2, h2s, h2, co, co2, hcl, ch3cooh, and dimethyl methyl phosphonate (dmmp) at room temperature [57–62]. therefore, the situation of ppy depends on the specific reason and step-by-step basis (table 1). all the mechanisms mentioned in table 1 can be considered as ppy sensing mechanisms. the ppy sensors demonstrate excellent performance in terms of selectivity, good stability, reproducibility, and immunity to humidity. ppy has shown good conductivity (experimental 2000 s.cm-1 and theoretical 7600 s.cm-1) chrematistics in comparison with the other polymers such as polythiophene (pth) (experimental 100 s.cm-1 and theoretical 169 s. cm-1) according to table 2 [65]. it also shows a high, fast, and opposite reaction. these sensors facilitate meeting the specifications of the actual practical applications [60]. ppy has received much attention or use in the fabrication of gas sensors [66-69]. it is due to their reasonable excellent mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and low cost. from the literature survey, we have observed that in the case of nh3 molecules conductivity increases [60]; no2 molecule’s conductivity increases [61]; h2s, h2, co, co2, hcl, ch3cooh molecule’s conductivity increases [57–59]; all of these make them the chemical sensors use by ppy for exploring gas sensing applications. in the following, we will be discussing the use of ppy to detect toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (co) [70], hydrogen sulfide (h2s) [57], and carbon dioxide (co2) [71], and vocs (e.g., methanol [ch3oh], ethanol [c2h5oh], chloroform [chcl3], toluene [c7h8], and n-hexane [c6h14]), as shown in (table 3) [72–79]. one of the famous vocs is methanol. it is a toxic gas, with a variety of use in industry, as a solvent, in the synthesis of other organic chemicals, as an additive to gasoline, etc. many sensing materials such as oxide semiconductors, nano-thin films, electronic conductometry, and direct spectroscopic techniques have been explored earlier for the detection of methanol. some ppy, are also reported as potential materials for sensing methanol vapor. the monomer and polymerized form of the ppy are shown in (fig. 2). the effects of side-chain lengths on sensing features and characteristics of ppy are also duly pointed out, and their emerging application for gas sensing is presented. this review includes focuses on complementary aspects of both theory and experiments on ppy-based sensors. the systematic exposition of doping, surface modification chain selection, and ppy-chainarrangements is also new. in addition, the tables and discussions given herein on all reported families of conducting polymers (cps) and their current utilities will help a wide spectrum of researchers. furthermore, the gaps identified will enable the further activity of volatile organic compounds (vocs). in summary, we come up with the idea of writing a new review in this field because researchers face many challenges when working with ppy-based sensors. in addition, when we read and watch research articles, we need to remember important points and find out the research gaps. that’s why the information in this review is most important, as it contains all current research related to these regions and is used to gather new knowledge and skills about different sensors like gas sensors, flexible sensors, electrochemical sensors, optical sensors, etc. using ppy. moreover, the aim of this review is to create readability and to fill the knowledge gap in the best resources available in the literature. furthermore, this review paper is needed to clarify the state of knowledge, determine the necessity of research, explain the obvious contradictions, and even reach a consensus in places that did not even exist before. therefore, this review will be helpful for all researchers working in this field. 2. synthesis and recent modification strategies of ppy ppy was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization technique using pyrrole monomer (c4h4nh) in an aqueous solution for 4 h at room temperature [80]. after synthesis, ppy is very difficult to process because it is non-thermoplastic, brittle, rigid, non-degradable, and insoluble in common solvents. it is an oxidized form of a positively charged p-type conducting polymer that loses conductivity and becomes charged when over-oxidized [81]. it has low mechanical strength and is insulating in its neutral state. however, we found from the literature survey that the ppy-modified electrode enhanced the electron transport efficiency, thus enhancing the electron utilization efficiency of microorganisms, thereby improving the denitrification performance of the system [82]. in addition, we also found from literature surveys, ft-ir spectroscopy, and elemental analysis that it is proportional to the solubility of the precursor polymers in organic solvents. in this case, the ppy(so3h)-dehs powder has shown maximum solubility in water (~4% (w/v)) and a film conductivity of ~5 × 10–1 s/cm [83]. the surface changes of ppy result in improving gas sensitivity [84]. surface modification is generally divided into two categories: physical and chemical [85]. so far, wet chemical treatments [86] and organo-silanization [87] approaches have been used for surface modification of ppy. besides, carbon-doped ppy has been reported wherein electronic properties are well-tuned, which in turn leads to enhanced gas sensitivity. specifically, carbon doping increases the electron mass transfer from the valence to the conduction band [88]. the phenomenon results in efficient electronic interaction between the conductive surface and target molecules of a desirable sensitivity [89]. ppy is also suitable for sensing nh3 analytes [90], hence it is employed in gas sensors for detection of the same. the interaction between ppy and gas analyte can be rather strong even at room temperature (this is unlike the case for sensors made of oxide semiconductors) [91]. 3. role of ppy sensitivity towards inorganic gases and vocs it has been continuously reported that some ppy demonstrates good sensing performance for the detection of vocs. moreover, these ppy has shown lower detection limits and proper working competence under ambient conditions which is mainly due to their conductivity nature. ppy-based sensors are sensitive to gas molecules such as acetone, alcohol, benzene, toluene, and many biological species [92]. however, both the sensitivity and selectivity of ppy to analytes vary significantly with the environment [93,94]. among the various cps, ppy is intrinsically better for the detection of vocs, due to its superior electronic and ionic conductivity and also its chemical steadiness. doping ppy with relevant secondary elements can enhance its sensitivity toward vocs detection [95]. furthermore, it has been shown that the performances of ppy are often hampered by atmospheric moisture. for example, it is reported that ppy’s sensitivity towards co and vocs decreases by a certain percentage (40%, 60%, or 80%) with an increase in the moisture concentration (4–70%) [96,97]. this suggests that the sensitivity of ppy-based sensors depends on environmental factors, including humidity, temperature, and incident light [98]. the ppy and its composites are found to be better sensing materials for some vocs for example methanol [99], chloroform [100], and ammonia [101,102]. the density-functional theory (dft) is a computational quantum-mechanical (qm) modeling approach used in the area table 1 some polymers have been employed before for gas (including voc) sensors. mechanisms polymers analysts

calculate the electronic or nuclear structure (mainly the ground state) of multi-body systems, especially atoms, molecules, and solids [103]. dft and time-dependent dft (td-dft) calculations are used to study the doping and undoping processes of ppy, i.e., the tunable nature of ppy. jayasundara et al. have reported that in the case of npy, p-doping leads to increased conductivity, but decreased bandgap and resistance. whereas in the case of npy+27 the reverse trend is observed in terms of n-doping or reduction [104]. in the following section we will be discussing the ppy for no2 detection; ppy for co and co2 detection; and ppy for vocs detection. 3.1. role of ppy for no2 detection in general, nitrogen dioxide (no2) poisoning is harmful to all kinds of life, such as chlorine gas poisoning and carbon monoxide (co) poisoning. it is easily absorbed by the lungs and its inhalation can cause heart failure and sometimes death in severe cases [104]. also, nitrogen oxides (no2, n2o3, n2o4, and n2o5) can irritate the upper respiratory tract and lungs even at low concentrations. just one or two breaths of very high concentrations can cause severe toxicity. for acute exposure, the odor is usually a sufficient precautionary property [105]. finally, ppy is important to many industries because it can detect nitrogen dioxide (no2) accurately and quickly to avoid the gas reaching dangerously toxic levels. ppy sensing films exhibit highly selective and sensitive detection of no2 at ppm level. ppy-based sensors show good reproducibility (99%) and 55% stability [106,107]. recently, it has been reported that ppy-based sensors can be used to detect no2. it is found that ppy exhibits appreciable sensitivity towards no2 gas [108]. also, ppy-based sensors for no2 detection have offered the advantages of high sensitivity, selectivity, short recovery time, cost viability, and low detection limit. these are achieved due to various morphologies of ppy [109]. in particular, mesoporous films of ppy are found to be helpful [110,111]. 3.2. role of ppy for co and co2 detection carbon monoxide (co) is a chemical compound that contains one carbon atom and one oxygen atom and

in our atmosphere. without it, our planet would be incredibly cold [114]. it is important to install co alarms on every floor of your home so that all family members can hear the detectors and receive emergency alerts. you should also install co detectors in every bedroom, sleeping area, and common room to provide extra safety while you and your family are sleeping [115]. however, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (co2) in our atmosphere have caused average global temperatures to rise, disrupting other aspects of the earth’s climate [116]. in addition, the detection of the two gases is different because co2 detectors typically use infrared sensors, while co identification uses electrochemical sensors. however, co can also be detected using non-dispersive infrared (ndir) sensing [117]. furthermore, depending on the availability of oxygen (o), the combustion reaction can produce both carbon monoxide (co) and carbon dioxide (co2). inhaled carbon monoxide (co) competes with oxygen (o) for binding to hemoglobin, depriving the organs of oxygen, which can lead to death [118]. the ppy offers advantages such as fast response, cost viability, and low power requirements during co detection. in fact, miniature co gas sensor devices have been realized [119]. however, the technique employed for the fabrication of devices has an essential role. for instance, techniques that give rise to stable ppy and protect the physicochemical properties (charge transport, morphology, surface area, and porosity) of the ppy are considered to be advantageous for co detection [120]. according to the literature survey, we have found ppy is not a good sensor for co, while it is a good one for voc. 3.3. role of ppy for vocs capturing in this review, we discuss different aspects of gas sensors and vocs sensors, which are made employing conducting polymers such as ppy, polyaniline (pani), poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (pedot), and polythiophene (pth), as well as their heterogeneous species with metals, metal oxide nanostructures and nanocarbons (carbon nanotubes (cnts), reduced graphene oxide (rgo)), are used as active layers [121–123]. the ppy exhibits better sensitivity to ethanol when compared with the doped thin film sensors. its response and stability were previously studied [124]. among conducting polymers, ppy has been widely reported for the detection of volatile organic compounds (vocs). commercially, voc sensors find use in photo-ionized detectors (pid), electronic noses, and sensor arrays [125]. besides, ppy has been shown to have high sensitivity to ethanol [c2h5oh], acetone [c3h6o], isoprene [c5h8], and isopropanol [c3h8o] at room temperature. ppy thus has several desirable characteristics relevant to the detection of different kinds of vocs [126]. the cdte/ppy nanocomposites were synthesized and integrated into love wave (l saw) sensors and exhibit high sensitivity to acetone with an estimated lod of 5 ppb. for increased sensitivity is related to the adsorption of acetone on ppy through dipole-dipole interactions and the incorporation of cdte into the indicator /sensitive l saw layer enhances sensor performance [127]. polyaniline (pani) is a highly conductive polymer. due to its unique properties, easy synthesis, low cost, and high environmental stability, it has reached widespread attention in various applications such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and anti-corrosion materials [128]. the electrical conductivity of pani-based compositions can be tightly controlled over a wide range. for pure pani compositions, conductivity levels up to 100 s/cm can be achieved. for polymer blends comprising pani compositions, a full range of conductivity levels from less than 10–10–10–1 s/cm (melt processing) and 10 s/cm (solution processing) can be achieved [129]. an important advantage is that the classical high permeation threshold for the onset of conductivity observed in spherical carbon black-filled plastics does not exist [130]. plasticized pani compositions improve the efficiency of molten processing by reducing melting-viscosity, lowering the processing temperature, and shortening the processing time. improved molten flow features and characteristics make complex-shaped injection molding easier [131]. similarly, the conducting polymers (e.g., ppy and pani) have been fabricated for the detection of vocs. ppy and pani thin sensors have achieved higher sensitivity compared to thick ones owing to 1-minute undoped. ppy exhibited positive sensitivity while pani has negative sensitivity. after gas absorption, the sensitivity increases with the polarity of the absorbing molecules [132]. it has also been found that the cp sensor was very sensitive to the polarity of gas molecules. nevertheless, nearly all types of cps show similar sensing mechanisms in the detection of voc gases wherein bipolar on or free carrier moves and localizes on their surface [133] due to the adsorption of the gases. voc sensors have been found for use in healthcare (e.g., asthma, cancer), safety, environmental monitoring, food and agriculture (e.g., affecting ecosystem & plant growth development), and the oil industry. moreover, vocs appear to detect hybrid nanomaterials with desired properties such as limit of detection, superior sensitivity, synergist effects, and developed performance of voc sensors, as shown in (fig. 3) [134, 135]. this is known to cause a change in the resistance to indicate gas detection. we have found from the literature survey, ppy is better than poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (pedot). the alcohol sensing behaviors of pedot and ppy nanostructures for methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol are investigated, and the sensing mechanisms of these systems are discussed [136]. both the pedot and ppy systems are able to detect very low alcohol concentrations (down to 3 ppm) and exhibit linear behavior with fast response/recovery performance, especially in the case of ethanol vapor [137]. compared to pedot, the ppy-based sensors showed better cyclability in response to pedot when exposed to an ethanol atmosphere. the surface properties of pedot and ppy-sensitive layers were investigated by atomic force microscopy. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was used to study the effects of alcohol exposure on the electrical transport properties of nanostructured pedot and ppy layers [138]. when comparing the sensitivity of them and have been controlled temperature. frequently, ppy shows better sensitivity when compared to pedot-based sensors, as shown in (table 4). in short, we have summarized data of ppy-based voc sensors with sensitivity, detection range, and limit of detection (lod) and compared them with other micro/nano-materials [139–148], as shown in (table 5). 4. computational studies on gas sensing mechanisms of ppy theoretical calculations, especially density functional theory (dft) approaches, have been a useful approach to identifying the physical properties, sensing characteristics, and molecular charge of polymers, especially ppy [149-153]. dft models allow the determination of charge transfer and complex formation when ppy interfaces with gas analytes. these calculations have shown that the electronic structure of ppy offers excellent gas sensors for the detection of co2, so2, co, h2o, nh3, and ch4. they were considered to enhance gas sensitivity along with selectivity by using the b3lyp/ 6–31 g(d) level of theory [154]. computational approaches such as quantum espresso (qe) and vienna ab initio simulation package (vasp) are widely used to study the structural properties, electronic structures, and sensing mechanisms of ppy with good results [155,156]. there are many examples of studying sensing mechanisms using qe and vasp for ppy. ullah et al. have studied theoretically the ppy as a sensor for ammonia through dft methods at the theoretical level of tdb3lyp/6–31 g(d) and b3lyp/6–31 g(d) techniques [155]. they evaluated and calculated the geometric and electronic properties of the polymer (ppy) extrapolated with nh3, also justifying the ammonia sensation by ppy [155]. moreover, coleone, a. p., et al. improved the electronic and optical properties of ppy by employing the dft/m06hf/6–31 g(d) approach [156]. the results also pointed out that ppy-no2 is a promising component for m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 6 exciton dissociation and charge transport. it had been proven that ppy-oh and ppy-och3 can be the most attractive components for optical applications with redshifts of more than 20 nm compared to unchanged ppy [156]. in this signification, the design of components with electronic, reactivity, and optical properties of ppy can be improved by considering the simple hammett parameters [156]. theoretical studies have also been used to investigate the ability of ppy salt for ppy sensing nh3, co2, and co analytes investigated through dft calculations at the theoretical level by b3lyp-d3/6–31++g (d, p) [157,158]. the results showed better selectivity and sensitivity for ammonia compared to co2 and co gas [159]. for example, ppy’s sensitivity towards nh3 decreases by a certain percentage of (50%, 70%, or 90%) with an increase in the moisture concentration (4–75%) [157, 158]. moreover, ullah, h. et al. reported ppy as a sensing mechanism for nh3 gas [155]. they have shown that interaction with ammonia would result in lower resistance for election movements over the oligomer backbone which is due to the reduction of undoped ppy (fig. 4). wasim et al. employed the theoretical level of b3lyp-cp/6–31 g(d) and evaluated the sensing power of ppy for the oxygen, nitrogen, and oxynitrogen analytes ppy-x (x = no, no2, and no2 - ) [159]. the charge transfer from the analyte to the pyrrole oligomers (excluding npy-no2) was more pronounced in the case of nitrite ions (no2 - ) compared to no. it should be considered that ppy is the best conducting polymer (cp) for the detection of nitrite anion (no2􀀀 ) and nh3 at room temperature [154, 159]. 5. theoretical analysis of ppy gas sensors the ppy has been investigated employing the density functional theory (dft), and atoms are also simulated using the super-soft pseudopotential approach [160]. mercury (hg2+) pollution poses significant risks to the environment and human health, even in low concentrations [161]. it can lead to severe organ damage such as different motor diseases and kidney failure cases. among these, the high-performance electrochemistry sensor was designed for detecting hg2+ and the sensor features were greatly improved, which originally came from the schottky barrier of the cuo/cu/ppy electrode [162]. benefiting from the physical barrier, cuo/cu/ppy electrode was a redistribution of charge and high hg2+ adsorption power, which was proved experimentally and theoretically. theoretical analysis of the mulliken charge fig. 3. sensing mechanisms of voc sensors with promising directions [134,135]. table 4 comparing the sensitivity of conducting polymer for capturing applications on literature

347 (2022) 113933 7 indicates that the gaps between the schottky barrier [163] and the charge concentration of ppy became larger with the synthesis of hg2+ [164], which accelerated the reaction velocity and was more favorable for hg2+ [162]. experimental and theoretical results suggest that introducing a physical barrier to electrochemical metoprolol sensors was an effective way to develop novel sensors [163]. nezhadali et al. have developed electrochemical sensor selective and sensitive detection by employing dft computational approach. the sensitivity has been increased by increasing the conductivity. the sensors are studied by using the multivariate optimization method to deeply study the parameters that affect the imprinting effect. this sensor has shown a good imprinting effect and satisfactory sensing performance through sample analysis [163]. zhuang, y., et al. have confirmed the experimental and dft results indicated that introducing a physical barrier to electrochemistry sensors was an effective means for the development of novel sensors and the excellent sensing performance was analyzed. due to the physical barrier playing a crucial role in electrochemical detection, the sensor can work in seawater [160]. with the increase in hg2+ adsorption, the charge density gap between the schottky barrier and the concentration of ppy charge became wider which accelerated the response dynamics and was more favorable to hg2+ while the sensitive performance was an improvement. ppy film and cuo/cu worked together in the presence of hg2+ with low features such as low detection range, good selection, and strong anti-interference efficiency. aids to calculation system counting system for different numbers of hg2+ adsorbs on cuo/cu/ppy surface using dft method. in this study, they compared adsorption energy (ev) and reaction coordinate of cuo/cu/ppy with hg2+ and the results were + 1 hg2+ (􀀀 1.07 ev), and + 2 hg2+ (􀀀 1.69 ev) shown in fig. 5 [160]. in summary, complementary dft and experimental results can be used to tailor the electronic structure of ppy gas sensing materials [154, 164]. dft tools can be used to select a suitable gas sensing material or even identify the right dopants to enhance selectivity towards target molecules (both organic and inorganic). table 5 the ppy-based voc sensors: sensitivity, detection range, and limit of detection

actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 8 6. experimental analysis: insights for improving ppy gas sensor’s performance the performance of the ppy mainly depends on the conductivity. from a practical standpoint, sensitivity, selectivity, and operation at room temperature are key parameters. ppy is a p-type semiconductor (resistive gas sensors) and has been evaluated on a lab scale along with these performance parameters [165]. lab-scale investigations have also shown that ppy chains can be formed for enhancing gas sensitivity and charge exchange [166]. thus, a combination of strategies including doping, surface functionalization, and chain formation- is all shown to have relevance in gas detection. in the formation of ppy chains, of particular importance is the role of hydrogen bonds, π–π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. these also improve the mechanical properties for enhancing material stability [167]. furthermore, the conjugated bonds in the ppy can be easily manipulated through doping. specifically, the bond can be reduced (i.e., via n-type doped) or oxidized (via p-type doped). from studies thus far, however, it is clear that doping engineering is important for improving the gas sensing performance with ppy (fig. 6). in this section, we will be discussing the types of gases that can be detected by a particular ppy. the ppy polymer usually shows gassensing properties in an oxidized state. the preparation of ppy can be fig. 5. aids counting system for different numbers of hg2+ adsorbs on cuo/ cu/ppy surface using dft method [152] copyright©

et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 9 done through electrochemical polymerization [168,169]. the easy oxidation reactions and low-cost processing of ppy make it an outstanding polymer when compared to other cps in the gas sensor field. moreover, ppy has been applied in different kinds of gas sensors which include bio-sensors, bio-actuators, neural electrodes, and drug delivery [170]. for instance, sajid, h., et al. have reported the sensitivity of ppy towards co, nh3, vocs, and co2 [171,172]. in general, it is discovered that ppy has better sensitivity toward ammonia (nh3) and vocs than other gases [173], as shown in (table 6). computational studies show that ppy forms both doped (ppy+) and undoped (ppy) states; both of which are shown to be good candidates for toxic gas detection (e.g., co, nh3, co2, etc.) [173]. nonetheless, the doped and undoped states of ppy are more sensitive to nh3 gas when compared to co and co2 gases. furthermore, the doped form often shows excellent sensitivity towards nh3 gas when compared to undoped ones, for example upon ethanol gas. 7. application of ppy in capturing recently, ppy has drawn significant attention to the improvement of different types of sensors [174-178]. this is due to the transduction possible using ppy to yield chemical, biochemical, electrical, optical, thermal, or mechanical signals [179]. gas sensors are finding applications in diverse technologies ranging from chemo-resistive sensors, biosensors, micro-electromechanical systems, coatings, and textiles of emerging developments. they have also found use in various sectors such as biomedicine, healthcare, environmental monitoring, etc. there is already substantial research on deploying ppy for real-world applications (including in areas associated with flexible electronics) [180]. nano-sensors have enabled improvements that are otherwise not achievable via conventional sensors, for instance, sensitivity, accuracy, and faster response- have all been possible using ppy-based sensors [181]. in general, ppy is a conductive polymer that has demonstrated sensitivity to various gases and organic vapors (e.g., acetone, ammonia, and ethanol) [173]. methanol and water vapor in the ppy sensors were identified as multiple gases, and the methanol and water vapor absorption competed on the surface of the sensor. the sensitivity increases at low temperatures and low humidity. fast response and recovery times are shown at 25 ◦c. the reproducibility of the ppy under different humidity conditions is good. the optimum operating temperature was studied at 25 ◦c [182]. the carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) was fast detected and sensitive when fabricated a flexible pressure sensor using three-dimensional (3d) ppy foam [183]. ppy was integrated into chemi-resistive sensors and up-to-date, the use of ppy in saw sensors has been found from the literature survey. examples of these include rayleigh wave-based saw sensors for the detection of acetone, ammonia, h2s, and no2, or shear level saw for hydrogen detection (e. g., leaky). based on published research, we have found that the use of ppy in l-saw sensors is less common. however, our modern elementary results suggest the possibility of detecting low concentrations of ammonia in ppy-based l-saw sensors [184]. 7.1. chemical and gas sensors the current research work demonstrates that ppy-based sensors were fabricated through surfactant-assisted doping. the resulting instrument was explored and implemented as an effective gas sensor for vocs and some toxic gases at low ppm levels. ppy nanostructures were produced through the polymerization of chemical oxidative employing different sulfonic acids as surfactants at temperatures of 0–5 ◦c [185]. the doping of sulfonic acid has a high impact on the morphology of ppy compounds, which exhibit compact structures such as amorphous, globular, cauliflower, flakes, and sheets based on surface morphology. the role of the sulfonyl group in ppy has been confirmed through ft-ir spectroscopic analysis. the conductivity of doped ppy was sequentially and gradually increased, and the amount of surfactant added was increased from 0.1 to 2.0 m, depending on the level of doping with concern to the dopant nature. real studies and doped ppy gas sensors were investigated at various ppm levels for different gases. the sensing process following the reaction system between the gas and the sensor material under study has been extensively discussed. the early ppy had 70% and 93% responses to nh3 and cl2 gases, respectively, while the doped ppy had an increased response to most of the vocs and toxic gases under experimental research and studies. extensive studies of the different sensing properties and higher sensitization results of these components demonstrate that surfactant-doped ppy materials have appeared as effective gas sensors with excellent response, repeatability, and retrieval at a minimum of 5 ppm levels [185]. 7.2. the fabric-based chemical gas sensors textile-integrated gas sensors for health or environmental monitoring applications need to be combined with gas sensors integrated into wearable devices. however, the behavior of sensing devices with electro-conductive textile substrates can be highly environmental and aging-dependent [186]. nevertheless, sensors are employed to detect toxic gases/vocs. it showed the full functionality of the image after weaving in different sensing modes and correct sensory responses (fig. 7) [187]. 7.3. graphene-based sensors graphene-based materials have contributed to the development of sensitive sensors and biosensors due to their physical and electrochemical features. the most important features of graphene-based are flexible and stretchable for multi-functionality sensing devices and the major advances in sensor technologies (e.g., gas sensors, cancer biomarker detection, flow sensors, strain sensors, etc.) [188]. moreover, the graphene-based sensors also improve the analytical performance for application in environmental, clinical, and food science, etc., [189]. in addition, the development of graphene-based flexible gas and chemical sensors is reviewed in the preparation of materials, the manufacture of sensors, and their effectiveness. the overview of graphene-based materials and their potential applications in flexible and stretchable wearable electronic devices. herein, mention that singh, eric, et al., are briefly discussed the application of flexible gas sensors for the detection of various hazardous gases including nitrogen dioxide (no2), ammonia (nh3), hydrogen (h2), hydrogen sulfide (h2s), carbon dioxide (co2), sulfur dioxide (so2) and humidity [188]. also, applications of graphene-based materials are also shortened to detect toxic heavy metal ions (cd, hg, pb, cr, fe, ni, co, cu, ag) and volatile organic compounds (vocs) including nitrobenzene, toluene, acetone, formaldehyde, amines, phenols, bisphenol a (bpa), explosives, chemical warfare agents and environmental pollutants [188]. 7.4. nanocomposite-based sensors ppy nanocomposite-based sensors are developed for potential table 6 the sensing material for toxic gases and vocs were observed from various research works of literature.

ppy nanocomposite-based sensors are being improved that enjoy sensitivity, selectivity, rigidity, and real-time measurement. these sensor platforms are helped to create new technologies to ensure environmental and human protection [191]. recently, researchers have made considerable efforts to use ppy nanocomposites to create ppy nanocomposite-based sensors in terms of their promising properties, such as better electrolytic activity, higher electrical conductivity, and effective surface area in comparison to conventional polymers [192]. therefore, relative to their bulk counterparts, nanocomposite-based sensors exhibit unique features and provide the basis for the use of various types of sensors (e.g., gas and chemical, electrochemical and fluorescent, stretchable and bendable strain, as well as tensile strain, etc.) are used to detect drugs and biomolecules as well as many new possibilities [193]. 7.5. graphene-based nanocomposites biosensors ppy nanostructures (e.g., graphene, cnt, metal oxides, metal nanoparticle, metal sulfides, etc.) are discussed in the ppy matrix for developed gas sensing performance [194]. the detailed and systematic discussions on synthesis techniques, gas sensing principles of ppy nanostructures, and its composites with the development of sensor device configurations provide the reader with an in-depth understanding of the above [195]. moreover, the progress of graphene-based nanocomposite biosensors with a wide range of advanced sensitivities, selectivity, and detection for an emerging application. also, the biological function of graphene-based materials and the process of nanocomposite formation and their unique features, surface function, enzyme destabilization techniques, covalent stabilization, physical absorption, and bio-interactions processes with biosensors are studies including good understanding [196]. 7.6. electrochemical sensors the most widely used ppy is a conducting polymer in the design of a bioanalytical sensor. recent advances and issues in the improvement of molecularly printed ppy are considered [197]. the electrochemical sensors have appeared as tools for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) detection due to their cost-effectiveness, easy of fabrication and usage, high sensitivity and selectivity, and better reproducibility [198]. ppy is easily prepared through the polymerization technique and pyrrole is a chemical species, as well as stable semi-conductive polymer components solved by electrochemical methods under conditions of mild synthesis. the ppy is used as a stable molecular structure in which the imprint of the desired pahs is localized in situ; can be fabricated on glassy carbon electrodes [198]. 7.7. optical sensors qin et al., and azzouz et al., have applied ppy to detect volatile organic compounds (vocs), and other sensors like optical, capacitive, and impedance sensors, as shown in table7, use ppy and other materials for various gases and vocs sensors [199–205], through a fiber optic reflection sensor (fors) [206,207]. the traditional interfacial polymerization approach was employed to synthesize sensitive ppy membranes, with higher reflection and lower roughness. the electrical properties of conducting polymers like ppy have changed in the exploration of sensing materials, but their optical properties are rarely explored. moreover, the reflected optical signal also changed from ppy after systematically evaluating the interaction with vocs. qin et al., and ˇsetka et al., have fabricated and exhibited high sensitivity of the ppy in vocs under fors testing with a detection limit of up to 1 ppm [139, 206]. 8. challenges and future prospects polymeric materials such as ppy and their derivatives are manufactured for the following applications: solving medical diagnostics problems, pharmaceutical supply, drug delivery, biomedical products, biotechnology, adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives, coatings, waterborne coatings, re-dispersible lattices, electronics, magnetics, fig. 7. smart textiles-based gas accumulation for health applications; [179]. copyright© 2016 woodhead publishing. m.r. miah et al. sensors and actuators: a. physical 347 (2022) 113933 11 optoelectronics, etc., are expected to become the general technologies investigated in these research fields. novel sensors and biosensors will explore a variety of construction techniques that use ppy as a sensing component, which can be used to detect small organic, biological, and inorganic, molecular dna. moreover, it can also be used to fabricate heteroatom-doped ppy novel biosensors, and ppy will be furthermore research carried out. the biocompatibility of ppy in various sensing applications needs to be desired furthermore research works in the future. in addition to the large-scale production of monolayer ppy is a big challenge to overcome in near future. the current achievement of polymer materials is the use of polymer nanoparticle drug carriers for combination therapy to treat cancer. ppy nanomaterials are expected to significantly alter combination therapy for cancer treatment by regulating the type of deposit and distribution of multiple drugs at disease sites. therefore, ppy composite materials will also become an important player in the fields of electronic devices and modern medicine. ppy has several desirable properties that include reasonable chemical stability, mechanical flexibility, and eco-friendliness. these make them promising candidates for upcoming technologies wherein gas sensors are required for a wide range of analytes. here, we discuss doping, surface modification, and ppy chain arrangements as important ways to enhance the gas sensing performance of sensors. using insights from both experimental and ab initio studies, we show the current mode of rationalizing or even designing the sensing substrate for a given analyte. we also discuss the most common ppy and its current utilities, from the standpoint of gas sensing. we further identify gaps in the state of the art- both from fundamental and applied standpoints. given the content and scope of this review, we expect this work to spur further work on the use of ppy for the fabrication of gas sensors and associated devices. over the past few decades, numerous sensitive approaches for the detection of nh3 gas have been extensively studied to address environmental and public health concerns. among the commonly used nh3 gas sensing approaches include solid-state sensing techniques, as well as metal oxides and ppy-based sensors handling. in particular, metal oxidebased nh3 gas sensors have been deeply investigated and widely used due to their high internal sensitivity to nh3 gas. however, much effort is still needed to further improve the selectivity of nh3 gas. furthermore, most of the metal oxide-based nh3 gas sensors demand relatively high temperatures, which cannot guarantee real-time detection, portability, and energy-efficient operation [208]. in particular, carbon nanotubes (cnts) or layered graphene are used to lower the operating temperature due to their higher electrical mobility, which can greatly improve the general smoothness of metal oxides recovery rate. but in terms of room temperature activity, the low growth rate of the analytical gas at room temperature and the high absorption energy between the analytical gas molecules still need to be developed. and the rapid recovery of the active part of the sensitive substance quickly returns to its initial state. therefore, future research on metal oxide-based nh3 gas sensors should focus on enhanced selectivity, sensitivity, and room temperature operations. like metal oxide-based nh3 gas sensors, polymer-based nh3 gas sensors are also less selective when implementing polymer sensing layers due to moisture and swelling effects. in fact, the humidity and expansion effects in the air are only a slight defect, for the main defect is caused by long-term instability and irreversibility. although the process of immutability is not clearly explained in the literature, it is mainly attributed to the nucleophilic invasion of the carbon backbone [209]. in addition, long-term stability is rarely found due to camouflage in polymer handling. therefore, in contrast to operating ppy-based nh3 gas sensors and improving long-term stability may be the direction of future research. typically, tdls requires complex sensing system configurations in order to meet a high degree of sensitivity and finality, resulting in high system construction costs. furthermore, complex system configurations may hinder device miniaturization [210,211]. 9. conclusions to conclude, although many past studies have focused on developing a single sensing approach for ppy-based sensors the latest and most advanced sensing technologies are used for the detection of hybrid sensing materials or a mix of sensitive materials. in addition, the field of fancy hybridization is rapidly expanding to sensitive substances or detection techniques to accurately measure volatile organic compounds (vocs) detection. furthermore, since conclusiveness is a most challenging goal for almost all kinds of ppy-based sensors, future experimental research work is also making efforts to improve the selectivity of hybrid ppy-based sensing methods are also required. with the rapid development of accumulation devices such as chemical and gas sensors, table 7 the
