[5]; y.wang and h. zhou [6]), the impact of population aging on residents’ consumption is dynamic (y. aksoy et al. [7]; x. zang and x. li [8]; p. liu et al. [9]; h. jin and y. li [10]), and the effect of population aging on residents’ consumption is not significant (w. li et al. [11]; k. li et al. [12]). some scholars study the influencing factors of consumption. for example, x. zhao and l. li [13] found that the education level of the household head and the number of children in the family positively impact consumption and significantly impact low-income households. the age of the household head, the health status of the household head, and the household size have a sig- vol.26 no.4, 2022 journal of advanced computational intelligence and intelligent informatics 631 © fuji technology press ltd. creative commons cc by-nd: this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noderivatives 4.0 internationallicense (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) chen, l. and zhao, x. nificant impact on household consumption. f. wang and l. huang [14] found that family characteristics are significantly related to family consumption choices, and the family characteristics possessed by residents have obvious consumption preferences. l. sheng et al. [15] found that population aging negatively impacts average household consumption, and urbanization and residents’ education level significantly positively impact the average household consumption rate. through the research literature, it can be found that scholars have obtained many important and enlightening conclusions based on the research of macro or micro data. few studies examine the internal changes in household consumption structure at the micro level. the scant literature focusing on this aspect mainly select provincial-level data. examining the impact of population aging on household consumption from the micro level will help us grasp the general direction of household consumption structure changes and suggest improving consumption structure and optimizing consumption upgrades. thus, this study analyzes the mechanism’s relationship between population aging and consumption structure. moreover, it conducts an empirical test based on the data of china family panel studies (cfps2016). 2. analysis of theoretical mechanism due to differences in consumption quantity, consumption habits, and consumption structure of different age groups (r. mao and j. xu [1]), the impact of population aging on household consumption can be summed up as follows: (1) basic living expenses, which include food, clothing, housing, and transportation expenses: the consumption habits and consumption patterns of different age groups are quite different. accordingly, with the population aging, the household consumption structure will also change. in terms of food, on the one hand, the elderly tend to have lighter tastes, which reduces food consumption expenditure. on the other hand, the elderly stay longer at home, hence the number of meals at home also increases, which increases food consumption. in terms of clothing, the elderly prefer simplicity, and the elderly are retired and unemployed at home, reducing the requirements for dress. therefore, as the population ages, clothing consumption will gradually decrease. regarding housing, the elderly usually purchase a house when they are young and middle-aged and generally have to pay off their mortgage before retirement, thus significantly reducing housing consumption. in terms of transportation and communication, on the one hand, the physical quality of the elderly declines and the scope of activities is reduced; on the other hand, after retirement, the social life circle becomes narrower, so the consumption of transportation and communication will also decrease. (2) cultural and educational entertainment: with the continuous development of the social economy and the continuous improvement of people’s living standards, residents’ consumption has become more diversified. gradually, basic living consumption can no longer meet people’s needs. people are beginning to pursue high-quality lifestyles. therefore, the demand for cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption gradually increases. the population’s aging is intensifying. on the one hand, the elderly are retired and unemployed at home, therefore, in order to get rid of the state of doing nothing, they generally enrich their elderly lives through activities, such as reading, leisure, and vacation travel, which improves the consumption of culture, education, and entertainment. on the other hand, the consumption habits of the elderly are more conservative and difficult to change, and their social circle is narrow, which reduces their consumption of entertainment services related to social interaction. therefore, the impact of population aging on cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption needs to be further verified. (3) healthcare: with the population aging, the physical conditions and physical functions of the elderly are declining, and the demand for medical treatment, hygiene, and health care increases. therefore, population aging will drive up healthcare consumption. (4) other consumption: due to the strict implementation of the family planning policy, more and more families in our country have a “four-two-one” structure (y. wang [16]). as a result, these families’ demand for social elderly care services has increased. the demand for social services, such as elderly family nannies, elderly nursing services, and elderly housekeeping services has gradually increased. it can be observed that with the continuous aging of the age structure of the population, the demand for elderly services in the whole society will increase, and the elderly health care industry, elderly mental health counseling, and elderly home service industries related to the elderly will increase rapidly. therefore, population aging will inevitably increase the demand for the elderly service industry, and the proportion of consumption for elderly services in household expenditure will also increase. based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following assumptions: hypothesis 1: population aging reduces the consumption expenditure of the entire society in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. population aging helps the consumption structure to change from the traditional survival type to the enjoyment or development type consumption structure. 632 journal of advanced computational intelligence vol.26 no.4, 2022 and intelligent informatics influence of china’s population aging on household consumption hypothesis 2: population aging increases the consumption of health care in whole society, and the impact of population aging on culture, education, entertainment, transportation, and communication consumption has both positive and negative effects. 3. model establishment and data description 3.1. model establishment and estimation method according to the above analysis and mechanism analysis, we examine whether the aging of the population will impact household consumption expenditure. first, is this study consumption expenditure affected by the elderly? here, the dummy variable old of the elderly is set (the family with the elderly is set to 1, and the family without the elderly is set to 0), and the regression equation is as follows: ci = α0+α1oldi+δ xi+εi . . . . . . . . (1) where, ci represents the i-th family’s consumption details, such as food, water and electricity, transportation, and education expenses; x are other control variables, including the sex of the head of the household, the highest education level of the family, the health status of the head of the household, the size of the family, and the household registration, among others. second, in addition to the factors of population aging, this study further analyzes other factors that affect household consumption. while considering the differences in the influencing factors of household consumption at different consumption levels, this study uses quantile and semi-parametric regression models for analysis. the quantile model is represented as follows: cq(xi) =βqaodi+φqzi +μi . . . . . . . . (2) where, aod is the proportion of the family aged 65 and above in the total family population, and z is the control variable, including income, the highest education level of the family, the health status of the head of household, and family size, among others. at this time βq is the “q-quantile regression coefficient,” and the following minimization problem can be defined by its estimator: min βq n σ i:yi≥x′iβq q  yi−x′iβq  + n σ i:yi<x′iβq (1−q)  yi−x′iβq  (3) if q = 1/2, then it is the median regression. at this time, the objective function is simplified as follows: min βq n σi  yi−x′iβq  . . . . . . . . . . . . (4) since the objective function of quantile regression contains an absolute value and is not differentiable, it usually calculates ˆβ q by linear programming. it can be proved that the sample quantile regression coefficient ˆβ q is a consistent estimator of the overall quantile regression coefficient βq, and ˆβ q obeys an asymptotic normal distribution, that is: √n(ˆβ q − βq) d −→ n(0,avar(ˆβq)), where, the asymptotic variance avar(ˆβq) = a−1ba−1, a ≡ plimn→∞ 1/nσn i=1 fuq (0|xi)xix′i, b ≡ plimn→∞ 1/n σn i=1 q(1 − q)xix′i. fuq (0|xi) is the conditional density function of the disturbance term uq ≡ y−x′βq at the value of uq = 0. the semi-parametric model can be expressed as: yi = x′iβ +g(zi)+εi . . . . . . . . . . . (5) among them, the parameter part x′iβ is a linear function, and the non-parameter part g(zi) is an unknown function. assume that the mean value of the disturbance term εi is independent of the xi and zi, that is e(εi|xi, zi) = 0. this paper sets the family aging rate as a non-parametric factor. robinson proposed the “robinson difference estimator” to eliminate g(zi). given zi, removing the conditional expectations on both sides of the equation, we can get: e(yi|zi) = e(xi|zi)′β +g(zi)+e(εi|zi) . . . (6) according to the iterative expectation law, we can get: e(εi|zi) = exie  (εi|zi)|xi  = exie(εi|xi, zi) =0 (7) subtract the two equations to get: yi−e(yi|zi) =  xi−e(xi|zi)  ′β +εi . . . . (8) the unknown function g(zi) is eliminated in this difference equation, and non-parametric methods can estimate the conditional expectation e(yi|zi) and e(xi|zi). assuming that ˆe (yi|zi) and ˆe (xi|zi) are the non-parametric estimates of the e(yi|zi) and e(xi|zi), respectively, the following linear equations can be used for ols estimation: yi− ˆe (yi|zi) =  xi− ˆe (xi|zi)  ′β +μi. . . . . (9) this estimator is denoted as ˆβ pl because the conditional expectation estimator is used to replace the conditional expectation itself, so the disturbance term is no longer εi and is recorded as μi. assuming εi compliance iid(0,σ2), one can prove: √n  ˆβ pl −β  d −→ n ⎛ ⎝0,σ2 	 p lim n→∞ 1 n n σ i=1 wiw′i   −1 ⎞ ⎠ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (10) among them, wi ≡ xi −e(xi|zi). in the above formula, as long as the substitution ˆe(xi|zi) is used to e(xi|zi), the asymptotic covariance matrix var(ˆβpl) can be estimated. if there is heteroscedasticity, the sandwich estimator can be used to get a robust standard error. finally, the non-parametric estimate of the pair g(zi) can be obtained as: ˆ g(zi) = ˆe(yi|zi)− ˆe (xi|zi)′ ˆβpl. finally, as income is the main reason for determining consumption, the impact of population aging on consumption upgrades is also different for families of differ- vol.26 no.4, 2022 journal of advanced computational intelligence 633 and intelligent informatics chen, l. and zhao, x. ent income levels. hence, by drawing on the definitions of most studies, this study defines the sum of consumption expenditures on health care, culture, education, entertainment, and transportation and communication as developmental consumption. it divides income into three categories in ascending order, namely low-income (the top 20%), middle-income (middle 60%), and high-income (bottom 20%), based on a sample of low-, middle-, and high-income households to analyze the impact of population aging on household developmental consumption. the econometric model representation is as follows: cf i =α0+α1aodi +δ xi+εi, . . . . . . . (11) medf i =α0+α1aodi+δ xi+εi, . . . . . . (12) trcf i =α0+α1aodi+δ xi+εi, . . . . . . (13) eduf i =α0+α1aodi+δ xi+εi. . . . . . . (14) where cf, medf, trcf, and eduf represent consumption in the areas of household development, medical, transportation and communication, cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption, respectively. other control variables represented by x, include the proportion of the juvenile household population, income, household consumption expenditure, the proportion of household children, the urbanization rate, and the health status of the head of the household, among others. since the current medical security in china is not perfect, the health status may significantly affect the effect of population aging on household consumption expenditure. therefore, the interaction term between population aging and health status is added as a control variable. 3.2. date sources and descriptive statistics the data used in this study were extracted from the 2016 china family panel studies (cfps2016) national micro survey data. cfps2016 surveyed 14019 households, including 6917 urban households, 6682 rural households, and 320 missing information. in this study, the research mainly involves the content of household consumption, household income, household assets, and household demographic characteristics in the china family panel studies. the household demographic information is represented by household head information. as the head of the household is not clearly defined in the china family panel studies, this study refers to the head of the household as the “financial respondent” in the household questionnaire. for data processing, first, match the data, take the family code (fid16) as the family research object, and extract the household consumption, household income, household assets, and other data of all 14019 households in the household table, and 36892 in the household adult table. according to the family code, the age, sex, education, and other data of 8427 children in the adult and family children tables are matched and combined into a new data table. the second is to delete the data. delete the samples with null values for household income, total household consumption expenditures, and table 1. basic family information descriptive statistics. variable symbol mean sd consumption c 15773.81 16532.45 income i 25640.31 28677.75 the head health qp201 3.10 1.18 family size fs 3.28 1.73 registration urban 0.51 0.50 financial assets d1 21858.93 66374.50 cash and deposits d2 0.06 0.24 age of the head age 49.44 14.68 family aging rate aod 0.16 0.30 family childization acd 0.14 0.18 the head’ sex gender 0.52 0.50 highest education hedu 3.31 1.35 commercial insurance d3 610.95 2564.71 household consumption expenditures; delete household registration and samples with the highest academic qualifications in the most recent survey as “unknown” or “not applicable”; the 1%highest and lowest outliers in the consumption data will be tailed off. finally, a nationally representative sample of 6587 households was obtained, including 3382 in urban and 3205 in rural areas. the descriptive statistics of the variables are shown in table 1. additionally, to avoid the regression coefficient being too large or too small in the regression process, the logarithm of the various household consumption expenditure items, household consumption expenditure, household income, cash and deposits, and commercial insurance costs, among others are taken. simultaneously, the above variables are 0. the value variable is assigned the value 1, and then the logarithm is taken. 4. estimated results and analysis 4.1. regression benchmark tables 2 and 3 report the estimation results using the ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regression methods. this is because when the perturbations of the equations in the seemingly unrelated regression model satisfy eεiε ′i = σ2 i i and eεiε ′j = 0 (i = j), the estimated results are the same as those of ols (c. hsiao [17]). from the regression results in tables 2 and 3, it can be found that whether a family has an elderly person will affect the family’s consumption, and there are significant differences in the consumption of each item of this impact. next, we will analyze in detail the influence of the elderly on the expenditures of household consumption items. (1) consumption items positively affected by the elderly. the elderly persons have increased most families’ basic living consumption expenditures, such as food, water and electricity, fuel, property, tourism, medical treatment, and health care expenses.

(3) consumption items not significantly affected by the elderly. whether elderly people are in the home does not impact expenditures, such as heating bills, housing maintenance, and social donations. the above estimation results agree with our expected hypothesis. the above estimates agree with our expected assumptions that the elderly increasemedical and health care consumption, mainly due to, on the one hand, the gradual decline in physical function and health level of the elderly as their age increases; on the other hand, the elderly will pay more attention to their health, so medical and health care costs will inevitably increase. the elderly increase tourismexpenditure. as children want to accompany their parents more, family travel is a good way to accompany parents and include fun in their later lives. the elderly people reduce the expenditure on postal and telecommunications services and local transportation. the reason may be that after the elderly return to family life, they have less time to socialize with others, thus reducing related consumption. the elderly people reduce the consumption of education and training because the young and middle-aged will participate in some education and training activities to improve their workability and work experience. when people are approaching retirement or have retired, their expectations for themselves are lower, so they spend less on education and training. 4.2. influence factors of different levels of consumption in this study, mean, quantile, and semi-parametric regressions are carried out on household consumption expenditure. the regression results are shown in table 4. from table 4, we found that except for household registration, the ols estimates of the coefficient values of other variables are all less than 0.5 of the median regression estimate, indicating that the lower tail consumption data weaken the effect of these variables on average consumption. the semiparametric regression results are close to ols when only the aging rate is set as a non-parameter factor. next, we analyze the quantile regression results and find that (1) the income coefficient is positive in each quantile. with the increase in income, household consumption also increases, which agrees with the economic theory’s expectations. the income elasticity of consumption increases with income. (2) the impact of population aging on the consumption of low-consumption households is greater than that of medium- and high-consumption households. (3) the highest levels of education and health in the family have a significantly greater impact on the consumption of low- and middle-level income households than on the consumption of high-income households. for low- and middle-level consumer families, the higher the family education, the stronger their ability to accept new things; the decline in health status increases the demand for medical and health care; and the family medical consumption expenditure increases.

(5) the influence of urban households on consumption is positive, and the influence of household registration on consumption is inversely related to consumption level, and gradually decreases at the 0.1–0.9 percentile. (6) the impact of cash deposits on consumption is negative. in other words, cash deposits are savings. the corresponding consumption decreases when a household’s savings increase. the influence of cash deposits on consumption in low- and medium-consumption households gradually increases, while the influence of cash deposits on high-consumption households is minimal. 4.3. sample of households with different incomes according to the regression results in the previous subsection, household consumption largely depends on household income level. the regression results based on three household samples of low, middle, and high income are shown in table 5. from the regression results in table 5, it can be found that (1) population aging negatively impacts family developmental consumption, which is inconsistent with the research conclusion of w. wang et al. [18]. the negative impact of transportation, communication, cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption is greater than the positive impact of population aging on health care consumption. furthermore, the observation coefficient shows that the higher the family’s income level, the less the negative impact of population aging on its developmental consumption. (2) population aging has a significant positive impact on health care consumption. mainly, this is because with the development of the social economy and the improvement of medical and health technology, people pay more attention to their physical health regardless of their income level. physical function is declining with the aging of the elderly, and the demand for medical and health care services is increasing. therefore, the consumption expenditure on health care increases. in addition, the observation coefficient shows that the lower the family’s income, the more significant the impact of population aging. (3) the aging of low- and middle-income families significantly negatively impacts transportation, communication, cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption. this result may be because, on the one hand, the elderly people have retired and no longer work, and their demand for continuing education or job training and going out has dramatically reduced. on the other hand, the elderly have changed from family savers to consumers; thus, the burden of family support and the demand for medical care will increase, which may have a 636 journal of advanced computational intelligence vol.26 no.4, 2022 and intelligent informatics influence of china’s population aging on household consumption “squeeze effect” on transportation, communication, cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption. the negative impact on high-income families is insignificant because the “squeeze effect” of high-income families is not apparent. 5. conclusion and enlightenment this study explores the mechanism and causes of the impact of population aging on household consumption, and uses the china family panel studies (cfps2016) data as the research sample to conduct an empirical test. the main conclusions are as follows. (1) population aging will impact household consumption expenditure. on the one hand, population aging promotes the vast majority of basic household consumption such as water and electricity, fuel, heating, property, and housing maintenance expenses. on the other hand, expenditure inhibits most family enjoyment or development consumption expenditures, such as dining out, transportation and communication, local transportation, culture, education and entertainment, purchasing cars, furniture, education and training, and beauty. (2) population aging, family income, family’s highest educational level, and family size have a more significant impact on low-level consumption than on high-level consumption. (3) the impact of population aging on developmental consumption varies across income levels in families. compared with high-income families, population aging in low- and middle-income families has a more significant impact on health care, transportation, and communication, as well as cultural, educational, and entertainment consumption. based on the above analysis, this study draws the following inspirations. (1) the elderly significantly impact household consumption. in order to encourage the elderly to consume, it is important to improve the social security mechanism, increase the pension income level of the elderly, and develop and release the consumption potential of the elderly. the development of the elderly industry will improve the supply level of the elderly population industry, create high-quality elderly care products and services suitable for the elderly, and promote the upgrading of the consumption structure. (2) the impact of the highest family education level on consumption cannot be ignored either. to improve the level of consumption, it is important to promote consumption upgrade, adhere to the priority development of education, and improve the education level of residents. increase financial investment in education expenditure and increase investment in human capital; improve the compulsory education system, popularize high school education, increase the enrollment rate of higher education, and increase the average number of years of education for residents; strengthen general education at the social level, and expand the knowledge and skills of residents. vision improves residents’ rapid access to information and processing capabilities, enhances residents’ ability to accept and master new consumption patterns, cultivates residents’ preferences for development and enjoyment-oriented consumption, improves consumption levels, and promotes consumption upgrades. acknowledgments this project was subsidized by national natural science foundation of china (71973049). references: [1] r. mao and j. xu, “demographic transition consumption structure disparities and industrial growth,” population research, vol.38, no.3, pp. 89-104, 2014 (in chinese).
