these fish are generated using female fish from domesticated stocks and male fish of wild origin. the survival rate of released semi-wild fish is higher than that of farmed fish, but the reason for this is unknown. this study compared the metabolism and swimming performance of semi-wild and farmed masu salmon (oncorynchus masou). the analyses showed that resting metabolic rate (rmr), maximum metabolic rate (mmr) and swimming speeds that minimize energy costs of travel (optimal swimming speed) were higher in semi-wild fish than in farmed fish. critical swimming speed did not differ significantly between the two groups of fish. semi-wild fish with high rmr may have a social status advantage over farmed fish because a previous study reported that smr, which is the value closest to basal metabolism significantly affects feeding motivation. this means that individuals with higher social status may be more motivated to feed. as rmr is proportional to food requirements, then release programs should be planned taking food resources at the release site into consideration. 1. introduction many fish species have been domesticated over multiple generations and maintained in artificial hatcheries for use in species conservation or fishery stock enhancement (fraser, 2008; lorenzen et al., 2012). occasionally, individuals from these hatcheries escape into the natural environment; in addition, fish may be deliberately released into the wild for stock enhancement or management (hyman et al., 2016). salmonids are a prime example of large-scale artificial incubation and release programs (fraser, 2008). in japan, masu salmon (oncorhynchus masou), which has been subjected to multiple generations of artificial breeding in hatcheries, has been actively released in many areas to enhance populations in mountain streams (morita et al., 2006). despite an aggressive policy of release, commercial catches have declined since the 1970s (miyakoshi et al., 2008; nagata et al., 2012). the increase in recreational catches of juvenile fish may be one of the reasons for this fall in commercial catches (ando et al., 2002). however, in 2021, a trend of increasing abundance was observed in some areas of honshu and in rivers in the east of hokkaido, hokkaido, japan (sahashi et al., 2018); by 2020, catches in the waters around japan were at the second lowest level after 2017, but are considered to be in the middle of the stock fluctuations over the past 20 years (hasegawa and fukui, 2022). however, for the sustainable use of masu salmon stocks, the, more effective fish production and release techniques are required. it has been reported that hatchery-reared and domesticated salmonids used in release programs have lower survival rates than wild fish due to a lower ability to adapt to the natural environment (araki et al., 2007, 2008; berejikian and ford, 2004; mclean et al., 2003). the low adaptability of domesticated salmonids may have resulted from selection for traits that are important for hatchery growth and survival but not for the natural environment (einum and fleming, 2001; solberg et al., 2015). for example, hatchery-reared juvenile steelhead trout show reduced predator avoidance compared to wild fish (berejikian, 1995). studies using meta-analyses have reported that captive salmonids are more aggressive and less responsive to predators, resulting in lower survival rates in the natural environment (einum and fleming, 2001). in addition, in masu salmon, the timing of smoltification (koyama et al., 2007) and predator avoidance ability (yamamoto and reinhardt, 2003) differ between captive fish and wild individuals. the behavioral and physiological differences between hatchery and wild fish * corresponding author. e-mail address: yuya.makiguchi@gmail.com (y. makiguchi). contents lists available at sciencedirect comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/cbpa https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.111328 received 28 may 2022;

instead, hatchery-derived fish may replace wild conspecifics (sahashi et al., 2015). measures have been taken to reduce the effects of domestication, such as the use of captive-bred stock that has not experienced more than one generation in captivity, but this has not solved the problem. the underlying cause of the competition between hatchery-derived and wild individuals is unknown. to elucidate the basis of this problem, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms that affect juvenile fish survival during early life stages in the natural environment is required. in japan, to correct the release effects caused by such differences in the characteristics of wild and farmed fish, the creation of semi-wild fish with wild fish as fathers and farmed fish as mothers has been proposed. (japan fisheries agency, 2018). semi-wild fish are more difficult to feed than hatchery-bred fish during the fry growth period and require more time and effort to produce. because farmed fish have a high fecundity combined with wild fish characteristics, it is thought that a balance can be achieved in the field after release. the basis of this approach is that the high reproductive rate of domesticated fish can be complemented by the adaptability to the natural environment of wild fish. semi-wild fish have been reported to have intermediate physiological responses to environmental stresses compared to hatchery and wild fish (solberg et al., 2013). in a study on egg-to-smolt survival in a natural environment in atlantic salmon (salmo salar), semi-wild fish were reported to have a lower survival rate than wild fish but a higher survival rate than farmed fish (skaala et al., 2012). in white-spotted char (salvelinus leucomaenis), the survival rate of released semi-wild fish was 2.5 times higher than that of farmed fish (yamashita et al., 2020). in turbid water environments, semi-wild fish have been reported to have a 3.2-fold higher upstream migration performance than farmed fish (yamashita and suzuki, 2019). an increase in the proportion of genes derived from wild fish in masu salmon and chum salmon (o. keta) was shown to increase the wild survival of captive-bred fish (sahashi and morita, 2022). however, there are still many unanswered questions regarding why semi-wild fish show higher survival rates than farmed fish. juvenile salmonid form dominance hierarchies within the rivers they inhabit (yamamoto et al., 1998). ranking in the hierarchy is closely related to foraging behavior, habitat use, growth, and migration (nakano, 1995). dominant individuals exclusively use the middle and surface layers of pools as foraging habitats. they have preferential access to drifting food, resulting in more significant growth and higher sedentariness than more subordinate individuals (nakano, 1995). a study of social status in a hierarchy and physiological responses in juvenile atlantic salmon showed a strong correlation between standard metabolic rate (smr) and rank in the hierarchy, with higher smr indicating higher rank (metcalfe et al., 1995). this correlation was influenced by the density of individuals in the habitat, with lower densities resulting in less aggression and competition, higher mean food intake and growth rates, and no relationship between smr and growth rates (reid et al., 2011). in other words, at high densities where the availability of suitable feeding habitat is limited, individuals with high smr will have lower growth due to the cost of maintaining their ranking at the top of the hierarchy. on the other hand, individuals with low smr will not secure enough food and will be disadvantaged in the competition for survival. thus, the metabolic rate of an individual is an essential factor that determines its competitiveness for food resources. metabolic rate is an essential physiological indicator that determines survival in the field because behavior such as feeding, escape from predators and competitors, digestion, growth, and reproduction all require oxygen (eliason and farrell, 2016). furthermore, the relationship between current velocity and feeding success is important in drift feeder habitat selection and hierarchy formation (bozeman and grossman, 2019). in other words, the ability to swim to localization is an important indicator in assessing competitive ability of fish in rivers. therefore, we hypothesized that when fish density in a habitat is increased by release, the higher metabolism of semi-wild fish than that of released farmed fish will result in a higher ranking in the hierarchy for semi-wild fish, and as a result, semi-wild fish will be more likely to become established in their natural environment than farmed fish. according to our hypothesis, semi-wild fish are more likely to become established in the natural environment than farmed fish. a semi-wild fish and a farmed fish were created in this study, both of which have the same mother and father as wild or farmed fish. we compared the metabolism and swimming ability of the two groups of fry by means of swimming respirometry. 2. materials and methods 2.1. capture of parent fish, artificial insemination, and incubation of fertilized eggs all of the researchers who participated in this study have taken an ethics course on animal experiments at the college of bioresource sciences, nihon university. all experiments were conducted following the ethical regulations for animal experiments of the college of bioresource sciences, nihon university. in this study, the experiment was conducted on masu salmon (oncorhynchus masou) to measure the metabolism and swimming performance. the experiments were conducted from november 2018 and november 2019 at akita prefectural institute of fisheries. both wild and farmed fish were used as male parents. the wild fish were collected in october 2018 and october 2019 using a cast net and an electrofisher in the juninosawa stream, a tributary of the ani river, akita prefecture (fig. s1). no artificially hatched individuals have so far been released into the juninosawa stream; thus, the 10 captured males each year were assumed to be wild fish. wild fish of resident forms were used as experimental fish. fish raised in inland water test ponds at the akita prefectural institute of fisheries were used as the farmed fish. the farmed fish used in the experiment were gametes collected from masu salmon caught in the ani river, artificially inseminated, and reared in inland water test ponds of the akita prefectural institute of fisheries. seven generations of farmed fish were used as parents for the farmed fish of male and female in 2018. eight generations of male farmed fish and four generations of female farmed fish were used as farmed parents in 2019. mean total body length and body mass of fish used as parents were shown in fig. s2. the sampled individuals of both sexes were immobilized in fa100 (ds pharma animal health co., ltd., osaka, japan), liquid with eugenol adjusted at 10% to 100 ml of ethanol diluted to 0.5 ml/l in river water, and then placed on a scale. the left side of the fish was photographed using a digital camera (nikon 1 aw1, nikon corporation, tokyo, japan). the weight scale was surrounded by a light-shielding sheet in a 1 m cube so that the images of the experimental fish were not affected by ambient light. after capturing the images, the weights and body sizes of the experimental fish were measured from the digital images using imagej (schneider et al., 2012). for animal welfare reasons, both sexes of adult fish were over anesthetized and euthanized before gametes were extracted. after photography, the abdomen of each male was dried with a towel and semen was gently extruded and stored in whirl-pak sample bags, taking care to avoid contamination with water, urine, or feces. the sperm samples were stored in a cooler box maintained at 4 ◦c until used for fertilization. the abdomen of each female was opened with dissecting scissors, the eggs were transferred to a bowl, and approximately 150–200 eggs were quickly placed into the ends of two ziploc containers (80 mm long x 156 mm wide x 53 mm high) using a mesh strainer. semen from wild and farmed fish were used separately for fertilization. approximately 100 μl of semen was dropped into the opposite end of the ziploc container using a micropipette; 100 ml of spring water was slowly poured into the container to enable fertilization of the eggs. fertilized eggs were allowed to stand for 1 h and then placed in an incubation tank containing 10 × 10 × 10 cm mesh baskets. ninety days after hatching, y. makiguchi et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 275 (2023) 111328 3 fish from both groups were transferred to circular tanks (140 cm diameter and 70 cm height) to reduce density. after yolk absorption, the fish were provided with formula feed three to five times a day according to their body size for 371 days in the experiment commenced in 2018 and 291 days in the 2019 experiment. the juveniles of both groups were separately kept in common environmental conditions to ensure that any behavioral differences observed during the experiment were due to genetic rather than environmental differences. 2.2. metabolism and swimming ability measurement the juvenile fish generated in november 2018 were subjected to metabolic and swimming ability measurements in october 2019 at the akita prefectural institute of fisheries (hereafter referred to as the 2019 experiment). the juvenile fish generated in november 2019 were moved to the college of bioresource sciences, nihon university, fujisawa, kanagawa, japan in august 2020 where they were acclimated in a 9 ◦c tank for one week (hereafter referred to as the 2020 experiment). a swim tunnel respirometer (model: 1500 ml, loligo systems, viborg, denmark) was used to measure the swimming ability and oxygen consumption of each individual. the area in which the fish could swim was 55 mm in diameter × 200 mm in length. at the akita prefectural institute of fisheries, spring water at about 10 ◦c was circulated through the respirometer; at the college of bioresource sciences, the water was circulated through a plastic box maintained at 9 ◦c using a cooler to minimize fluctuations in water temperature during the experiment. in the swim-tunnel respirometer, the flow velocity was controlled using a propeller located downstream. calibration of the velocity was performed before the fish were in place. sensors for measuring dissolved oxygen were installed upstream. dissolved oxygen was measured at 1 hz using a witrox 1 oxygen meter (loligo systems, viborg, denmark). to minimize visual stimulation of the swimming fish, the experimental tank was covered with black plastic sheets. a small window was created next to the swimming area to check the swimming conditions during the experiment. the water was changed for each individual to prevent the accumulation of nitrogen waste. changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations were recorded multiple times in the absence of the fish and the variation was found to be negligible. the water temperature during the experiment was adjusted to maintain it within ±1.5 ◦c of the temperature at the start of the experiment. the metabolic experiments were conducted from october 3 to november 2 in 2019, from august 2 to october 14 in 2020. during the experimental period described above, we started the experiment at 7:00–9:00 a.m. and recorded data from a maximum of three individuals per day. there were also days when the experiment could not be conducted during the period. as the fish are growing during this period, the effects of growth were minimized by ensuring the order in which the experiments were conducted was not biased in favor of one group; the experiments were conducted using individuals from each group in turn. the fish used in the experiment were fasted for 24 h to minimize the effects of energy consumption associated with food digestion. 2.3. experimental protocol before starting the experiment, total body lengths (tls) of the experimental fish were measured as described in section 2.1. experimental fish were gently placed into the swimming section of the cylinder to avoid stress. at the beginning of the experiment, the speed of the water current in the respirometer is set as double the body length of the fish to remove air bubbles in the swimming area. acclimation was carried out for 1 h at a flow rate of 0.5 tl/s. during acclimation, the flow rate in the swimming area was kept constant and the water was circulated using a pump to prevent the dissolved oxygen level from significant decreasing (fig. s3). if the dissolved oxygen level did not decrease stably during rmr measurement, we either started from the beginning or replaced the experimental fish with new ones. therefore, it took up to 5 h to measure the metabolism of one individual. after acclimation, the water hole, which connects the swimming area to the circulating water reservoir, was plugged and the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded over a 0.5–1 h period. a flow rate of 0.5 tl/s was maintained in the respirometer and the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded after confirming that it was decreasing linearly. based on the recorded dissolved oxygen, oxygen consumption (referred to as mo2: mg o2/h) was calculated from the following equation: mo2 = [o2]v where [o2] is the rate of decrease in that concentration in mgo2 l􀀀 1 h􀀀 1, v is the volume of the swimming area (1.5 l). the rate of decrease in that concentration was determined by using the slope value approximated by a linear function from the start time to the end time of the measurement section. the metabolic rate during this period was defined as the resting metabolic rate (rmr). the reason is that during this period, the fish swam slowly and moved their fins lightly to maintain their posture in the dissolved oxygen meter. on the other hand, smr is defined as the closest approximation to basal metabolism when organs are completely still (chabot et al., 2016). therefore, in this study, the metabolic rate measured during this period was considered rmr. at the flow rate of 0.5 tl/s, the fish rarely swam. after measurement of rmr, the plug was removed from the water passage hole in the swimming area and the water was allowed to flow for about 0.5 h to bring the dissolved oxygen concentration to saturation. at the end of this period when the dissolved oxygen concentration had returned to the level before the start of the experiment, the swimming area was again sealed with a plug. initially, the flow rate was set to 1.5 tl/s and the experimental fish was able to swim in this current. the flow rate was then increased by 0.5 tl/s every 10 min; the increase in flow rate induced the fish to swim. when the experimental fish became tired and began to stay downstream, the fish were stimulated by exposing them to led lights. if the fish still could not swim, the speed at that point was defined as the final speed at which the fish could no longer swim. the swimming test was terminated when the fish could not escape from the downstream area for more than 5 s after doing this. the maximum metabolic rate (mmr) calculated as the oxygen consumption per unit time during the highest flow rate.; ucrit is defined as the highest swimming speed that a fish can maintain during a defined time interval (brett, 1964, 1967; peake et al., 1997). ucrit is generally measured as cm/s or tl/s and is calculated as follows (brett, 1965): ucrit = up+ui tp ti where up is the velocity at which the fish last swam for the full period, ui is the increase in speed (0.5tl/s), tp is the duration in minutes that the fish was able to swim against the water velocity that produced fatigue, and ti is the time interval at which the speed was increased (10 min). as the fish were small relative to the cross-sectional area of the swim tunnels, the ucrit values were not corrected to account for the solid blocking effect of the individuals (bell and terhune, 1970). at the end of the experiment, the fish were immobilized using a 0.05% of 2-phenoxyethanol; the weights of the fish were measured to the nearest 0.1 g as described in section 2.1. the relationship between mo2 and swimming speed (u) at each speed was described using the exponential function: mo2 = aebu where a is the metabolic rate at rest or rmr, u is the swimming speed, and b is a constant (behrens et al., 2006). the cost of transport (cot) is expressed in terms of distance traveled per hour (km) as a function of u using the exponential function: cot(u) = aebu􀀀 1 y. makiguchi et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 275 (2023) 111328 4 cot(u) was calculated and the value at which it became zero was set as the optimum swimming speed (uopt) at which the transportation cost becomes minimum (cotmin; behrens et al., 2006). differentiating the expression of cot(u) once and setting uopt to the value of u when the slope of the tangent line becomes zero, we obtain the following equation. uopt = 1/b cotmin was obtained by inserting uopt into cot(u). water temperature during the swimming experiment was 10.69 ± 0.49 ◦c for semi-wild fish and 11.09 ± 0.78 ◦c for farmed fish in the 2019 experiment, and 8.98 ± 1.20 ◦c for semi-wild fish and 8.79 ± 0.32 ◦c for farmed fish in the 2020 experiment; the differences in temperature were not significant (t = 1.152, p = 0. 272 for 2019 experiment; t = 􀀀 0.384, p = 0.704 for 2020 experiment). 2.4. statistical analysis body mass and total body length of fish at the time of experiment were compared between the semi-wild and farmed fish in the 2019 and 2020 experiments using t-tests. rmr, mmr, ucrit, uopt, and cotmin were used as a single data set for 2019 and 2020 without distinction, and were compared between semi-wild and farmed fish using linear models. rmr and mmr were compared between semi-wild and farmed fish using a linear model with body mass as a covariate. to clarify the comparison between semi-wild and farmed fish, which was the objective of this study, a null model was set up with each parameter as response variable and only year parameter as explanatory variable, and for rmr and mmr, this null for rmr and mmr, a null model was set up with body weight as a covariate and type of fish as an explanatory variable, and for ucrit, uopt, and cotmin a model was set up with type of fish as an explanatory variable. these models were compared by null model and anova to determine the impact of the added explanatory variables. r software ver. 3.62 (team, r core, 2017) was used for the analysis. a significance level of 5% was defined as statistically significant. 3. results oxygen consumption increased with increasing speed in the two groups (fig. 1(a) for 2019, fig. 1(b) for 2020). body weight and caudal fork lengths did not differ significantly between the two groups of fish in either experiment (t = 􀀀 0.69, p = 0.51 for body mass in 2019, t = 􀀀 0.28, p = 0.78 for body mass in 2020, t = 0.02, p = 0.98 for fork length in 2019, t = 0.04, p = 0.97 for fork length in 2020; table 1). rmr and mmr were larger in semi-wild than farmed fish (table 2). uopt was also larger in semi-wild fish than farmed fish (table 2). no differences were found between semi-wild and farmed fish for ucrit in tl, ucrit in cm, and cotmin (table 2). 4. discussion this study compared the metabolism of semi-wild and farmed fish in the ani river, akita prefecture, japan. the physiological differences between the two types of fish were discussed in terms of their potential impact on the survival of juvenile salmon after release for the conservation of masu salmon resources. the swimming and metabolic performances of semi-wild fish (produced using sperm derived from wild fish) and of farmed fish (produced using males reared for 6 or 7 generations in the hatchery) were compared using swimming respirometry as a possible factor to explain the difference of the survival rate between farmed and semi-wild fish. the results showed that rmr, mmr, the upper limit of the maximum metabolic rate and uopt were smaller in farmed fish than in semi-wild fish. there was no difference in swimming ability indexes such as ucrit and body size between the two groups. rmr differed between the semi-wild and farmed fish even though the experimental fish were reared in the same environment, suggesting that paternal origin had a significant genetic influence. smr, which was smaller in farmed fish than in semi-wild fish, has been reported to be an essential indicator of hierarchical ranking in river life in juvenile atlantic salmon (metcalfe et al., 1995; reid et al., 2011) and masu salmon (yamamoto et al., 1998). specifically, the higher the smr, the higher the position in the hierarchy. as a result, fish at the top of the hierarchy can acquire better feeding grounds. socially dominant salmonid fry grow faster than their subdominant conspecifics (metcalfe et al., 1992), and the resulting body size advantage can reinforce social fig. 1. relationship between oxygen consumption (mgo2 kg􀀀 1 h􀀀 1) and swimming speed (bl s􀀀 1) in 2019

makiguchi et al. comparative biochemistry and physiology, part a 275 (2023) 111328 5 hierarchies. previous studies have reported that hatchery salmonid fish have lower survival rates during the juvenile stage than wild and semiwild fish (skaala et al., 2012; yamashita et al., 2020). in this study, rmr was measured as an alternative to smr, but the finding of lower rmr in farmed fish compared to semi-wild fish in this study may suggest a mechanism for the reported lower survival rates of farmed fish compared to that of semi-wild fish. in this scenario, farmed fish with a relatively low rmr may have a lower social status in river life than semiwild fish and thus have a lower chance of obtaining suitable feeding grounds, resulting in lower survival rates for farmed fish compared to semi-wild fish. furthermore, mmr was also higher in semi-wild fish compared to farmed fish. however, no difference was found in ucri, which is indicators of active physiology, swimming performance, and have been reported to be related with athletic performance and swimming performance (plaut, 2001). in other words, the swimming performance of semi-wild and farmed fish at the sizes examined in this study were almost identical. therefore, there may be competition between semiwild and farmed fish in some areas, such as feeding and escape based on high swimming performance in the natural environment. in foodconstrained circumstances such as the natural environment, individuals with high rmr and mmr may have an advantage in feeding. because individuals with high smr consume food faster (millidine et al., 2009), smr size significantly affects feeding performance in environments where competition for food occurs. however, smr becomes less critical in food-rich environments (auer et al., 2015). it should be noted that these results are only indirect evidence of the competitive relationship between semi-wild and farmed fish, as this study did not examine semi-wild and farmed fish in an actual river. in future experiments, it will be necessary to determine the comparative social status of the semi-wild and farmed fish in the natural environment and how this impacts their interactions. uopt, the swimming speed based on aerobic exercise, which is the most energy-efficient unit transportation cost, was greater in semi-wild fish than in farmed fish. on the other hand, there was no difference between the two groups in ucrit, the critical point from aerobic to anaerobic exercise; ucrit is faster than uopt and is not suitable for prolonged swimming. a study comparing the ucrit of wild and farmed fish reported no difference between the two (dunmall and schreer, 2003), implying that semi-wild fish with fast uopt can cruise at a somewhat higher speed than farmed fish in riverine living conditions and currents. considering these results, semi-wild fish may have an advantage over farmed fish in food requirements and territorial disputes. however, there is competition between semi-wild and farmed fish in natural environments with various velocity zones. the habitat preferences of juvenile salmonids vary among seasons (nagayama and nakamura, 2007), with juvenile salmonids preferring deep water and relatively high-velocity areas during the late summer and fall seasons. juvenile salmonids are primarily sedentary foragers receiving a continuous supply of drifting invertebrates such as euphausiid larvae (keeley and grant, 1997). therefore, individuals that can hold their position in fast currents are more efficient at foraging for drifting invertebrates and have an advantage for survival (nakano, 1995). the efficiency of foraging by juvenile fish increases when the current is faster and the water is deeper (h¨ojesj¨o et al., 2016). converting uopt to cm/s units (nielsen, 1992), uopt was 36.4 cm/s for semi-wild fish and 28.0 cm/s for farmed fish in 2019, and 29.2 cm/s for semi-wild fish and 21.2 cm/s for farmed fish in 2020. although differences in uopt due to body size effects must be taken into account, sato et al. (2016) reported that in the juninosawa stream, where the wild masu salmon used in this study were captured, the fish showed reproductive behavior in conditions with an average flow velocity of 33.3 cm/s. although the spawning grounds and fry habitat did not exactly coincide, the uopt of the semi-wild fish was closer to the average velocity of the river than that of the farmed fish. this suggests that semi-wild fish are more likely than farmed fish to maintain position in a fast-flowing current in order to sustain efficient foraging. in this study, cotmin, the oxygen consumption per unit time and distance in uopt, did not differ between hatchery and semi-wild fish. this result implies that the swimming cost of farmed fish is inefficiently high when they swim at the same speed as the semi-wild fish, suggesting that they may be less competitive in food acquisition. thus, semi-wild fish can maintain their positions in faster currents than farmed fish, giving them an advantage in food acquisition. this ability may explain why semi-wild fish have a higher survival rate in natural rivers than farmed fish. the fish were older at the time of testing in 2019 than in 2020, but there was no difference in average age, weight or length between semiwild and farmed fish in either experiment. there was no difference in weight and length between semi-wild and farmed fish in each experiment. growth and survival rates of juveniles have been reported to be unaffected by the availability of food under the semi-natural conditions in which the experiments were conducted (robertsen et al., 2019). semiwild fish also consume more food than farmed fish of the same species (hatanp¨a¨a et al., 2020). the fry used in the present study were produced by fertilization of eggs on the same day and reared under the same environmental conditions with adequate feeding; the absence of any difference in growth between the semi-wild and farmed fish is consistent with previous studies. hatcheries are selected to be rich in food resources and to have high juvenile fish growth rates (gross, 1998). however, it is unclear how fry growth varies between the two groups in natural environments where sufficient food is not always available. under such conditions, fish have been reported to prioritize growth promotion over increases in metabolic rates (bochdansky et al., 2005). there is a trade-off between metabolic rate and growth; because food is more restricted in natural than farmed environments, semi-wild fish with higher smrs than farmed fish have higher food requirements, which may lead to insufficient resources and reduced growth under overcrowded conditions after release (biro and stamps, 2008; ridgway, 2008). when semi-wild and farmed fish are released into the natural environment, the number of fish to be released must be determined based on the environmental carrying capacity, i.e., by considering the potential amount of food available to the fish. otherwise, the growth of the semi-wild fish may be reduced due to competition for food. although released semi-wild fish have a lower survival rate in the juvenile stage than wild fish, they grow so quickly that they can displace wild juveniles table 2 ucrit,rmr, mmr, uopt and cotmin of fish from semi-wild and farmed fish cross in 2019 and 2020.sample sizes were 7 each for semi-natural

natural habitat (mcginnity et al., 2003). this kind of competition may also occur between semi-wild and farmed fish. although the survival rate of semi-wild fish is 2.5 times higher than that of farmed fish in the natural environment (yamashita et al., 2020), semiwild fish have a lower survival rate than wild fish (skaala et al., 2012). it is therefore better to release semi-wild fish than fully farmed fish, but the effectiveness of the release may be reduced due to competition with native wild fish. the results of this study clearly show a difference in rmr between semi-wild and farmed fish. when releasing semi-wild or farmed fish, it is necessary to carefully examine the food resources in the habitat and to determine in advance the appropriate number of fish to be released to avoid generating food shortages. in addition, from the perspective of maintaining resources in rivers, the results of this study also indicate that it is better to use sperm from wild fish when generating fish for release. most fish released in mountain stream fisheries in japan, including masu salmon, have been derived from hatchery reared fish because of the relative ease of their production under artificial, controlled environments. based on the results of this study, it is clearly more desirable to produce and release semi-wild fish in light of their competitive behavior with farmed and wild fish in rivers. supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.111328. credit authorship contribution statement yuya makiguchi: conceptualization,
