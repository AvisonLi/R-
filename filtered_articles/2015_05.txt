of psychiatry, new york university school of medicine, new york, new york, usa; 4department of population health, nyu school of medicine, new york, new york, usa background: the population of adults accessing opioid treatment is growing older, but exact estimates vary widely, and little is known about the characteristics of the aging treatment population. further, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology, healt h status, and functional impairments in this population. objectives: to determine the utilization of opioid treatment services by older adults in new york city. methods: this study used administrative data from new york state licensed drug treatment programs to examine overall age trends and characteristics of older adults in opioid treatment programs in new york city from 1996 to 2012. results: we found significant increases in utilization of opioid treatment programs by older adults in new york city. by 2012, those aged 50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment programs. among older adults there were notable shifts in demographic background including gender and ethnicity, and an increase in self-reported impairments. conclusions/importance: more research is needed to fully understand the specific characteristics and needs of older adults with opioid dependence. keywords geriatrics, older adults, opioid dependence, methadone, geriatric conditions introduction opioid dependence is a chronic condition characterized by periods of relapse, and accompanied by physical and mental health problems and social marginalization. the aging baby-boomer cohort has high rates of substance use (patterson & jeste, 1999) that will place increasing demands and costs (rosen, heberlein, & engel, 2013) on the substance abuse treatment system, particularly for address correspondence to benjamin han, division of geriatric medicine and palliative care, new york university school of medicine, 550 first avenue, bcd 615, new york, ny 10016, usa; e-mail: benjamin.han@nuymc.org long-term treatment of opioid dependence. small studies have found that older adults in methadone maintenance treatment (mmt) have higher rates of mental health disorders along with more medical problems, and general poorer health status compared to younger patients, as well as premature mortality (firoz & carlson, 2004; lofwall, brooner, bigelow, kindbom, & strain, 2005; rosen, smith, & reynolds, 2008; fareed, casarella, amar, vayalapalli, & drexler, 2009; jimenez-trevino et al., 2011). however, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology of older adults with opioid dependence, and little discussion of the models for health care delivery for this population. furthermore, there is no research to date regarding the prevalence of geriatric conditions or cognitive and physical impairments among older adults in opioid treatment. recent years have seen a nationwide increase in the proportion of older adults entering substance abuse treatment programs (arndt, clayton, & schultz, 2011). we also know that drug use patterns for older adults are changing; there has been an increase in admissions to substance abuse treatment for illicit drug use (loftwall et al., 2005; substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2010) and increased injection drug use (substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2011) for adults over the age of 50. much of what we know about individuals in opioid treatment comes from the treatment episode dataset (teds) which is collected and managed by the office ofapplied studies, substance abuse and mental health services administration. teds collects admission information for individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment facilities that receive state or federal funding. while teds captures data from the majority of treatment programs in the united states, one limitation of the teds data is that it only includes 1660 older adults in new york city opioid treatment programs 1661 information on treatment admissions, and thus may not fully capture utilization of substance abuse treatment over time. furthermore, studies that use teds data to examine aging trends are limited by defining an older adult as age greater than 50 or 55 (lofwall et al., 2005; substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2010; substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2011).while it may be reasonable to use a lower age cut off to define “geriatric” in this population given the possible association of premature mortality with drug dependence (neumark, van etten, & anthony, 2000) it may not fully demonstrate how this population is aging. given the lack of research regarding older adults with opioid dependence and the limitations of existing data, we analyzed age trends for new york city opioid treatment programs from 1996–2012, with an emphasis on older adults. our purpose was to examine age trends of adults utilizing opioid treatment programs in new york city.we also characterize basic demographic, self-reported other substance use, and self-reported physical impairments. we chose to study the treatment population in new york city because it has one of the largest methadone treatment systems in the united states and has consistently provided access to treatment in the public system. furthermore, the data collected by new york state’s office of alcoholism and substance abuse services (oasas) provides more descriptive information on the treatment population than what is available nationally through the teds dataset. materials and methods this paper presents a descriptive analysis of aging trends, characteristics, and utilization of opioid treatment programs by older adults in new york city. we used the client data system (cds), which is an administrative dataset of the new york state department of health, oasas. oasas provided aggregate data from the cds for this study. the study was exempted from irb review by the new york university school of medicine’s institutional review board, and approved by oasas. client data system the cds tracks all admissions, discharges, and updated annual status of patients in new york state licensed drug treatment programs. the cds gathers all data using a standardized form. it collects demographic information including sex, date of birth, and race or ethnicity. the cds collects information on substance use behaviors, broken down by primary, secondary, and tertiary substances used, including drugs and alcohol. other opiates besides heroin include the self-reported choices of nonprescription methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone, and other opiate/synthetics. the cds also collects information on self-reported physical impairments including hearing, sight, and mobility through yes/no questions. all data in the cds is self-reported by patients to treatment program staff, who enter it into the centralized database. data analysis included in this analysis were data for adults in opioid treatment programs, which are defined in the dataset as programs providing mmt, buprenorphine treatment, and/or psychosocial treatment for opioid dependence. data were examined for each year from 1996 to 2012. cases were limited to adults residing within the five boroughs of new york city. for each calendar year, we used aggregate data from all unique individuals who received opioid treatment services throughout that year. to be enrolled in opioid treatment services, opioid use must be reported as the primary substance used. the calculated age of individuals in the dataset was based on their age on the first day of each calendar year. for individuals who receivedmultiple services throughout the year, only the cross-sectional data from the first admission or service of the calendar year for that individual were used. demographic information is determined at the individual’s initial treatment admission and, therefore, remains the same throughout each year that they are in treatment. for example, for an individual who entered treatment in 1995, and remained in treatment continuously until 2012, their age for each year was estimated by their age on the first day of each calendar year. the individual’s other demographic information will be from the initial admission form in 1995. to ensure that data are confidential and no unique patient identifiers are released, oasas does not release data for categories having less than 10 individuals. therefore, when one category or variable had less than 10 individuals, it was determined to be too small to report, and it necessitated removing information for all categories within that group. the aggregate data was created by oasas using the default settings from sas (statistical analysis software) with the proc tabulate procedure utilized for missing values, which applied only for the physical impairment variables and did not impact other variables analyzed. other categories, such as tobacco use, were not examined because data were not collected prior to 2009, and therefore were not complete for the majority of individuals in our analysis. to examine age trends we used age groups of ≤40, 41–49, 50–59, 60–69, and ≥70. for patient characteristics including sex, race and ethnicity, primary and secondary substance used, and impairments we examined those aged 50–59, those ≥60, and all ages. results a total of 37,038 unique adult individuals received opioid treatment in new york city in 1996. over subsequent years, the treatment population increased to a peak of 40,328 adults in 2003 and since then has declined to 34,270 adults in 2012. as illustrated in figure 1, we observed a pronounced age trend in this population from 1996 to 2012, with adults aged 50 and higher becoming the majority treatment population. specifically, individuals aged 50–59 increased from 2,892 (7.8% of total patients) to 12,301 (35.9% of total patients); for patients 1662 b. han et al. figure 1. percentage of patients in nyc opioid treatment programs by age range (1996–2012). aged 60–69, there was an increase from 558 (1.5% of total patients) to 4,099 (12.0% of total patients); and for patients ≥70, an increase from 65 (0.2% of total patients) to 370 (1.1% of total patients). during the same period, those aged ≤40 decreased from 20,804 (56.2% of total patients) to 7,035 (20.5% of total patients). in 2012, those aged 50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment programs. table 1 describes the demographic characteristics of older adults in opioid treatment (age 50–59 and age >60), and of the general opioid treatment population, over time. in the older adult population, the proportion of females increased from 1996 to 2012 (a 10.7% increase in the 50–59 group and a 3.8% increase in the≥60 group).during these same years, the proportion of female patients declined in the general treatment population (a 2.8% decrease). there were also notable shifts in terms of race and ethnicity. during this period, older adults over the age of 60 were increasingly white (an increase of 10.3%) with a decrease in black patients (a decrease of 13.8%). meanwhile, for hispanics there was a small increase from 35.0% in 1996 to 38.8% in 2012. these trends, however, were different for those aged 50–59. in this age group, there were smaller decreases in both the white (3.5%) and black (5.9%) populations, and a larger increase in hispanic patients (9.2%). for all age groups, the white population remained steady (0.4%) with a decrease in black patients (3.5%) and an increase in hispanic patients (3.4%) during the same time period. substance use characteristics table 2 shows that from 1996 to 2012 the predominant primary substance used on admission for all individuals in opioid treatment programs was heroin. however, there was a small rise in the use of other opiates as the primary substance used for all age groups. table 2 also shows the prevalence of secondary substances used within each age group. the majority of patients reported use of a secondary drug. the use of cocaine was overwhelmingly the most frequently reported secondary substance. in each year, more than 30% of adults in all age groups reported upon treatment admission that they used cocaine. there were small increases during this period in all age groups of reported use of alcohol and marijuana at the time of treatment admission. self-reported physical impairments in each year, older individuals had consistently higher percentages of sight and mobility impairments compared to other age ranges. data were not available for self-reported hearing impairments for those ≥60, but there was a slight increase in those with self-reported hearing impairment for those 50–59 and all ages from 1996 to 2012. the overall percentages for hearing impairment appear similar in 2012 with 2.3% for the 50–59 age range, and 2.1% for all age groups. sight and mobility impairments increased for all age groups from 1996 to 2012. for vision impairment, there were increases for all age groups from 1.1% to 4.5% and those aged 50–59 from 2.0% to 5.3% during this same time period. vision impairment increased more for older adults with those ≥60 from 2.4% in 1996 to 6.0% in 2012. the most prevalent self-reported impairment was in mobility. for all age groups, there was an increase in mobility impairment from 2.3% in 1996 to 6.8% in 2012 and those aged 50–59 from 4.4% in 1996 to 8.6% in 2012. mobility impairment increased more for older adults with those ≥60 from 5.1% to 10.7% during this same time period. discussion contrary to popular perception, the social and health impacts of opioid dependence are not limited to younger adults, and are increasingly affecting older populations. opioid dependence is a chronic condition that often needs life-long treatment, and therefore many individuals who are currently in treatment will remain in treatment as they age. our study of adults in new york city opioid treatment programs shows a striking increase in the proportion of older patients in treatment. in 1996, the majority of adults in opioid treatment were less than 40 years of age, while in 2012, the majority age group in opioid treatment were those 50–59, with large increases in those over the age of 60. in the aging treatment population, older patients had more self-reported physical impairments. this aging trend will likely continue into the next decade. the increasing age of this population in opioid treatment programs, such as methadone treatment, may demonstrate the value of such treatment for preserving health. death rates are very high in the untreated opioid dependent population, six times that of an age-matched sample in a british study (gossop, stewart, treacy, & marsden, 2002), and data supports that methadone treatment reduces mortality (clausen, anchersen, & waal, 2008). the cds data also highlights trends in substances used by this older population in opioid treatment. there appears to be a small but consistent change in the type of primary opioid used, with increased reporting of non-heroin and prescription opioid use since 1996. there is also a high percentage of multiple drug use by older adults in older adults in new york city opioid treatment programs 1663 table 1. characteristics of

of other substances in addition to opioids may have profound affects on health and complicate treatment. the issue of polysubstance use has not been fully explored in this older population. this study also shows the diversity of the older opioid treatment population in new york city. since 1996 there have been large increases in the hispanic population receiving treatment. this highlights the need to further explore health disparities among this population, and how to culturally tailor treatment to meet the needs of different segments of the population. it is unclear, however, how representative this specific population is to other cities in the united states.arecent paper by cicero et al highlights the changing demographics of heroin users in the united states as being primarily white, younger, and living outside of large metropolitan areas (cicero, ellis, surratt, & kurtz, 2014).while there is nationwide growth of a white and younger population of current heroin users, new york city continues to serve an aging and majority non-white population in opioid treatment programs. there are limitations to this study. similar to the teds dataset, the cds data does not fully represent trends among the in-treatment population, but rather contains a cross-sectional snapshot of the older population in opioid treatment programs by year, based on their initial admission forms. therefore, these data fail to capture trends in substance use and physical impairments among those who remain in treatment over time. the cds data only captures individuals receiving treatment in state licensed specialty treatment programs. the characteristics of individuals with opioid dependence, who are receiving buprenorphine treatment in medical settings, or being treated privately, may differ from the cds population and are not represented in this study. there was a considerable amount of missing data for the physical impairment variables. data regarding selfreported hearing, sight, and mobility impairments on admission by age group, as described previously, had many missing values particularly in earlier years. in 1996 there was 14.0% missing values for self-reported hearing, sight, and mobility impairment questions. the number missing decreased every year to 2.6% missing values in 2012 for all impairment questions. however, the data indicate that older patients had increased impairments when compared to the general treatment population, in every year. another limitation of the cds data is its reliance on patient self-report, which may have recall and socialdesirability biases. the data is collected by program staff, which introduces the possibility of varying fidelity in how the questionnaire is administered. finally, the cds does not contain comprehensive information on medical comorbidities, which are captured only based on the patient’s self report and do not specify a diagnosis, or the degree of impairment. this study shows that the opioid treatment population is aging in new york city. it also highlights that there is much we do not understand about this population. the cds only provides a snapshot in time of self-reported demographic, substance use, and impairment information. most prior studies have focused on the mental health (lofwall et al., 2005) and selected chronic diseases in older adults with opioid dependence in methadone maintenance (fareed et al., 2009; maruyama, macdonald, borycki, & zhao, 2013). there have been no studies on geriatric conditions and very little research regarding the epidemiology, health status, and specific health needs, as well as inconsistent quantitative findings on comorbidities for this population (rosen, hunsaker, albert, cornelius, & reynolds, 2011). prior research indicates that medical comorbidities and health behaviors associated with prolonged substance use, including the high prevalence of co-occurring tobacco use and mental health disorders (rosen et al., 2008; fareed et al., 2009; maruyama et al., 2013) can accelerate the decline in health and contribute to frailty (d¨ursteler- macfarland, vogel, wiesbeck, & petitjean, 2011; reece, 2007). in addition, social conditions including homelessness (fischer&breakey, 1991; song, safaeian, strathdee, vlahov, & celentano, 2000), and stigma from society at large and fromwithin the health care system may also contribute fragmented medical care (gourevitch, chatterji, deb, schoenbaum, & turner, 2007; rosen et al., 2011), and poorer health outcomes. these factors may dramatically contribute to an increase in multiple chronic conditions, geriatric conditions, and a decline in function for adults with opioid dependence as they age. in order to deliver appropriate care for this aging population, it is important to understand their specific needs in terms of functional health, including cognitive and physical function and chronic disease care. long-term opioid replacement therapy with methadone is an effective treatment for patients with opioid dependence (ward, hall, & mattick, 1999). it has been shown to improve health, mental health, and socioeconomic integration (kleber, 2008), and documented long-term safety (novick et al., 1993). mmt is typically delivered through mmt programs, which have been part of the drug treatment landscape for decades. mmt programs, which aggregate an aging cohort of adults with multiple chronic conditions, and have regular and extended treatment contact longitudinally, may be optimally positioned to deliver interventions for this population. to guide more optimal treatment, using evidence-based geriatric care processes including addressing geriatric conditions (cigolle, langa, kabeto, tian,&blaum, 2007) and multiple chronic conditions (norris et al., 2008) need to be implemented for this population. future research should define the unique needs of multiple chronic disease management and how to maintain physical and cognitive function for middle-aged and older adults with opioid dependence. conclusion there is an increasing population of older adults in opioid treatment programs in new york city. this trend is likely to continue into the next decade. this study demonstrates the changing characteristics of this older population, and identifies areas that should be high priority for further 1666 b. han et al. study. these include understanding how other substance use can complicate care and how to address the changing ethnic and racial demographics of this population in new york city. much remains unknown, particularly regarding geriatric conditions and physical and cognitive function in this population. future studies are needed to better understand the specific and unique health needs of this growing population from a geriatric perspective. furthermore, new models of care are needed to address what is certain to be increasing levels of morbidity as this population ages, further emphasizing importance of integrating chronic disease management and care processes with substance abuse services. acknowledgment gail dorn, ms, and dawn lambert-wacey, ma, both of the new york state office of

lack one commonly accepted definition, have a number of distinguishing features that set them apart from other health conditions: they tend to appear in old age and are most common among vulnerable populations, have multiple causes, are many times precipitated by an acute event, can be episodic in nature and are commonly followed by a decline in functional health. common geriatric conditions include falls and gait disorders, cognitive impairment, and frailty. references arndt, s., clayton, r., & schultz, s. k.

school of medicine, new york, new york, usa; 4department of population health, nyu school of medicine, new york, new york, usa background: the population of adults accessing opioid treatment is growing older, but exact estimates vary widely, and little is known about the characteristics of the aging treatment population. further, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology, healt h status, and functional impairments in this population. objectives: to determine the utilization of opioid treatment services by older adults in new york city. methods: this study used administrative data from new york state licensed drug treatment programs to examine overall age trends and characteristics of older adults in opioid treatment programs in new york city from 1996 to 2012. results: we found significant increases in utilization of opioid treatment programs by older adults in new york city. by 2012, those aged 50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment programs. among older adults there were notable shifts in demographic background including gender and ethnicity, and an increase in self-reported impairments. conclusions/importance: more research is needed to fully understand the specific characteristics and needs of older adults with opioid dependence. keywords geriatrics, older adults, opioid dependence, methadone, geriatric conditions introduction opioid dependence is a chronic condition characterized by periods of relapse, and accompanied by physical and mental health problems and social marginalization. the aging baby-boomer cohort has high rates of substance use (patterson & jeste, 1999) that will place increasing demands and costs (rosen, heberlein, & engel, 2013) on the substance abuse treatment system, particularly for address correspondence to benjamin han, division of geriatric medicine and palliative care, new york university school of medicine, 550 first avenue, bcd 615, new york, ny 10016, usa; e-mail: benjamin.han@nuymc.org long-term treatment of opioid dependence. small studies have found that older adults in methadone maintenance treatment (mmt) have higher rates of mental health disorders along with more medical problems, and general poorer health status compared to younger patients, as well as premature mortality (firoz & carlson, 2004; lofwall, brooner, bigelow, kindbom, & strain, 2005; rosen, smith, & reynolds, 2008; fareed, casarella, amar, vayalapalli, & drexler, 2009; jimenez-trevino et al., 2011). however, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology of older adults with opioid dependence, and little discussion of the models for health care delivery for this population. furthermore, there is no research to date regarding the prevalence of geriatric conditions or cognitive and physical impairments among older adults in opioid treatment. recent years have seen a nationwide increase in the proportion of older adults entering substance abuse treatment programs (arndt, clayton, & schultz, 2011). we also know that drug use patterns for older adults are changing; there has been an increase in admissions to substance abuse treatment for illicit drug use (loftwall et al., 2005; substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2010) and increased injection drug use (substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2011) for adults over the age of 50. much of what we know about individuals in opioid treatment comes from the treatment episode dataset (teds) which is collected and managed by the office ofapplied studies, substance abuse and mental health services administration. teds collects admission information for individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment facilities that receive state or federal funding. while teds captures data from the majority of treatment programs in the united states, one limitation of the teds data is that it only includes 1660 older adults in new york city opioid treatment programs 1661 information on treatment admissions, and thus may not fully capture utilization of substance abuse treatment over time. furthermore, studies that use teds data to examine aging trends are limited by defining an older adult as age greater than 50 or 55 (lofwall et al., 2005; substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2010; substance abuse and mental health services administration, 2011).while it may be reasonable to use a lower age cut off to define “geriatric” in this population given the possible association of premature mortality with drug dependence (neumark, van etten, & anthony, 2000) it may not fully demonstrate how this population is aging. given the lack of research regarding older adults with opioid dependence and the limitations of existing data, we analyzed age trends for new york city opioid treatment programs from 1996–2012, with an emphasis on older adults. our purpose was to examine age trends of adults utilizing opioid treatment programs in new york city.we also characterize basic demographic, self-reported other substance use, and self-reported physical impairments. we chose to study the treatment population in new york city because it has one of the largest methadone treatment systems in the united states and has consistently provided access to treatment in the public system. furthermore, the data collected by new york state’s office of alcoholism and substance abuse services (oasas) provides more descriptive information on the treatment population than what is available nationally through the teds dataset. materials and methods this paper presents a descriptive analysis of aging trends, characteristics, and utilization of opioid treatment programs by older adults in new york city. we used the client data system (cds), which is an administrative dataset of the new york state department of health, oasas. oasas provided aggregate data from the cds for this study. the study was exempted from irb review by the new york university school of medicine’s institutional review board, and approved by oasas. client data system the cds tracks all admissions, discharges, and updated annual status of patients in new york state licensed drug treatment programs. the cds gathers all data using a standardized form. it collects demographic information including sex, date of birth, and race or ethnicity. the cds collects information on substance use behaviors, broken down by primary, secondary, and tertiary substances used, including drugs and alcohol. other opiates besides heroin include the self-reported choices of nonprescription methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone, and other opiate/synthetics. the cds also collects information on self-reported physical impairments including hearing, sight, and mobility through yes/no questions. all data in the cds is self-reported by patients to treatment program staff, who enter it into the centralized database. data analysis included in this analysis were data for adults in opioid treatment programs, which are defined in the dataset as programs providing mmt, buprenorphine treatment, and/or psychosocial treatment for opioid dependence. data were examined for each year from 1996 to 2012. cases were limited to adults residing within the five boroughs of new york city. for each calendar year, we used aggregate data from all unique individuals who received opioid treatment services throughout that year. to be enrolled in opioid treatment services, opioid use must be reported as the primary substance used. the calculated age of individuals in the dataset was based on their age on the first day of each calendar year. for individuals who receivedmultiple services throughout the year, only the cross-sectional data from the first admission or service of the calendar year for that individual were used. demographic information is determined at the individual’s initial treatment admission and, therefore, remains the same throughout each year that they are in treatment. for example, for an individual who entered treatment in 1995, and remained in treatment continuously until 2012, their age for each year was estimated by their age on the first day of each calendar year. the individual’s other demographic information will be from the initial admission form in 1995. to ensure that data are confidential and no unique patient identifiers are released, oasas does not release data for categories having less than 10 individuals. therefore, when one category or variable had less than 10 individuals, it was determined to be too small to report, and it necessitated removing information for all categories within that group. the aggregate data was created by oasas using the default settings from sas (statistical analysis software) with the proc tabulate procedure utilized for missing values, which applied only for the physical impairment variables and did not impact other variables analyzed. other categories, such as tobacco use, were not examined because data were not collected prior to 2009, and therefore were not complete for the majority of individuals in our analysis. to examine age trends we used age groups of ≤40, 41–49, 50–59, 60–69, and ≥70. for patient characteristics including sex, race and ethnicity, primary and secondary substance used, and impairments we examined those aged 50–59, those ≥60, and all ages. results a total of 37,038 unique adult individuals received opioid treatment in new york city in 1996. over subsequent years, the treatment population increased to a peak of 40,328 adults in 2003 and since then has declined to 34,270 adults in 2012. as illustrated in figure 1, we observed a pronounced age trend in this population from 1996 to 2012, with adults aged 50 and higher becoming the majority treatment population. specifically, individuals aged 50–59 increased from 2,892 (7.8% of total patients) to 12,301 (35.9% of total patients); for patients 1662 b. han et al. figure 1. percentage of patients in nyc opioid treatment programs by age range (1996–2012). aged 60–69, there was an increase from 558 (1.5% of total patients) to 4,099 (12.0% of total patients); and for patients ≥70, an increase from 65 (0.2% of total patients) to 370 (1.1% of total patients). during the same period, those aged ≤40 decreased from 20,804 (56.2% of total patients) to 7,035 (20.5% of total patients). in 2012, those aged 50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment programs. table 1 describes the demographic characteristics of older adults in opioid treatment (age 50–59 and age >60), and of the general opioid treatment population, over time. in the older adult population, the proportion of females increased from 1996 to 2012 (a 10.7% increase in the 50–59 group and a 3.8% increase in the≥60 group).during these same years, the proportion of female patients declined in the general treatment population (a 2.8% decrease). there were also notable shifts in terms of race and ethnicity. during this period, older adults over the age of 60 were increasingly white (an increase of 10.3%) with a decrease in black patients (a decrease of 13.8%). meanwhile, for hispanics there was a small increase from 35.0% in 1996 to 38.8% in 2012. these trends, however, were different for those aged 50–59. in this age group, there were smaller decreases in both the white (3.5%) and black (5.9%) populations, and a larger increase in hispanic patients (9.2%). for all age groups, the white population remained steady (0.4%) with a decrease in black patients (3.5%) and an increase in hispanic patients (3.4%) during the same time period. substance use characteristics table 2 shows that from 1996 to 2012 the predominant primary substance used on admission for all individuals in opioid treatment programs was heroin. however, there was a small rise in the use of other opiates as the primary substance used for all age groups. table 2 also shows the prevalence of secondary substances used within each age group. the majority of patients reported use of a secondary drug. the use of cocaine was overwhelmingly the most frequently reported secondary substance. in each year, more than 30% of adults in all age groups reported upon treatment admission that they used cocaine. there were small increases during this period in all age groups of reported use of alcohol and marijuana at the time of treatment admission. self-reported physical impairments in each year, older individuals had consistently higher percentages of sight and mobility impairments compared to other age ranges. data were not available for self-reported hearing impairments for those ≥60, but there was a slight increase in those with self-reported hearing impairment for those 50–59 and all ages from 1996 to 2012. the overall percentages for hearing impairment appear similar in 2012 with 2.3% for the 50–59 age range, and 2.1% for all age groups. sight and mobility impairments increased for all age groups from 1996 to 2012. for vision impairment, there were increases for all age groups from 1.1% to 4.5% and those aged 50–59 from 2.0% to 5.3% during this same time period. vision impairment increased more for older adults with those ≥60 from 2.4% in 1996 to 6.0% in 2012. the most prevalent self-reported impairment was in mobility. for all age groups, there was an increase in mobility impairment from 2.3% in 1996 to 6.8% in 2012 and those aged 50–59 from 4.4% in 1996 to 8.6% in 2012. mobility impairment increased more for older adults with those ≥60 from 5.1% to 10.7% during this same time period. discussion contrary to popular perception, the social and health impacts of opioid dependence are not limited to younger adults, and are increasingly affecting older populations. opioid dependence is a chronic condition that often needs life-long treatment, and therefore many individuals who are currently in treatment will remain in treatment as they age. our study of adults in new york city opioid treatment programs shows a striking increase in the proportion of older patients in treatment. in 1996, the majority of adults in opioid treatment were less than 40 years of age, while in 2012, the majority age group in opioid treatment were those 50–59, with large increases in those over the age of 60. in the aging treatment population, older patients had more self-reported physical impairments. this aging trend will likely continue into the next decade. the increasing age of this population in opioid treatment programs, such as methadone treatment, may demonstrate the value of such treatment for preserving health. death rates are very high in the untreated opioid dependent population, six times that of an age-matched sample in a british study (gossop, stewart, treacy, & marsden, 2002), and data supports that methadone treatment reduces mortality (clausen, anchersen, & waal, 2008). the cds data also highlights trends in substances used by this older population in opioid treatment. there appears to be a small but consistent change in the type of primary opioid used, with increased reporting of non-heroin and prescription opioid use since 1996. there is also a high percentage of multiple drug use by older adults in older adults in new york city opioid treatment programs 1663 table 1. characteristics of older adults enrolled in opioid

opioids may have profound affects on health and complicate treatment. the issue of polysubstance use has not been fully explored in this older population. this study also shows the diversity of the older opioid treatment population in new york city. since 1996 there have been large increases in the hispanic population receiving treatment. this highlights the need to further explore health disparities among this population, and how to culturally tailor treatment to meet the needs of different segments of the population. it is unclear, however, how representative this specific population is to other cities in the united states.arecent paper by cicero et al highlights the changing demographics of heroin users in the united states as being primarily white, younger, and living outside of large metropolitan areas (cicero, ellis, surratt, & kurtz, 2014).while there is nationwide growth of a white and younger population of current heroin users, new york city continues to serve an aging and majority non-white population in opioid treatment programs. there are limitations to this study. similar to the teds dataset, the cds data does not fully represent trends among the in-treatment population, but rather contains a cross-sectional snapshot of the older population in opioid treatment programs by year, based on their initial admission forms. therefore, these data fail to capture trends in substance use and physical impairments among those who remain in treatment over time. the cds data only captures individuals receiving treatment in state licensed specialty treatment programs. the characteristics of individuals with opioid dependence, who are receiving buprenorphine treatment in medical settings, or being treated privately, may differ from the cds population and are not represented in this study. there was a considerable amount of missing data for the physical impairment variables. data regarding selfreported hearing, sight, and mobility impairments on admission by age group, as described previously, had many missing values particularly in earlier years. in 1996 there was 14.0% missing values for self-reported hearing, sight, and mobility impairment questions. the number missing decreased every year to 2.6% missing values in 2012 for all impairment questions. however, the data indicate that older patients had increased impairments when compared to the general treatment population, in every year. another limitation of the cds data is its reliance on patient self-report, which may have recall and socialdesirability biases. the data is collected by program staff, which introduces the possibility of varying fidelity in how the questionnaire is administered. finally, the cds does not contain comprehensive information on medical comorbidities, which are captured only based on the patient’s self report and do not specify a diagnosis, or the degree of impairment. this study shows that the opioid treatment population is aging in new york city. it also highlights that there is much we do not understand about this population. the cds only provides a snapshot in time of self-reported demographic, substance use, and impairment information. most prior studies have focused on the mental health (lofwall et al., 2005) and selected chronic diseases in older adults with opioid dependence in methadone maintenance (fareed et al., 2009; maruyama, macdonald, borycki, & zhao, 2013). there have been no studies on geriatric conditions and very little research regarding the epidemiology, health status, and specific health needs, as well as inconsistent quantitative findings on comorbidities for this population (rosen, hunsaker, albert, cornelius, & reynolds, 2011). prior research indicates that medical comorbidities and health behaviors associated with prolonged substance use, including the high prevalence of co-occurring tobacco use and mental health disorders (rosen et al., 2008; fareed et al., 2009; maruyama et al., 2013) can accelerate the decline in health and contribute to frailty (d¨ursteler- macfarland, vogel, wiesbeck, & petitjean, 2011; reece, 2007). in addition, social conditions including homelessness (fischer&breakey, 1991; song, safaeian, strathdee, vlahov, & celentano, 2000), and stigma from society at large and fromwithin the health care system may also contribute fragmented medical care (gourevitch, chatterji, deb, schoenbaum, & turner, 2007; rosen et al., 2011), and poorer health outcomes. these factors may dramatically contribute to an increase in multiple chronic conditions, geriatric conditions, and a decline in function for adults with opioid dependence as they age. in order to deliver appropriate care for this aging population, it is important to understand their specific needs in terms of functional health, including cognitive and physical function and chronic disease care. long-term opioid replacement therapy with methadone is an effective treatment for patients with opioid dependence (ward, hall, & mattick, 1999). it has been shown to improve health, mental health, and socioeconomic integration (kleber, 2008), and documented long-term safety (novick et al., 1993). mmt is typically delivered through mmt programs, which have been part of the drug treatment landscape for decades. mmt programs, which aggregate an aging cohort of adults with multiple chronic conditions, and have regular and extended treatment contact longitudinally, may be optimally positioned to deliver interventions for this population. to guide more optimal treatment, using evidence-based geriatric care processes including addressing geriatric conditions (cigolle, langa, kabeto, tian,&blaum, 2007) and multiple chronic conditions (norris et al., 2008) need to be implemented for this population. future research should define the unique needs of multiple chronic disease management and how to maintain physical and cognitive function for middle-aged and older adults with opioid dependence. conclusion there is an increasing population of older adults in opioid treatment programs in new york city. this trend is likely to continue into the next decade. this study demonstrates the changing characteristics of this older population, and identifies areas that should be high priority for further 1666 b. han et al. study. these include understanding how other substance use can complicate care and how to address the changing ethnic and racial demographics of this population in new york city. much remains unknown, particularly regarding geriatric conditions and physical and cognitive function in this population. future studies are needed to better understand the specific and unique health needs of this growing population from a geriatric perspective. furthermore, new models of care are needed to address what is certain to be increasing levels of morbidity as this population ages, further emphasizing importance of integrating chronic disease management and care processes with substance abuse services. acknowledgment gail dorn, ms, and dawn lambert-wacey, ma, both of the new york state office of alcoholism and substance abuse services,

number of distinguishing features that set them apart from other health conditions: they tend to appear in old age and are most common among vulnerable populations, have multiple causes, are many times precipitated by an acute event, can be episodic in nature and are commonly followed by a decline in functional health. common geriatric conditions include falls and gait disorders, cognitive impairment, and frailty. references arndt, s., clayton, r., & schultz, s. k.
