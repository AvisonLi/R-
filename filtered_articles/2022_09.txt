growth and public revenues—can the tax mix help? bertrand achou, yann décarie, luc godbout, pierre-carl michaud, julien navaux, and suzie st-cerny* for almost 60 years, the canadian tax foundation published an annual monograph, finances of the nation, and its predecessor, the national finances. in a change of format, the 2014 canadian tax journal introduced a new “finances of the nation” feature, which presents annual surveys of provincial and territorial budgets and topical articles on taxation and public expenditures in canada. in this article, the authors address concerns about the impact that the aging of canada’s population over the coming decades could have on economic growth and, consequently, growth in government revenues. they explore how revenue-neutral changes in the tax mix today could mitigate those concerns and raise more revenue than is projected in current forecasts with a status-quo scenario. using data for quebec, the authors show that a shift in the relative share of total revenues from personal income taxes to consumption taxes could be quite effective over the next four decades. a revenue-neutral shift equivalent to 1 percent of the province’s consumption tax revenues today would result in an increase in revenues ranging between 0.3 percent and 1.0 percent by 2060, while a shift equivalent to 25 percent of consumption tax revenues would generate additional revenues of 1.4 percent to 4.8 percent. the underlying data for the finances of the nation monographs and for the articles in this journal will be published online in the near future. keywords: tax revenues n personal income taxes n consumption taxes n population aging n tax mix n quebec * bertrand achou is of hec montréal; yann décarie is of hec montréal; luc godbout is of

aged 65 and over in quebec is expected to increase from 20.5 percent in 2021 to 28.4 percent in 2040.1 the population in other provinces, in particular in the maritimes, is also aging fast. this shift could have significant economic consequences, including a slowdown in the growth of tax revenues. governments collect taxes in several ways, including through the imposition of personal income and consumption taxes. the burden of these taxes may fall differently across age groups. for example, personal income taxes are collected disproportionately from working-age taxpayers, while consumption taxes are paid more uniformly across the age distribution. hence, the effect of population aging on public revenue may ultimately depend on the relative weight of each tax as a share of total revenues. intuitively, a heavier weight for consumption taxes may mitigate the impact of population aging on public revenue. in an aging population with lower growth prospects, there is another argument for revisiting the tax mix. there is a sizable literature on the effects of the tax mix on economic outcomes. that literature focuses on differences in economic distortions and predicts better economic outcomes from a heavier use of taxes with a less distorting impact on economic activity. consumption taxes are generally considered to generate fewer behavioural distortions than personal income taxes and thus to create less of a drag on economic growth.2 at the international level, a study by arnold et al.3 looked specifically at the impact of revenue-neutral changes in the tax mix on economic growth. that study provides an empirical measure of the elasticity of long-term gross domestic product (gdp) relative to the ratio of income taxes to consumption taxes. arnold et al. found that a 1 percent shift in revenue from income taxes to consumption and property taxes would result in an increase in long-term gdp per capita ranging between 0.25 percent and 1 percent. a recent update confirmed the validity of these results while showing that a reduction in consumption taxes does co n t e n t s introduction 886 methodology 888 scenarios 889 results 890 conclusion 892

itself have a positive effect on gdp.4 in terms of canadian evidence, several studies have simulated the impact of adjusting the tax mix, in particular for quebec.5 they show that lowering income taxes and increasing consumption taxes by an equivalent amount could generate stronger economic growth and create more jobs. using a microsimulation approach and the elasticity calculated by arnold et al., this article aims to measure the potential gains for public revenue from adjustments to the tax mix. in particular, we consider an initial revenue-neutral tilt toward consumption taxes and project how this would affect future revenue. we account separately for the effect that is purely related to the age structure of the population and for the effect of the shift in the tax mix on economic growth and, ultimately, on public revenue. the tax mix shift is simulated in the context of quebec government revenues. the focus on the provincial level is justified by recent research on the consequences of population aging for government budgets. according to the parliamentary budget officer (pbo)6 and tombe,7 while the current version of the federal budget is projected to be sustainable over the long term, the majority of provincial and territorial budgets are projected to generate growing deficits.8 results show that a revenue-neutral change equivalent to 25 percent of consumption tax revenues today would result in a revenue increase ranging from 1.4 percent to 4.8 percent by 2060. sixteen percent of that increase is explained by changes in the population structure, and 84 percent is due to the effects of the new tax mix on economic growth. the cumulative revenue gains between 2020 and 2060 are expected to be very high. over that 40-year period, a shift from income taxes to consumption taxes equivalent to 25 percent of the latter would generate between 0.33 and 1.3 years of additional own-source revenue for quebec. 4 oguzhan akgun, boris cournède, and

of two modelling tools to construct our estimates. first, the demographic component is modelled with the simgen microsimulation tool.9 aggregate demographic assumptions are largely adjusted to those of the institut de la statistique du québec10 to replicate the most recent demographic projections. transitions at the individual level are modelled with a set of statistics canada databases, including the general social survey. simgen provides a projection of the population distribution by age, educational achievement, and household composition. second, the economic and public finance component is based on simfin (v.1.0.1).11 this microsimulation model uses regressions estimated with statistics canada’s social policy simulation database for the probability of employment, earnings, hours worked, consumption expenditures, non-work income, and variables to determine the effective tax rates paid for personal income taxes and consumption taxes. these profiles take into account various socioeconomic characteristics, including age and degree. figure 1 illustrates per capita tax revenue collected in quebec by age group. it considers personal income taxes and consumption taxes, which together represented nearly three-quarters of the quebec government’s own-source revenue in 2020 (40.9 percent for personal income taxes and 32.5 percent for consumption taxes).12 chart a in figure 1 shows that personal income taxes paid vary much more than consumption taxes over the life cycle. the amount of income taxes increases rapidly until age 40-45, decreases significantly until age 55-60, and falls further thereafter. compared to income taxes, consumption taxes appear to be much more stable; however, the average amount paid generally declines over the taxpayer’s lifetime. for example, among people aged 45-59, average consumption taxes are approximately one-half of personal income taxes. this ratio is then reduced to almost 1:1 for 65-69-year-olds, and the initial ratio is reversed at older ages. consider the following equation: r it = σ a = 0 85+ r ita ´ pop at 9 an overview of simgen and a link to more detailed documentation can be found at research chair in

in this equation, the aggregate value (r) of revenue (i ) at a given year (t) is the sum for all ages (a) of per capita revenue ( r ia t ) multiplied by the population ( popa t ). chart b in figure 1 shows that population growth is much stronger for ages at which per capita consumption taxes are higher than income taxes. between 2020 and 2060, the share of the population aged 20-69 should increase by 5 percent, while the share of the population aged 70+ should more than double (+101 percent) over the period. thus, in the long term, population aging should have the effect of reducing the growth of income taxes collected more than the growth of consumption taxes. scenarios to estimate the potential effects of a new tax mix, quebec’s public finances are first projected without changing the current tax structure. this reference scenario is then compared with two alternative scenarios. in the first alternative scenario, consumption taxes are increased in 2020, and this increase is offset by an equivalent reduction in personal income taxes in that year. figure  per capita consumption and personal income taxes paid to the quebec government, by age group, 2020, and population by age

890 n canadian tax journal / revue fiscale canadienne (2022) 70:4 this scenario does not consider any impact of the new tax structure on economic growth. public revenues are then projected to 2060 by maintaining this initial readjustment without modifying any other assumptions. the difference in tax revenue compared to the reference scenario is therefore explained solely by a change in the demographic structure. in the second alternative scenario, the modification of the tax mix is the same as in scenario 1 but the effect on economic growth is now integrated into the model. the elasticity of gdp growth to fiscal changes is based on the results obtained by arnold et al.13 they estimate that a shift of 1 percent of total revenue from income taxes to consumption and property taxes would increase gdp per capita in the long run by (depending on the empirical specification) 0.25 percent (the lower bound) to 1 percent (the upper bound).14 in this scenario, the effect on gdp growth is spread over 10 years, reaching its full impact in 2030. for both scenarios, two levels of rebalancing intensity are simulated. the lower level corresponds to a 1 percent increase in consumption tax revenues for 2020—that is, $203 million (“rebalancing of 1 percent”), and the higher level corresponds to an increase in consumption tax revenues of 25 percent for 2020—that is, $5.1 billion (“rebalancing of 25 percent”). in all cases, personal income taxes change by an amount equal to the increase in consumption taxes, so that the rebalancing has no effect on government revenue in 2020. results figure 2 shows the projected effects of the new tax mix on the quebec government’s own-source revenue over the 40-year period (2020-2060). in scenario 1, where no effect on gdp is included, the gain from a rebalancing of 1 percent would be equal to $2 million in 2030 (in constant 2020 dollars) and would reach $14 million in 2060. in the case of a rebalancing of 25 percent, the gain would be equal to $53 million in 2030 and $353 million in 2060, representing an increase of 0.05 percent to 0.2 percent in quebec’s own-source revenue, compared to the reference scenario. these gains are explained by the changes in population structure by age (figure 1, chart b), 13 supra note 3. 14 in the context of this study, the impact of the new tax mix on public finances is limited to the quebec government’s own-source revenue. however, the elasticity measured by arnold et al. (supra note 3) is based on general government tax revenues. therefore, in our study, a shift of x percent in total revenue accounts for x percent of all the levies imposed in quebec, whether by the federal government, the provincial government, local authorities, or the quebec pension plan/canada pension plan, so that the elasticity is calculated in relation to the total burden on quebec taxpayers. for the aggregates used in our study, see cffp, supra note 12, at 24, table 4. furthermore, while the modification of the tax mix in arnold et al. involves a simultaneous and proportional increase in consumption and property taxes, only consumption taxes are increased in our rebalancing simulations, and this could bias the results. however, if such bias exists, its effect will be negligible given the relative weights of consumption taxes ($28,166 million) and property taxes ($436 million) in 2020, according to the cffp, supra note 12. finances of the nation n 891 combined with the distribution of consumption and income taxes by age (figure 1, chart a): the increase in the share of the population aged 70+ corresponds to an increase in the share of the population for whom per capita consumption taxes paid are higher than per capita income taxes. taking into account the effect on gdp growth in scenario 2 strongly increases the effect of rebalancing on public revenue. as a reminder, the effect on gdp growth is spread over 10 years; this explains the sharp rise observed for scenario 2 in figure 2 at the beginning of the analyzed period. in 2060, the effect of a rebalancing of 1 percent ranges from $408 million (in constant 2020 dollars) at the lower bound (an increase of 0.3 percent in own-source revenue compared to the reference scenario) to $1,572 million at the upper bound (an increase of 1.0 percent in own-source revenue). the effect of a rebalancing of 25 percent ranges between $2,163 million (an figure  impact of modifying the tax mix on the

in own-source revenue). the cumulative revenue gains between 2020 and 2060 are potentially very high: a rebalancing of 1 percent could result in a gain ranging from 7.1 percent (at the lower bound) to 27.5 percent (at the upper bound) of quebec’s own-source revenue in 2060, while the gain from a rebalancing of 25 percent could range from 35.5 percent to 129.6 percent of quebec’s ownsource revenue in 2060, thus representing 0.33 to 1.3 years of additional own-source revenue. the significant difference in the results for scenarios 1 and 2 is explained by the fact that all the taxes collected by the quebec government apply in scenario 2 to a rate of growth in gdp that is accelerated because of the rebalancing. with the current tax mix, real per capita gdp is projected to increase by 10.5 percent by 2030 (table 1). with a rebalancing of 1 percent, the projected increase in real per capita gdp would be 0.2 to 1.0 points higher by 2030 than the increase given the current tax mix (depending on whether we use the lower or the upper bound estimates of arnold et al.). with a rebalancing of 25 percent, the increase would be 1.0 to 4.1 points higher. in addition to the tax revenue generated by the demographic effect of the rebalancing, we calculate the impact of higher economic growth on tax revenue. thus, the combined effect on revenue growth in 2060 is $2,163 million for a rebalancing of 25 percent with the lower-bound impact on gdp, which breaks down into two parts: $353 million (16 percent of the total effect) resulting from demographic changes and $1,810 million (84 percent of the total effect) stemming from the effect on per capita gdp. the effect of the rebalancing resulting from the change in the structure of the quebec population therefore generates only one-fifth of the additional tax revenue projected to result from the effect of the rebalancing on gdp growth. conclusion a revenue-neutral shift from personal income taxes to consumption taxes could generate significant revenue for provincial and federal governments. in this article, we have evaluated the impacts for the quebec government. a rebalancing equivalent to 1 percent of consumption taxes in 2020 would result in an increase in revenue of between $408 million and $1,572 million in 2060. such a rebalancing would generate cumulative gains between $11.5 billion and $44.7 billion in constant 2020 value over the 40 years of simulations. a rebalancing of 25 percent would generate gains between $57.8 billion and $210.6 billion. at an aggregate level, the return on a change in the tax mix is potentially large, given the difficulty of raising new revenue, particularly in provinces with a high level of taxation, such as quebec. obviously, there are a few equity issues that need to be dealt with when changing the tax mix. changing how we raise future taxes also changes who pays those taxes. some groups will pay less while others will pay more, leading to intergenerational transfers as well as transfers within generations. for example, retirees may see their future tax bill increase while current younger workers may see theirs decrease. however, these intergenerational concerns are mitigated by two considerations. first, the additional revenue raised can be targeted in ways that take into account those on finances of the nation n 893 whom the additional burden falls. for example, future health-care services are potentially constrained by inadequate financing that may disadvantage future retirees. a change in the tax mix would generate new resources that could be targeted to improving services for that group. far from exacerbating existing intergenerational transfers from young to older taxpayers, a change in the tax mix can reduce such transfers. but whatever one’s views on intergenerational transfers, the change in the tax mix generates more economic growth, the proceeds from which can be used to undo new implicit transfers. within generations, the change in the tax mix can also be regressive, since personal income taxes are probably more progressive than consumption taxes.15 however, it is possible to offset most of those effects by compensating lower-income taxpayers using various tools, including existing goods and services tax and provincial sales tax credits.16 overall, we think that this is a policy idea worthy of serious consideration: a change in the tax mix can dampen the effect of population aging on public revenue, and it is a way for both federal and provincial/territorial governments to generate additional revenue in the long run without imposing immediate costs on taxpayers. table 1 projected increase in quebec’s real per capita gdp, 2020-2030, by scenario (current tax mix, rebalancing of 1 percent,
