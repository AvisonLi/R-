two-stage nested theil decomposition; esda; spatial econometric models; china 1. introduction the united nations (2017) noted that population aging is a dynamic process by which the proportion of the elderly population is increasing in the total population. it is an inevitable trend in the population due to factors such as decreased fertility and increased life expectancy and migration when the social economy develops to a certain stage [1]. for more than half a century, the number and proportion of the elderly population have been increasing all over the world, and this trend of an aging population structure a ects both developed and developing countries. since the implementation of the strict family planning policy in the late 1970s, china‚Äôs total population fertility rate has decreased rapidly, and the natural population growth and total population have been e ectively controlled [2,3]. simultaneously, the age structure has begun to transition from concentrating on adults to the elderly. in the year 2000, china became an aging society, with the proportion of the elderly population (65 years old and above) exceeding 7% for the first time. it took less than 40 years for china‚Äôs population age structure to make this change, while it tookwestern/developed countries half a century or more to complete. this rapid aging process will have a profound impact on the economic and social environment in china. the economic impact on consumption is mainly reflected in the e ects of consumption and savings on capital formation, and the impact on production is reflected in labor supply and human capital sustainability 2019, 11, 5959; doi:10.3390/su11215959 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability sustainability 2019, 11, 5959 2 of 20 accumulation [4]. with regard to the social environment, population aging will have various e ects on health care, the employment system, the pension insurance system, urban housing and transportation, and old-age service facilities [5]. furthermore, the regional development imbalance associated with population development factors and socioeconomic characteristics has become a major feature of china‚Äôs population aging. in view of this, studying the evolution of the spatial di erences of china‚Äôs population aging and its driving factors is conducive to identifying the geographical characteristics of china‚Äôs population aging and provides a reference for narrowing regional di erences, reducing unfavorable socioeconomic impacts and formulating reasonable population development strategies and policies. with the development of industrialization, modernization, and urbanization after the second world war, developed countries took the lead in completing the modern transformation of population reproduction from high birth and high death rates to low birth and low death rates. the population age structure also changed from young to old. some scholars have begun to explore the health problems of the elderly and the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by aging from the perspective of biology and medicine [6‚Äì8]. in the 1970s, geographers interested in aging broadened the understanding of the spatial issues of population aging due to advances in geography, and explored the spatial distribution of the elderly, the dynamic changes in the distribution over time [9‚Äì11], and the problems urban living spaces create for the elderly [12‚Äì14]. during this period, several scholars summarized the research on the geography of aging and the research directions that needed to be expanded [15‚Äì18]. in particular, harper and laws (1995) theoretically summarized the framework of positivism, empiricism, and humanistic epistemology that applied by geography to population aging and emphasized the mutually beneficial relationship between social theory in human geography and gerontology [18]. schwanen et al. (2012) and skinner et al. (2015) spoke highly of their review, noting it as a milestone in the study of the geography of population aging [19,20]. since the publication of harper and laws‚Äôs review, whether at the global, national, or urban‚Äìrural scale, the spatial imbalance of population aging at various spatial scales has increasingly interested policy makers and scholars. from a global perspective, relevant research has focused on the di erences and the spatial temporal evolution of population aging according to aging rates and the elderly population size. research has also considered aging trends, measured by the average annual growth rate of aging across continents, countries, and regions, and has predicted the development of future trends in major countries or regions around the world [21,22]. at the national level, the related research has focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of population aging within developed countries, with earlier and more severe aging in europe, north america, oceania, and asia, in countries such as the uk, italy, the usa, canada, australia, and japan [23‚Äì28]. with regard to the study of aging in urban and rural areas, relevant scholars have mainly explored two microscopic directions, namely, the spatial distribution pattern of urban and rural elderly populations and the di erent types of aging communities formed by the impact of population aging on urban and rural residential space [29‚Äì33]. in particular, scholars in the emerging field of geography in china began to explore the spatial issues of china‚Äôs aging population in the late 1990s. although the related research started late, scholars inherited the research paradigms of developed countries for the exploration of the spatial and temporal distribution of the elderly population and the regional di erences in population aging from di erent spatial scales, such as provinces, important economic regions, and metropolitan areas [34‚Äì42]. scholars of the geography of population aging also consider the factors a ecting population aging and its spatial inequality. the trend of population aging is usually manifested by the contraction of the young group and the expansion of the elderly group in the total population, and the direct causes of these two situations are the lowered birth rate and extended life expectancy (or reduced death rate) [27]. therefore, most scholars believe that the reduction of birth rate and death rate or the extension of life expectancy during the demographic transition were the main drivers of the aging process and the spatial di erences in the vast majority of developed countries around the world [23,27,29,41]. in addition, when both mortality and fertility drop to extremely low levels, population migration sustainability 2019, 11, 5959 3 of 20 naturally becomes a key factor that has also received widespread attention. large-scale international and domestic migration can promote the transformation of the age structure of a country or region, although international migration has little impact on population aging in most countries [1,41,42]. conversely, domestic migration, especially of young people seeking better education and employment opportunities by moving from areas with relatively backward social and economic strength, such as declining industrial bases and rural areas, to more active and growing capital cities or urban cores, is a particularly important factor contributing to the acceleration of population aging in the sending areas [26,29,43‚Äì45]. most of the above research is based on the spatial unit of the state (province) and city (metropolitan area) and even the community scale to explore the regional di erences and spatial distribution of population aging. however, it is dicult to clearly describe the spatial characteristics of china‚Äôs population aging and the spatial di erences in detail using the state or province as the spatial unit because of the large scale. likewise, the use of the city or metropolitan area or the community scale as the spatial unit cannot reveal the macroscopic factors of the national pattern due to the limitations of the research unit. moreover, previous studies have not e ectively measured the spatial di erences in population aging at multiple spatial scales. therefore, this study takes the prefecture-level administrative unit between the provincial and county levels as the research object and applies a two-stage nested theil decomposition to comprehensively consider and systematically decompose the spatial inequality of population aging at various levels in china, which more clearly reflects the spatial di erence of china‚Äôs population aging and e ectively overcomes the shortcomings of the above macroand microscale. in addition, previous studies on the factors influencing population aging mostly proceeded from the three aspects of birth rate and mortality change during the demographic transition and population migration, ignoring the impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors. however, the demographic transition and population migration are closely related to socioeconomic factors such as economics, health care, education, and urbanization, as well as environmental factors [46,47]. although individual scholars have used the traditional econometric method to examine the impact of economic and environmental factors on population aging [38], they have neglected the spatial dependence and heterogeneity of population aging among regions, which cannot accurately reflect the impact of various factors on population aging. thus, based on the above research deficiencies, this paper examined the spatial di erences and influencing factors of the population aging of 337 prefecture-level units in china. the structure of this paper is as follows: first, the two-stage nested theil decomposition method was used to measure the di erences in china‚Äôs population aging. second, spatial statistical methods were used to further explore the evolution of the spatial distribution and spatial correlation pattern of china‚Äôs population aging. third, considering spatial dependence and heterogeneity, spatial econometric models were used to empirically examine the impact of demographic, socioeconomic and natural environmental factors on population aging in china and its regions. fourth, the necessary discussion on the empirical results was presented. finally, the corresponding conclusions and targeted countermeasures were summarized. 2. materials and methods 2.1. study area according to the constitution of the people‚Äôs republic of china, china‚Äôs administrative structure is divided into four levels: provincial administrative districts, prefecture-level administrative districts, county-level administrative districts, and township-level administrative districts. furthermore, in order to reflect the economic and social development of various regions in china, the chinese economic geography circle divides the above four-level administrative units with similar economic development levels and relatively uniform geographic locations into four economic zones. these are eastern china, central china, western china, and northeast china, and they are regional units at the highest level of the economic division, below the national level and above the provincial administrative unit level. sustainability 2019, 11, 5959 4 of 20 because the prefecture-level administrative units play an irreplaceable role in regional economic and social development, promoting regional coordination and maintaining national stability, this paper selects all the prefecture-level administrative units (337 in total) as basic research units except for the hong kong and macao special administrative regions, and taiwan province due to the relevant data limitations. in addition, based on the abovementioned criteria for the division of administrative divisions and economic divisions in china, the 337 prefecture-level administrative units selected in this paper belong to china‚Äôs four major economic zones and 31 provincial administrative units. in the end, this paper combines four economic zones and 31 provincial administrative units as aliated research units, and, together with all prefecture-level administrative units, comprehensively explores the spatial di erences and influencing factors of china‚Äôs population aging from a multiscale perspective (figure 1). sustainability 2019, 11, x for peer review 4 of 20 economic zones. these are eastern china, central china, 146 western china, and northeast china, and 147 they are regional units at the highest level of the economic division, below the national level and 148 above the provincial administrative unit level. 149 because the prefecture-level administrative units play an irreplaceable role in regional 150 economic and social development, promoting regional coordination and maintaining national 151 stability, this paper selects all the prefecture-level administrative units (337 in total) as basic 152 research units except for the hong kong and macao special administrative regions, and taiwan 153 province due to the relevant data limitations. in addition, based on the abovementioned criteria for 154 the division of administrative divisions and economic divisions in china, the 337 prefecture-level 155 administrative units selected in this paper belong to china‚Äôs four major economic zones and 31 156 provincial administrative units. in the end, this paper combines four economic zones and 31 157 provincial administrative units as affiliated research units, and, together with all prefecture-level 158 administrative units, comprehensively explores the spatial differences and influencing factors of 159 china‚Äôs population aging from a multiscale perspective (figure 1). 160 161 figure 1. administrative division map of china. 162 2.2. variable selection 163 the classical demographic transition theory describes the trend of population reproduction 164 from the traditional pattern of high birth rate and death rate to the modern pattern of low birth rate 165 and death rate: the decline in birth rate and death rate during this process has led to a shift in the 166 age structure from youthful to aging [46,48]. as the birth rate continues to decline, especially in 167 some european countries, the total fertility rate falls below the replacement level and falls into the 168 ‚Äúlow fertility trap,‚Äù while the influx of international immigrants has become an important factor 169 affecting population growth in these countries. therefore, some scholars have included population 170 migration in the analytical framework of the classical demographic transition theory, and proposed 171 the second demographic transition theory, thus completing the integration of factors such as birth 172 rate, death rate, and population migration that affect population growth, and further perfecting the figure 1. administrative division map of china. 2.2. variable selection the classical demographic transition theory describes the trend of population reproduction from the traditional pattern of high birth rate and death rate to the modern pattern of low birth rate and death rate: the decline in birth rate and death rate during this process has led to a shift in the age structure from youthful to aging [46,48]. as the birth rate continues to decline, especially in some european countries, the total fertility rate falls below the replacement level and falls into the ‚Äúlow fertility trap,‚Äù while the influx of international immigrants has become an important factor a ecting population growth in these countries. therefore, some scholars have included population migration in the analytical framework of the classical demographic transition theory, and proposed the second demographic transition theory, thus completing the integration of factors such as birth rate, death rate, and population migration that a ect population growth, and further perfecting the classic demographic transition theory [49,50]. it can be seen that the birth rate, death rate, and population migration are the direct causes and determinants of population aging. sustainability 2019, 11, 5959 5 of 20 the demographic transition theory also reflects how the type of population reproduction is developed from a low to a high level with the advancement of social economic modernization, and the intrinsic link between population reproduction and social economic development [48]. that is to say, the coordinated development of the economy and society, the advancement of science and technology, the development of urbanization, and the institutional changes in the process of modernization are the driving mechanisms of demographic transitions, thus indirectly a ecting population aging. for example, the improvement of the economic development level and medical and health conditions can prolong life expectancy and promote the migration of the population from underdeveloped areas to developed areas; the advancement of science and technology means the improvement of human capital input factors; and an important means of human capital formation is the improvement of education, which leads to the improvement of population quality structure, making people more inclined to fewer births and eugenics; the process of urbanization is accompanied by the transfer of the rural population to urban areas, realizing the transformation from a traditional to a modern lifestyle and concept of childbearing, so that people pay more attention to the quality of the birth rather than to the number of births, thereby reducing the birth rate; the institutional changes in the modernization process are mainly manifested in the government‚Äôs introduction of mandatory legal policies to reduce the birth rate, especially the comprehensive and strict family planning policy implemented by the chinese government, which has led to an unprecedented decline in china‚Äôs fertility rate since the 1970s. furthermore, regardless of social and economic development, human survival and development are restricted by the natural environment, and the population shows distinct regional characteristics, while the elderly population is more susceptible to environmental factors and has higher requirements for environmental quality due to physiological limitations. normally, the quality of the natural environment is conducive to human health and increases the life expectancy of the population, which indirectly a ects population aging. for example, a high greening level and good air quality can create a high-quality environment, ensure people‚Äôs safety and health, and increase the life expectancy of the population, thus a ecting the local population aging. based on the demographic transition theory and previous empirical research, we believe that the evolution of population aging is the result of a combination of demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and natural environmental factors. the aging population ratio can reflect the absolute population aging and is the most frequently used indicator [23‚Äì25,33,41]. therefore, we selected the aging population ratio (the proportion of the population aged 65 and over to the total population) to reflect china‚Äôs population aging and to be a dependent variable for the model of population aging factors. as independent variables, we selected the birth rate (bir), death rate (der), in-migration rate (imr), and out-migration rate (omr) to characterize the factors of natural population change and migration. the per capita gdp (eco), per capita years of education (edu), number of hospital beds per 1000 people (med), and proportion of nonagricultural population (urb) were used to characterize the impact of the economy, education, medical conditions, and urbanization on population aging. concurrently, as a multiethnic country, china‚Äôs population is composed of the main ethnic han and the remaining 55 legal minority populations; the relatively loose family planning policies among the minority populations make them have a higher birth rate than the main ethnic han, so the proportion of the remaining 55 ethnic minorities except for the han nationality (fpp) were used to characterize the impact of family planning policy di erences on population aging. we also selected the green coverage rate (gcr) and air quality index (aqi) to represent the impact of natural environment indicators such as greening level and air quality on population aging. 2.3. methods 2.3.1. two-stage nested theil decomposition method the theil index is a special form of the generalized entropy index system, which was first proposed by theil in 1967 and is now widely used to measure spatial inequality [51‚Äì54]. unlike other sustainability 2019, 11, 5959 6 of 20 indicators that measure spatial inequality, the theil index can be decomposed and is an excellent tool for estimating the degree of inequality in countries with multiple levels of administrative divisions, such as china [54]. since this paper considered three administrative division scales, the regional, provincial, and prefectural levels in china, it is more suitable to apply the two-stage nested theil decomposition method proposed by takahiro akita in 2003 [52]. this indicator can decompose the national overall inequality into between-region, between-province, and within-province di erences. the decomposition process is presented below. first, the overall national population aging inequality t, based on the prefecture-level administrative unit, can be measured by the following formula: t = x i x j x k   lijk l ! log   lijk/l pijk/p ! , (1) where lijk and pijk represent the elderly population and the total population of prefecture k in province j in region i, respectively; l and p represent the overall national elderly population and the total population. second, if we define tij as the inequality in province j in region i and ti as the inequality in region i, then ti can be decomposed into the following form: tij = x k   lijk lij ! log   lijk/lij pijk/pij ! (2) ti = x j x k   lijk li ! log   lijk/li pijk/pi ! = x j   lij li ! tij+ x j   lij li ! log   lij/li pij/pi ! = twi + tpi, (3) where lij and pij represent the elderly population and the total population in province j in region i, respectively; li and pi represent the elderly population and the total population in region i, respectively; and twi and tpi measure the within-province inequality and the between-province inequality in region i, respectively. finally, combining all of the above formulas, we can express the overall national di erences t as follows: t = p i  li l  ti + p i  li l  log  li/l pi/p  = p i  li l  ti + tbr = p i  li l  twi + tpi  + tbr = p i  li l  twi + p i  li l  tpi + tbr = twp + tbp + tbr (4) where twp is the within-province component, and tbp and tbr represent the between-province and between-region components of the national overall inequality, respectively. equation (5) is the final expression of the two-stage nested theil decomposition method equation and can comprehensively reflect the multiscale inequality of population aging in china. 2.3.2. exploratory spatial data analysis exploratory spatial data analysis (esda) is a series of techniques for describing and visualizing spatial distribution, identifying atypical locations or spatial outliers, discovering spatial association patterns, clustering or hotspots, and suggesting spatial systems or other forms of spatial heterogeneity; spatial autocorrelation or spatial correlation is the core concept and universally applied method of exploratory spatial data analysis [55,56]. spatial autocorrelation measures the correlation between variables in georeferenced space, which is the matching phenomenon between location similarity and attribute similarity [57,58]. this method mainly uses two tools, global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial autocorrelation. global spatial autocorrelation is used to analyze the overall clustering characteristics of spatial data in the whole system and is generally measured by moran‚Äôs i and geary‚Äôs sustainability 2019, 11, 5959 7 of 20 c [58]. local spatial autocorrelation can test whether there are similar or disparate value aggregations in local areas, which makes up for the deficiency of global spatial correlation in testing the overall clustering, usually measured by local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (lisa), gi, and moran scatter plot [55,59]. moran‚Äôs i was the first method proposed and the most common for testing global spatial clustering, and is expressed as follows: moran0s i = n np i=1 np j=1 wij(yiÙÄÄÄy)(yjÙÄÄÄy) np i=1 np j=1 wij(yiÙÄÄÄy) 2 = pn i=1 pn j,i wij(yi ÙÄÄÄ y)(yj ÙÄÄÄ y) s2 pn i=1 pn j,i wij , (5) where n is the total number of prefecture-level units; yi and yj are the attribute values in units i and j. y and s2 represent the mean and variance of all attribute values, respectively; wij represents the elements of the spatial weighting matrix wij in row i and column j based on the queen adjacency form, that is, if there are common sides or vertices between the two research units, then wij = 1 is defined; otherwise wij = 0. moran‚Äôs i values range from ÙÄÄÄ1 to 1. i > 0 and i < 0 indicate a positive or a negative spatial autocorrelation between each unit. i = 0 means there is no spatial autocorrelation. as an important tool for local spatial autocorrelation, lisa recognizes the spatial heterogeneity exhibited by di erent types of spatial clustering or outliers. it indicates obvious local agglomeration (high‚Äìhigh or low‚Äìlow) and local dispersion characteristics (high‚Äìlow or low‚Äìhigh) in light of four types of spatial distribution. its calculation formula is as follows: ii = (yi ÙÄÄÄ y) s2 x j wij(yj ÙÄÄÄ y), (6) where ii represents the degree of association between the local unit i and its neighboring units. a positive ii indicates that a high value is surrounded by high values (high‚Äìhigh) or a low value is surrounded by low values (low‚Äìlow). a negative ii indicates that a high value is surrounded by low values (high‚Äìlow) or a low value is surrounded by high values (low‚Äìhigh). 2.3.3. spatial econometric method in a relatively open system, spatial elements may interact and depend on each other because they flow between spatial boundaries, and location and distance influence spatial features caused by spatial boundaries [60]. spatial econometric models capture the spatial dependence of elements in di erent units by embodying the spatial weighting matrix in the spatial lag term and the spatial error term, which results in more convincing model estimates than traditional econometric models based on the assumption that the error terms are independent of each other [61]. typically, two spatial econometric models with interaction e ects are used to explain the correlation of observations at a particular location with observations at another location [62]. the first is the spatial lag model (slm), which reflects that the local dependent variable depends on the dependent variables in the adjacent units in the interaction process. it explains the spatial dependence caused by interactions such as spatial di usion and spatial overflow to some extent. the model is as follows: y =
