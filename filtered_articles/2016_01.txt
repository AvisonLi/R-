(2002) extend kerkhofs and lindeboom (1997) study to other indices such as the mini-mental state  examination (mmse) test on cognitive ability, the center for epidemiological studies-depression  (ces-d) test of depressing feelings, and others, and apply fe methods to dutch data different  from that of kerkhofs and lindeboom (1997).2) charles (2004) is also one of the first investigations  that analyze the causal effect of retirement on health focusing on subjective well-being (swb) in  economic literature by using instrumental variables (ivs).      additionally, there are numerous other papers that study the effect of retirement on various  health indexes (e.g., bound and waidmann, 2007; coe and lindeboom, 2008, dave, rashad, and                                                      2   spasojevic, 2008; neuman, 2008; johnston and lee, 2009; latif, 2011; coe and zamarro, 2011;  kajitani, 2011; behncke, 2012; bonsang, adam, and perelman, 2012; mazzonna and peracchi,  2012; hernaes et al., 2013; bingley and martinello, 2013; hashimoto, 2013; insler, 2014; kajitani,  sakata, and mckenzie, 2014; hashimoto, 2015; kajitani, sakata, and mckenzie, 2016). there are,  however, no unified views on the impact of retirement on various health indexes. while some studies  conclude that retirement has a positive impact on health defined as mental or physical health, other  studies conclude that retirement has no or negative effect. additionally, these results depend on  characteristics such as gender and education.     the goal of this paper is to explain why the effect of retirement on health estimated results in the  previous studies differ. one of the keys to understanding these differences is a better understanding  of the path through which retirement influences health. if there is an important link between  retirement and health (i.e., a mechanism through which retirement influences health outcomes),  the effect of retirement on health could be heterogeneous. in fact, some researchers focus on the  change in the health investment behaviors after retirement to explain why the effect of retirement  on health estimated results in the previous studies differ (e.g., zhao, konishi, and noguchi, 2013;  ayyagari, 2014; insler, 2014; eibich, 2015; motegi, nishimura, and terada, 2016). eibich (2015)  is the first study to clearly point out the importance of the mechanism to explain the difference in  the effect of retirement on health. on the other hand, we investigate the differences by focusing on  the analysis methods. there is no study to focus on the analysis methods to explain why the effect  of retirement on health estimated results in the previous studies differ.3) the contribution of this  paper is to provide two verification frameworks to examine which factor causes these differences.  we will discuss which factor causes the difference in the estimated results by the previous studies.     according to our analysis, the analysis method is one of the determinants of these differences.  by choosing an analysis methodology, we also comprehensively reexamine the effect of retirement on  health in eight countries. we analyze five health indexes, such as self-reported health, depression,  cognitive function, body mass index (bmi), and activities of daily living (adl). we examine the  five health indexes by using the same analysis method. by doing so, we show the comprehensive  results of the effect of retirement on health.                                                      3       the rest of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews preceding studies; section 3  discusses the data; section 4 examines why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health  in previous studies differ from each other; section 5 performs harmonized analysis on the effect of  retirement on health; and section 6 concludes this paper and discusses future research scope.    2    literature review      this section summarizes related studies, focusing on economic literature. as such, we introduce  studies that examine the effect of retirement on health. the study by kerkhofs and lindeboom  (1997) is one of the first to suggest an endogenous decision linking retirement and health regarding  the effects of retirement on health. using a fixed effects (fe) method, they find that, in the  netherlands, the hscl health index can be improved after early retirement. lindeboom et al.  (2002) examined other measurement scales, such as mmse and ces-d, with fe methods, using  dutch data. charles (2004) also conducted an early investigation analyzing the causal effects of  retirement on health by focusing on swb and through iv. psychological and psychiatric literature  boasts a large body of research on the correlation of retirement and swb, but has paid scant  attention to causal effects. 4)      furthermore, rohwedder and willis (2010), who investigated the effects of retirement on cogni-  tive abilities and compared micro data across the usa, the uk, and 11 european countries, found  a negative influence of retirement on cognitive abilities. they suggest that institutional differences  across countries, such as pensions, taxes, and disability policies, are also important in explaining  the differences in health outcomes across countries. as such, rohwedder and willis (2010) gave an  impetus to research on the effect of retirement on cognitive abilities, making possible studies such  as those by bonsang et al. (2012), mazzonna and peracchi (2012), coe et al. (2012), and bingley  and martinello (2013). additionally, numerous other studies assessed the effects of retirement on  other aspects of health.   5)   finally, tables a.2.1, a.2.2, a.2.3, and a.2.4 in section a.2 show a  summary of relevant studies, chosen based on the following criteria:      • we chose all papers analyzing the effect of retirement on health that have been published by        november 2015. we used google scholar to identify these research papers.                                                     4       • we choose all working papers that have more than 50 citations on google scholar by november        2015.      we restrict our analysis to only papers in economics, thus excluding literature on public health.  in tables a.2.1, a.2.2, a.2.3, and a.2.4, we show the category of health outcome, method, the  definition of retirement, control variables information, dataset, the method of sample selection, and  the surveyed country. here, “positive” means the positive impact on a health status (better after  retirement), “negative” means a negative impact worse after retirement, and “no” means no impact.  according to tables a.2.1, a.2.2, a.2.3, and a.2.4, there is no unifying result in all health indexes  except the health index, which only a few studies analyze. numerous studies analyze ces-d,  self-report of health, adl, and cognitive functioning. according to tables a.2.1, a.2.2, a.2.3, and  a.2.4, the datasets such as the hrs, the share and the elsa have been frequently used. the  fixed effects method or the iv method have been typically used as the analysis method. according  to tables a.2.1, a.2.2, a.2.3, and a.2.4, many studies suggest that cognitive function decreases after  retirement. in addition, many studies suggest that self-report of health improves after retirement.  however, there is no agreement in other health indexes.      we consider why they obtain different results. we also add bmi to the analyzed indexes,  although only two studies in our list use it. this is because we comprehensively analyze the effect  of retirement on health indexes. in the appendix a.2, we show the other indexes on illness. however,  this paper does not focus on the health indexes of illness.    3    data      this paper uses the health and retirement study (hrs) 6) and other related datasets, such  as the english longitudinal study of ageing (elsa), the health survey for england (hse), the  survey of health, ageing, and retirement in europe (share), and the japanese study of ageing  and retirement (jstar). these are panel surveys of individuals 50 or older. these family datasets  are constructed so that the questions in the hrs family studies are as similar to the original ques-  tions in the hrs as possible. they include a rich variety of variables to capture living aspects in  terms of economic status, health status, family background, as well as social and work status. we                                                    5   subsequently explain all health indexes used.    cognitive score: we use the cognitive function score in the hrs and other related datasets. in  the hrs, we use the immediate word recall scores (first half of the word recall test), delayed word  recall (second half of the word recall test), 7) and word recall summary score (immediate word recall  plus delayed word recall). the word recall summary score is between 0 and 20. the immediate  word recall and delayed word recall tests ask the respondent to recall as many words as possible  from a list of 10 words. the score of immediate word recall and delayed word recall is the number  of words from the 10-word list that were recalled correctly.  self-report of health: in the hrs, there is a variable that indicates self-reported health conditions.  the variable measures the categories of health self-reports as excellent, very good, good, fair, poor.  the health categories are numbered from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). in all related datasets, the  same variable is present. we convert the five values into two health statuses, poor health or not  poor health. additionally, in the elsa and the share, we can use another scale of self-assessed  health: very good, good, fair, bad, and very bad. we also define the health self-report index of  “bad health.” 8)  adl: this variable measures the change in the index for adl. in the hrs and other related  datasets, all respondents are asked to answer questions such as “because of a health or memory  problem do you have any difficulty with bathing or showering?” we use this information when  calculating the adl score.  depression: in the hrs, there is a question targeting whether a respondent has symptoms of  depression. for example, one of the statements is “much of the time during the past week, you  felt depressed.” we use these questions when we calculate the ces-d score. in the hrs and  other related datasets, there are similar questions. additionally, we use another depression scale,  euro-d, which is available in all version of the share. we mainly use the euro-d scale in the  share because the ces-d scale is only available in waves 1 and 2 of the share.  bmi: in the hrs and other related datasets, all respondents are asked to provide their weight and  height, and bmi is calculated using this information. we use the value of bmi and create a dummy                                                      6   variable that takes the value 1 if the respondent’s bmi value is greater than or equal to 30.        we summarize all scores and values of these health indexes in tables 1 and 2. in table 1, we  show the descriptive statistics of the age group above 50 in all countries and the descriptive statistics  for the usa in table 2. according to table 1, the scores and values are not at the same level in  all countries, bmi in the us being higher than in other countries. in table 2, we can observe  characteristics of the cognitive function. females have a higher score than males in the word recall  summary score. highly educated individuals have higher overall cognitive scores.      in section 5, we perform a dynamic analysis for selected countries. we utilize both the pension  eligibility age and the long-term variation of retirement behavior. moreover, we choose the analyzed  countries based on the availability of information regarding pension eligibility age. we mainly  use the harmonized datasets.     9)   however, when our preferred variables are not available in the  harmonized datasets, we use the variables of the original datasets. in table 3, we show a summary  explaining which dataset we use in section 5 of this paper.      more importantly, we use the pensionable age when we calculate our ivs. we explain this point  in appendix (a.1), while in section 5, we use only the pensionable age confirmed to be correct.    4     critical literature assessment  4.1   targeted literature      our goal is to explain why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health in previous  studies differ. we investigate the difference by focusing on the research framework. first, we create  pairs of related studies for each health index, based on the following criteria:       • step 1: we choose papers from tables a.2.1, a.2.2, a.2.3, and a.2.4.      • step 2: we can replicate them by using the hrs, related studies (the global aging data),        and the hse.      • step 3: we choose only published papers in health economics or labor economics.                                                      7      • step 4: we choose only published papers that estimate a linear model to analyze the effect of        retirement on health.     • step 5: we choose published papers in journals with higher impact factor as much as possible.     based on these criteria, we choose the studies in table 4, which we use in the next sections. we  show how these criteria determine which paper we analyze in appendix (a.3). in the subsequent  section, we explain how we analyze why the effect of retirement on health differs.   4.2   verification framework 1     having chosen the targeted studies, we first analyze the effect of the difference in each factor on  the final results. each study consists of certain factors, such as surveyed country, analysis method,  retirement definition, etc. (see table 4). these studies use various identification strategies, analysis  methods, and definitions of retirement. as such, we analyze why the estimated results of the effect  of retirement on heath in previous studies differ by focusing on the differences in these factors. in  each pair of studies, we first replace only one factor (e.g., the estimation method), as shown in  figure 1. in section 4.3, we replace all the factors, one by one in the paired studies. in section 4.2,  by replacing only one factor, we analyze the effect of each factor on the difference in the estimated  results. there are five characteristics in each study: “index,” “def. of retire,” “controls,” “method,”  “sample,” and “survey country.” the differences in these characteristics explain the different results  on the effect of retirement on health. the details of these characteristics are as follows.     • index: characteristics of the index used (e.g., ces-d versus euro-d);     • def. of retire: definition of retirement (e.g., retired for at least one year versus not working        for pay);     • controls: what the researchers include as control variables (e.g., only family structure vari-        ables versus family structure variables + economic variables);     • method: analysis method (e.g., fe methods versus iv methods);     • sample: sample selection method (e.g. only male versus full sample);                                                     8      • survey country: surveyed country (e.g., the usa versus france).      here, we summarize our results.     • the sensitivity of replacing the definition of retirement is not strong.     • the sensitivity of replacing the analysis method is not weak. in almost all indexes, the       estimated results change when replacing the analysis method.     • the sensitivity of replacing the surveyed country is also significant.     • the difference in the estimated results cannot be explained by only one-factor replacement.     in this section, by replacing only one factor, we have checked the sensitivity of each factor on  the estimated results. we explain the details of this procedure by using an example in the results  section (cognitive score). we show detailed results, except for the “cognitive score” of the  verification framework 1 in section a.4. according to our results, it is difficult to explain why the  estimated results are different by replacing only one factor. in the next section, we provide another  framework to explain why the estimated results in the previous studies differ.     in the appendix (a.5), we summarize the replication and replacement notes in this section.  when we replicate and replace the analysis of related literature, we make some adjustments if  needed (see section a.5 for details).    cognitive score (bonsang et al. (2012) versus coe and zamarro (2011)):     • table 5 shows the result replacing each factor from bonsang et al. (2012) to those in coe and       zamarro (2011) and from coe and zamarro (2011) to those in bonsang et al. (2012). the       upper panel implies how the estimated results will change if we replace either the definition       (def. of retire), the set of control variables (controls), the analysis method (method), sample       selection method (sample), or the surveyed country (survey country) in bonsang et al. (2012)       with the one in coe and zamarro (2011). when we replace all factors at the same time, the       result in bonsang et al. (2012) (-1.036) is replaced with the one in coe and zamarro (2011)       (-0.120). in the method replacement from bonsang et al. (2012) to coe and zamarro (2011),                                                   9         we only replace fe-iv (the method in bonsang et al. (2012)) with iv (the method in coe        and zamarro (2011)). in all health indexes, we perform the same analysis.     • according to table 5, when transplanting one factor from bonsang et al. (2012) to coe        and zamarro (2011), the replacement of the surveyed country yields the opposite results        (negative-positive) and vice-versa. however, the sensitivity of replacing the control variables        and the surveyed country are important.   4.3   verification framework 2     in the previous section, we have discussed the sensitivity of each factor on the estimated re-  sults. we have also found that there are multiple factors that explain why the estimated results are  different. in this section, we propose another framework to explain why the estimated results are  different. as such, we start from one study and arrive at another study, replacing factors one by one  (see figure 2). if the source of the difference in the effect of retirement on health exists, the result  will change after we change this source as per figure 2. we discuss the results in the following.  as in verification framework 1, we explain the details of this procedure by using an example in the  results section (cognitive score).    cognitive score (bonsang et al. (2012) versus coe and zamarro (2011)):     • table 6 shows the result for replacing factors one by one from bonsang et al. (2012) to those in        coe and zamarro (2011) and from coe and zamarro (2011) to those in bonsang et al. (2012).        for example, in pattern a of table 6, we first replace “method,” “controls’,’ and “country”        from bonsang et al. (2012) to those in coe and zamarro (2011). in the second replacement,        we further replace “def. of retirement.” finally, we replace “sample.” we perform the same        analysis in all health indexes.     • in table 6, we combine method, controls, and country, as these are the factors producing the        change in the results in review 1. we consider that these factors are important for explaining        the difference in the effect of retirement on health between two different studies. the figure                                                     10        on the left shows the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing       the block (method + controls + country). on the other hand, the right-hand figure shows       the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the retirement       definition. we compare these cases as follows.     • in all patterns (a, b, c), we observed that the estimated results change after replacing the       block (method + controls + country) (negative → no)(left-hand figure). on the other hand,       we do not observe any change just after replacing the definition of retirement (right-hand       figure).  self-report of health (dave et al.

(2008) versus neuman (2008)):     • in table 8, we show the same procedure as in table 6. the left-hand figure shows the change       in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block (method + controls),       as these factors (method + controls) produce the change in the results in review 1. on the       other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change in the estimation results when we change       the order of replacing the retirement definition. we compare these cases as follows.     • in all patterns, changing both the estimation method and the difference in what the researcher       uses as control variables produce a change in the results. in particular, in pattern c (left-hand                                                   11        figure), the change in method + controls produces the opposite impact for female samples.       in patterns a and b, “sample” is also significant. the estimated results changes just after       replacing “sample” (no → no (male) and positive (female))(left-hand figure). as such, the       definition of retirement seems to have no impact on the results (right-hand figure).  depression (dave et al. (2008) versus coe and zamarro (2011)):     • in table 9, we show the same procedure as in table 6. the left-hand figure in figure 9 shows       the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block (method       + controls), as these factors (method + controls) produce the change in the results in review       1. on the other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change in the estimation results when       we change the order of replacing the retirement definition. we compare these cases as follows.     • in all patterns (a, b, c), we observe that the estimated results change after replacing the block       (method + controls) (negative → no). in pattern d, “country + index” is also significant. the       estimated results changes just after replacing “country + index” (negative → no)(left-hand       figure). on the other hand, we do not observe any change just after replacing the retirement       definition (right-hand figure).  bmi (johnston and lee (2009) versus godard (2016)):     • in table 10, we show the same procedure as in table 6. the left-hand figure in table 10       shows the change in the estimation results when we change the order of replacing the block       (method + controls + sample), as these factors (method + sample) produce the change in       the results in review 1. on the other hand, the right-hand figure shows the change in the       estimation results when we change the order of replacing the index. there is no difference in       the definition of retirement between johnston and lee (2009) and godard (2016). here, we       replace the index, and compare these cases as follows.     • in all patterns (a, b), we observe that the estimated results change after replacing the block       (method + controls + sample) (negative → no). in patterns c and d, “country” is also signif-       icant. the estimated results changes just after replacing “country” (negative → no)(left-hand                                                    12        figure). on the other hand, we do not observe any change just after replacing the index except       for pattern a (right-hand figure).     finally, we summarize our results.      • the choice of the estimation method seems to be the key factor for explaining the difference       in the estimation results in all indexes. additionally, the use of control variables is also       important. what the researcher uses as control variables is also included in all health indexes.       in all health indexes, the estimation method plus other factors (e.g., method + controls)       changes in the estimation result.     • the influence of the difference in the surveyed country is also important for explaining the       difference in the effect of retirement on health.     • changes in the definition of retirement have a lower impact.      according to our results, the difference in the estimation method is a key factor in explaining  why the estimated effects of retirement on health in preceding studies differ. it is intuitive that the  sensitivity of the surveyed country chosen is strong. however, we do not consider this as problematic.  on the other hand, a strong sensitivity of the analysis method choice is problematic because it is  possible that we do not appropriately estimate the effect of retirement on health, depending on the  choice of the analysis method. in some studies, it is possible that there remains room for further  improvement. for example, coe and zamarro (2011) estimate the effect of retirement on cognitive  function by using cross-sectional data. they use the exogenous variation of the pensionable age as an  iv, the share being their data source. as such, we can use a dynamic variation of the retirement  behavior in the share. dave et al. (2008) only use fe and do not use an iv. consequently, we  can use the fe-iv method, often used in recent studies to estimate the effect of retirement on  health indexes. for example, bonsang et al. (2012), insler (2014) and godard (2016) use the fe-iv  method to estimate the effect of retirement on health.                                                       13   5     harmonized analysis of the effect of retirement on health  5.1   analysis framework      here, we use the fe-iv estimation method and estimate the impact of retirement on certain  health indexes for eight countries. coe and zamarro (2011) estimate the effect of retirement on  cognitive function by using cross-sectional data, and use the cross-country variation of pensionable  age to control for retirement endogeneity, using share. however, we use a dynamic variation of  the retirement behavior, and control for retirement endogeneity by using the pensionable age in the  surveyed countries. we also estimate the effect of retirement on health indexes for each country.  while dave et al. (2008) only use fe, we use the fe-iv method to estimate the effect of retirement  on health indexes as follows:10)                                  health indexit = β0 + β1 retireit + γ ′ xit + a1i + λ1t + ǫ1it        (1)                                                                                      fb                                    retireit = α0 + α1 1{ageit ≥ aeb                                                                  i } + α2 1{ageit ≥ ai }                                                      fb          +α1 1{ageit ≥ aeb                                         ′                         i } · ageit + α2 1{ageit ≥ ai } · ageit + η xit + a2i + λ2t + ǫ2i          (2)                                           aeb                                           i : the early retirement benefit eligibility age                                            afi b : the full retirement benefit eligibility age   where retireit is an indicator which is equal to 1 when a respondent retires at period t. we use two  retirement definitions. the first is “not work for pay,” which means that a respondent is retired if  he/she is not working for payment. the second definition is “complete retire,” which is the same  retirement definition of dave et al. (2008). λ1t and λ2t are time fe; a1i and a2i are individual fe;  xit are control variables at period t. we restrict the sample to those aged above 50.      our identification strategy utilizes the fact that the proportion of retired elderly in many devel-  oped countries starts to increase dramatically after the pensionable age. pension eligibility age is  exogenous. the incentive to retire from the labor market increases after the exogenous pensionable  age. however, the pension eligibility threshold does not directly influence health status, but while                                                       14   it increases the incentive to retire form the labor market. we exploit this fact to identify the effect  of retirement on health. 11) as such, we use dummy variables (e.g., {ageit ≥ aeb                                                                               i } ) and the cross  terms between the dummy variable and age (e.g., {ageit ≥ aeb                                                           i } · ageit ) to identify changes in retire-  ment after the pensionable age. we analyze only countries where pensionable age is confirmed to be  correct (the usa, the uk, germany, france, denmark, switzerland, czech, estonia, japan, china,  and korea), and discuss how to confirm each pensionable age in appendix (a.1). for the countries  included in the share, we analyze only the surveyed countries included in the first wave (austria,  belgium, switzerland, germany, denmark, spain, france, greece, italy, netherlands, sweden, and  israel) because we utilize enough dynamic variation of retirement and health indexes. we use the  uk, denmark, france, germany, switzerland as the european analyzed countries.     figure 3 shows the proportions of retired elderly by age by pooling all samples. in figure 3,  the pensionable age is represented by the red line. in the us, the uk, denmark, france, germany,  switzerland, japan (male), and south korea, there is a sharp increase in the proportion of retired  around the pensionable age. in the us, denmark, france, germany, and switzerland, around the  early retirement age, there is also a sharp increase in the proportion of retired elderly. in the  uk, japan (male) and south korea, there is a sharp increase in the proportion of retired elderly  around the normal retirement age. additionally, after the early retirement age, the slope of the  proportion of the retired elderly changes in many countries. as a result, we use the cross term  (e.g., {ageit ≥ aeb                  i } · ageit ) to identify this movement. in the next section, the first stage results are  presented as to check the validity of our strategy. eibich (2015) uses a similar strategy to exploit the  discontinuity of retirement status around the pensionable age. furthermore, we control individual  demographics (xit ), including variables to control the age effect. around the pensionable age, it is  possible that there is a change in individual demographics. as such, we control for these effects.   5.2   the results     we discuss the estimated results only when the coefficients of iv in the first stage are significant.  we also test the endogeneity of retirement with the durbin-wu-hausman test. when we do not  reject the null hypothesis, we support the results of fe model. we use the retirement definition                                                       15   of “not work for pay” in all countries except korea and japan. on the other hand, in korea and  japan, we use the retirement definition of “complete retire.” this is because, in korea and japan,  we do not obtain a significant result in the first stage regression by using the retirement definition  of not work for pay. we perform a robustness check with respect to the retirement definition in the  next section. with respect to depression, we use both ces-d and euro-d, and identify which scale  we use in the analysis (e.g., us (ces-d(0-8), denmark (euro-d)). the total score of ces-d is  seven or eight. on the other hand, the total score of euro-d is 20. we use euro-d in the european  countries because the sample size is larger when we use euro-d. the first stage results are shown  in table 11.12)      • as per table 12, in each health index, only korea has an opposite effect compared to the       us. 13) with respect to self-reported health and ces-d, in half of the surveyed countries, we       observe a positive effect of retirement on health. however, only in korea and the us there is       a significant effect on cognitive function. nonetheless, there is an opposite effect (positive or       negative) between these countries.     • as per table 13, there is a negative effect or no effect of retirement on bmi (bmi: negative       = increase and positive = decrease). however, in half of the surveyed countries, there is a       positive effect of retirement on adl.     • summarizing the estimated results (table 12 and 13), in the us, we observe a change in health       outcomes after retirement for almost all health outcomes. bmi increases after retirement in       the us. with respect to poor health, ces-d and adl summaries, health outcomes improve       after retirement, as do in the uk. on the other hand, in denmark, france, germany, and       japan, almost all health outcomes remain constant after retirement. in switzerland, no health       outcome changes after retirement.     • summarizing the results by gender (table 12 and 13), with respect to poor health, ces-d       and adl summaries, in the us and uk, the coefficients are similar for both elderly males       and females. in these countries, health outcomes improve after retirement for both elderly       males and females. regarding the ces-d summary, the magnitude of the coefficient is large                                                   16         (-2.435) for elderly japanese males, and their ces-d summary improves after retirement.        additionally, bmi increases after retirement, and the magnitude of the coefficient is large        (2.796) in japan.     • in subjective indexes, such as the self-report of health and depression, the index improves        in many countries, while the health self-report index worsens only in korea. with respect        to objective indexes, such as bmi and adl, bmi increases or remains constant and adl        improves or remains constant.      subsequently, we check the sensitivity of the retirement definition and the pattern of control  variables on the effect of retirement on health. we prepare two retirement definitions (“not work for  pay” and “complete retire”) and four control patterns (“pattern 1,” etc.). according to table 14, in  most analyzed countries and patterns, the estimates are robust, although we change the retirement  definition and control variable patterns for each country regardless of health outcomes. the results  are sensitive depending on the definition of retirement in denmark (pattern 4, adl) and germany  (pattern 4, health self-report). the results are not significant for some countries, but there is no  opposite effect. in table 14, we show only the final results after performing the dwh test, by  choosing fe or fe-iv.   5.3   discussion     we summarize our main results in table 15. our analysis method (fe-iv) is established in this  section. according to table 15, when we fix our analysis method, we find a few of opposite results  (positive or negative effects) (health self-report, cognition). for each health index, we obtain positive  (negative) or no effects of retirement on health in all surveyed countries. the important point is that  there is heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health, even if we fix our method and control for  retirement endogeneity. heterogeneities depending on the surveyed countries cannot be explained  by the differences in the analysis method. it is possible that these differences can be explained  by the heterogeneity of the health investment behavior change after retirement. consequently, we  should investigate the relationship between the heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health                                                       17   observed in many countries and the heterogeneity of the change in health investment behaviors after  retirement. eibich (2015) discusses this point solely for germany.    6    conclusion      we summarize the results of this study as follows.       • review 1:          – the sensitivity of replacing the definition of retirement is not strong.          – the sensitivity of replacing the analysis method is not weak. in almost all indexes, the             estimated results change when replacing the analysis method.          – the sensitivity of replacing the surveyed country is also significant.      • review 2:          – the choice of the estimation method seems to be the key factor for explaining the dif-             ference in the estimation results in all indexes. additionally, what the researcher uses             as control variables is also important. in all health indexes, the estimation method             plus other factors (e.g., method + controls) changes the estimation result. what the             researcher uses as control variables is also included in all health indexes.          – the influence of the difference in the surveyed country is also important for explaining             the difference in the effect of retirement on health.          – changes in the definition of retirement have a lower impact.       we summarize our main results in table 15, and fix our analysis method (fe-iv) in section 5.  according to table 15, when we fix our analysis method, we obtain comparatively stable results.  however, there is heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health even if we fix our methods  and control for the endogeneity of retirement. as such, future work could answer on why is there  heterogeneity of the effect of retirement on health among different countries. it is possible that the  change in health investment behaviors after retirement is an important factor for explaining these                                                     18   heterogeneities. future work can investigate the relationship between the heterogeneity of the effect  of retirement on health observed in many countries and the one of the change in health investment  behaviors after retirement.

bureau of labor statistics in each  country. however, this information is not available for some countries. subsequently, we contact the  bureau of labor statistics or bureau of statistics directly, and obtain the information if possible. if  we cannot find any information in the previous step, we use the oecd pensions at a glance, social  security programs throughout the world (europe, asia and the pacific, and the americas) and the  eus mutual information system in social protection (missoc) as data sources. however, we  cannot obtain the detailed pension eligibility age for many countries. finally, the correct pension  eligibility ages are obtained for the usa, the uk, germany, france, denmark, switzerland, czech,  estonia, japan, china, and korea. we do not consider countries where this information is missing.  in this paper, we analyze the usa, the uk, denmark, france, germany, switzerland, japan and  korea. we show the pension eligibility ages used in this paper, as per the

(2008) → coe and zamarro (2011)    (method)      •since dave et al. (2008) use the fe estimation, they do not use the ivs. therefore, when applying iv estimation to      dave et al.

(2012) analyze the usa and the data collection periods roughly overlap.      •we use age and age squared instead of the age dummy when we use the iv estimation. there is a multicollinearity      between the ivs (takes the value 1 after a respondent reaches pensionable age) and the age dummy when applying the      iv estimation. coe and zamarro (2011) → dave et al.

(2014) and insler (2014) are representative papers. furthermore, recently review papers have been published       on the impact of retirement on health in other fields. for example, van der heide et al. (2013) put retirement in the       public health context, whereas wang and shi (2014) took up retirement in a psychological context.  6)       see the website at (http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu) for more details on hrs.  7)       there are two rounds in the word recall tests. in the first round (immediate word recall), there is a test to recall       the number of words as much as possible. after a while, the second round starts. in the second round (delayed word       recall), a respondent is asked to recall the same words as much as possible.  8)       “bad health” is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if respondents assess their health as fair, bad, and very bad,       and 0 otherwise.  9)       the gateway to global aging data (http://gateway.usc.edu) provides harmonized versions of data from the interna-       tional ageing and retirement studies (e.g., hrs, elsa, share, klosa). all variables of each dataset have the same       items and follow the same naming conventions. the harmonized datasets enable researchers to conduct cross-national       comparative studies. the program code to generate the harmonized datasets from the original datasets is provided       by the center for global ageing research, usc davis school of gerontology and the center for economic and social       research (cesr). this code is used to input some variables, such as measures of assets and income. 10)       all models are estimated using the stata module xtivreg2. see schaffer (2010) for further details. 11)       bonsang et al. (2012), latif (2013), zhu and he (2015), zhu (2016), zhu (2016) and godard (2016) exploit a similar       identification strategy. 12)       for germany and denmark (except for females), we use only the dummy variables (e.g. {ageit ≥ aeb                                                                                                     i } ).  13)       the full results, including control variables, are available on request. 14)       we also change the index of depression (from ces-d to euro-d) when we change the surveyed country.                                                                      54
