degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent lower back pain. although adipose-derived stem cell (adsc)-based therapy is regarded to be promising for the treatment of degenerated np, there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant adscs into the np while maintaining cell function. in this study, we developed a type ii collagen/chondroitin sulfate (cs) composite hydrogel-like adsc (ccsa) delivery system with genipin as the crosslinking agent. the induction effect of the scaffold on adsc differentiation was studied in vitro, and a rat coccygeal vertebrae degeneration model was used to investigate the regenerative effect of the ccsa system on the degenerated np in vivo. the results showed that the ccsa delivery system crosslinked with 0.02% genipin was biocompatible and promoted the expressions of np-specific genes. after the injection of the ccsa system, the disc height, water content, extracellular matrix synthesis, and structure of the degenerated np were partly restored. our ccsa delivery system uses minimally invasive approaches to promote the regeneration of degenerated np and provides an exciting new avenue for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. statement of significance nucleus pulposus (np) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent lower back pain. stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method in np regeneration, but there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant adscs into the np while maintaining cell function. in this study, we developed a type ii collagen/chondroitin sulfate (cs) composite hydrogel-like adsc (ccsa) delivery system with genipin as the cross-linking agent. although several research groups have studied the fabrication of injectable hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works. we chose type ii collagen and cs, the two primary native components in the np, as the main materials and combined them according to the natural ratio of collagen and sgag in the np. the delivery system is preloaded with adscs and can be injected into the np with a needle, followed by in situ gelation. genipin is used as a cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low cytotoxicity. we investigated the stimulatory effects of our scaffold on the differentiation of adscs in vitro and the regenerative effect of the ccsa delivery system on degenerated np in vivo.  2018 acta materialia inc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. 1. introduction intervertebral disc (ivd) degeneration and consequent lower back pain affect approximately 80% of people at some point in their lives [1]. the ivd consists of three major components: the inner nucleus pulposus (np), the outer annulus fibrosus, and cartilage https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.03.019 1742-7061/ 2018 acta materialia inc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. ⇑ corresponding author. e-mail

homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/actabiomat endplates [2]. the np is a highly hydrophilic substance, which contributes to the flexibility of the spinal column and load-bearing capacity of the ivd [3]. the degeneration of np caused by extracellular matrix (ecm) loss is thought to be the cause of ivd degeneration [4]. stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method for np regeneration. bio-scaffolds are essential to transplant stem cells into specific locations and create an appropriate microenvironment [5]. scaffolds fabricated by synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid [6], polycaprolactone [7], and polyethylene glycol [8] have good mechanical properties, but have poor cell adhesion without surface modification. additionally, the ivd is an avascular tissue and exchange of substances in this area is difficult [9]; thus, the synthetic polymers and their degradation products are not easy to remove. the accumulation of foreign substances may aggravate the suboptimal microenvironment in the ivd and reduce the ph and oxygen concentration, thereby inhibiting cell survival [10]. the principle of a bio-scaffold is to emulate the biological environment of the local tissue [11], and from this point of view, the acellular np scaffolds seem to be a good choice. however, decellularization can cause matrix loss and denaturation [12]. additionally, allogeneic np tissues are difficult to obtain. these disadvantages limit the use of acellular np scaffolds. the np contains an amorphous matrix of highly hydrated proteoglycans embedded in a loose network of collagen [13]. proteoglycans consist of a protein core modified by sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sgag). chondroitin sulfate (cs) is the most important sgag in the np and enables the np to withstand substantial compressive loads by attracting water [14,15]. the most abundant collagen type in the np is type ii collagen [16], which gives the disc its form and tensile strength [13]. several studies have demonstrated that the ratio of sgag to hydroxyproline in the normal np is approximately 27:1 [17], and the hydroxyproline content is equivalent to 10% of the weight of collagen [18]. using type ii collagen and cs, we can fabricate a scaffold with better biological properties. injectable scaffolds can mostly avoid the degeneration of the ivd structure during the transplant; hence, hydrogel scaffolds composed of type ii collagen and cs are adequate. an ideal hydrogel would have low viscosity during injection followed by in situ gelation, deliver cells, fill micro and macro fissures, and restore disc height [19]. cross-linking is the most common approach to stabilize the biomaterials [20,21]. in addition, the gelation velocity of many hydrogel scaffolds is regulated by cross-linking. the most widely used cross-linking treatments can be mainly divided into two types: chemical and physical. physical cross-linking methods such as photo-cross-linking can result in toxicity to the cells being delivered [22]. chemical cross-linking is applicable in fixing ecmderived scaffolds and the agents are mainly classified as chemical and natural agents. glutaraldehyde and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (edc) are representative chemical agents, and they effectively increase the mechanical stability of bio-scaffolds. however, the toxicity and induced calcification of these agents limit long-term implantation [23,24]. genipin is obtained from the natural compound geniposide, which is extracted from the fruit of the gardenia jasminoides ellis plant [25]. genipin has low toxicity and is regarded as a natural crosslinking agent; the cross-linking processes are controllable and subtle and products are stable [25,26]. type ii collagen/cs composite scaffolds have already been reported in previous studies [27,28]. however, these studies focused on fabricating three-dimensional porous scaffolds and the usage of toxic chemical cross-linking agents limits the construction of the cell delivery system. genipin at proper concentrations provides the possibility of fabricating a cell-mixed type ii collagen/cs composite hydrogel, which has no cytotoxicity towards the delivered cells. adipose-derived stem cell (adsc) is a kind of stem cell that is derived from the adipose tissues. adscs have the ability to differentiate into different kinds of cells in specific environments; hence, they are widely used in stem cell-based tissue engineering [29,30]. our previous study has demonstrated that adscs can be guided to differentiate into an np-like phenotype with the stimulation of type ii collagen [31]. similar conclusions have also been reported by other researchers [32]. thus, adscs are suitable seeding cells in our type ii collagen/cs composite hydrogel-like cell delivery system. in the current study, we chose type ii collagen and cs, the main components of a healthy np, and combined them at a specific ratio according to ecm composition of the np. a suitable concentration of genipin was used to cross-link the adsc mixed type ii collagen/ cs hydrogel. we aimed to fabricate an np-like injectable cell delivery system based on type ii collagen and cs, investigating its biological effects on adscs in vitro and verifying its regenerative effects on degenerated ivds. we hope our study will provide new insights into stem cell-based tissue engineering and the construction of a ecm-based injectable cell delivery system. 2. materials and methods 2.1. cell culture sprague–dawley (sd) rat adscs bought from cyagen biosciences (rasmd-01001; guangzhou, china) were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution under static conditions in a humidified incubator at 37 c with 5% co2. the culture medium was completely replaced every 3 days, and cells from passages 4–6 were then harvested for subsequent experiments. 2.2. scaffold preparation the type ii collagen/cs composite hydrogel-like adsc (ccsa) delivery system was prepared by the following steps: first, 6 mg/ ml type ii collagen (chicken sternal cartilage; sigma aldrich, usa) and 20 mg/ml cs (sigma aldrich) were mixed on ice, and 0.1 m naoh, 10x pbs, and dmem were used to adjust the ph to approximately 7.2. then, a suspension of adscs in dmem was added into the mixed solution to a final concentration of 3 mg/ ml type ii collagen, 8.1 mg/ml cs, 1x pbs, and 2 * 106/ml adscs [33]. the blank type ii collagen/cs composited hydrogel (ccs) was prepared by the same method except without adscs. various concentrations of genipin (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 1% w/v; aladdin, china) dissolved in 75% etoh were added into the gel forming solution for subsequent cross-linking. 2.3. cytotoxicity assay the cytotoxicity of genipin cross-linked scaffolds was determined after 3, 7, and 14 days of cultivation. the supernatant of each group was collected and tested for lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) content. the ldh assay kit (jiancheng bioengineering institute, china), by following the manufacturer’s protocol, was used to determine the ldh content. absorbance values were detected at 440 nm to reflect the ldh content. 2.4. cell proliferation the cck-8 assay kit (dojindo molecular technologies, japan) was used to detect cell proliferation. adscs were cultured for 3, 7, and 14 days before determination. at each time point, the complete med- x. zhou et al. / acta biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 497 ium was replaced with 200 ml of prepackaged cck-8 solution (180 ml of dmem and 20 ml of cck-8). each group was incubated at 37 c under 5% co2 for 4 h, and then 150 ml of the supernatant was collected and measured by reading the absorbance values at 450 nm using a model 680 microplate reader (bio-rad, usa). 2.5. gene and protein expression analyses the ccsa delivery systems were allowed to form gels in 12-well plates, and equal amount of adscs cultured as a monolayer were served as the control. all the groups were cultured in np cells inductive differentiation medium (dmem supplemented with 5 mg/ml of transferrin, 5 mg/ml of selenous acid, 0.1 mm dexamethasone, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mm proline, 1.25 mg/ml bsa, 5 mg/ml insulin, 0.17 mm ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 10 ng/ ml tgf-b3, and 10 ng/ml igf-1) [34]. the expression levels of target genes (table 1) were determined after 7 and 14 days of treatment. total rna was extracted using the rnaiso reagent (takara bio, japan), followed by reverse transcription utilizing the prime- scripttm rt reagent kit (takara bio). mrna was analyzed using the steponeplus real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, ca, usa) and sybr green (takara bio). the housekeeping gene was 18s rrna, and all of the primers were synthesized by sangon biotech (shanghai, china). the results were calculated using the 2ddct method. protein analysis was carried out after 21 days of treatment. the total protein in each group was extracted in ripa buffer containing 1% pmsf, and the concentration was measured by the bca method. proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (millipore, ma, usa). the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (tbst) at room temperature for 1 h and were hybridized overnight at 4 c in tbst with the appropriate primary antibody: sox9 (1:1000, abcam, uk), acan (1:1000, abcam), col1 (1:1000; abcam), col2 (1:5000; abcam), or gapdh (1:5000; santa cruz, usa). then, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000; santa cruz) for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. the relative protein levels were quantified by densitometry using quantity one software (bio-rad laboratories inc., munich, germany). 2.6. microstructure before microstructure observation with scanning electron microscopy (sem; su8010, hitachi, japan), samples were frozen at 80 c and lyophilized for 24 h. then, all samples were mounted onto aluminum stubs with carbon tape and sputter coated with a thin gold film (emitech, k550) to avoid electrical charging. 2.7. in vitro biodegradation the stability of scaffolds was determined by measuring the biodegradation in vitro using bacterial collagenase and chondroitinase abc at a concentration of 10 and 0.4 u/ml without the disturbance of cells [35]. two hundred microliters of ccs with or without cross-linking by 0.02% genipin were immersed in 1 ml of enzymatic digestion solution for up to 24 days. the complete medium after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 days of incubation was collected for the next measurement. the hydroxyproline content was detected to reflect the type ii collagen biodegradation using the hydroxyproline assay kit (jiancheng bioengineering institute, china). the cs biodegradation was detected by the 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (dmmb) assay [36], and the standard curve was prepared with cs. 2.8. evaluation of the degree of cross-linking a ninhydrin assay was performed to determine the degree of cross-linking, as previously described [37]. briefly, 1 ml of ninhydrin solution (170 mg of ninhydrin and 30 mg of hydrindantin dissolved in 20 ml of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether) was added to the samples and incubated in a boiling water bath for 15 min. the reacted ninhydrin solution was then cooled to room temperature and diluted in 60% ethanol. the optical absorbance of the solutions at 570 nm was recorded using a model 680 microplate reader (bio-rad). the cross-linking degree was calculated using the following equation: cross - linking degree ¼ 1  odðcross - linkedþ odðnon - cross - linkedþ  100% 2.9. determination of the viscoelastic properties the viscoelastic

total of 800 ml of sample was loaded onto the stage and the upper plate was lowered up to a 1 mm gap. strain amplitude sweep mode was chosen, and a sweep strain from 0.01% to 100% at constant frequency (1 hz) was performed. the storage modulus (g0) and loss modulus (g00), which represent the energy stored and dissipated, respectively [38,39], during the shear process were recorded. the temperature of tests was controlled at 37 c. to determine the gelation time of the ccsa delivery system, 800 ml of sample was loaded on the stage with 1% strain at constant frequency (1 hz) at 37c. the change in g0 and g00 was recorded every 30 s for a duration of 30 min. the gelation time was determined at the time point when the g0 curve intersected the g00 curve [40]. 2.10. animal and surgical procedures sd rats weighting 150 g were used for the in vivo experiments. all the animals were obtained from the animal center of the academy of medical science of zhejiang province, and all procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of zhejiang university. the surgical procedures had already been reported in our previous study [41]. anesthesia was administered by intraperitoneal injection with 1% pentobarbital sodium. the coccygeal vertebrae (co)7/co8 and co8/co9 were located by digital palpation and confirmed by a trial radiograph. a 20-g sterile needle with an outer diameter of 0.91 mm was inserted through the af into the np at a depth from the skin to the middle of the disc, which is controlled by a handmade stopper [42,43]. then, the needle was rotated 360 and held for 30 s. after 2 weeks, 80 male rats were divided into five groups: the control group (without needle puncture and other treatments); the degeneration group (with needle puncture and dmem injection); the ccs group (with needle puncture and 0.02% genipin cross-linked ccs injection); the adsc group (with needle puncture and adsc injection); and the ccsa group (with needle puncture and ccsa delivery system injection). injection of the ccs and ccsa was delayed for approximately 5 min to decrease the diffusion of hydrogel. the injection volume for each group was 2 ml, and a microsyringe attached to a 31-g needle was used to deliver the materials to the np [44]. 2.11. cell tracking to allow cell tracking, the adscs were labeled with a fluorescent intracellular carboxyfluorescein n-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (cfse) cell labeling kit (abcam) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injection, specimens were harvested and cross-sectioned (5 lm) with a freezing microtome (cm1860; leica, wetzlar, germany). then, the specimens were stained with dapi (sigma aldrich) for 3 min and observed under a fluorescence microscope (dm5500, leica). 2.12. disc height measurement a molybdenum target radiographic image unit (ge mammography dmr bucky 18  24, ge healthcare, uk) was used to detect the disc height of rats at 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after injection. the rats fig. 1.

hence, we chose the rat tail discs to perform injections [52,53]. although genipin is regarded as a less toxic cross-linker for cells, high concentration is inadvisable when mixed directly together with cells. the cross-linking degree of 0.02% genipin was nearly 37%, and the type ii collagen and cs remnants after 24 days of biodegradation were nearly 26% and 40%, respectively. higher concentrations of genipin can increase the cross-linking degree and biostability of the scaffold [54], but they increase cytotoxicity and change surface characteristics of the scaffold as well. the function of adscs is more important in stem cell-based tissue engineering; hence, we consider a concentration of 0.02% (the corresponding concentration of etoh is 0.075%, which is also safe to adscs; supplemental fig. 1) to be optimal for the cross-linking of the ccsa delivery system. cell shape and matrix stiffness influence the differentiation of stem cells [55–57]. a spherical morphology associated with a dispersed actin cytoskeleton with few focal adhesions stimulates the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs), in addition to the osteogenic differentiation [58]. moreover, several studies have also reported that substrates with low stiffness are more favorable for np-like differentiation [22,59]. our in vitro study has demonstrated the ccs can induce the loaded adscs to differentiate into an np-like phenotype and increase ecm synthesis. we consider that the stimulation effect of ccs is associated with the low stiffness exhibited by ccs and the spherical shape of adscs. the np-like phenotype and chondrogenic phenotype are difficult to distinguish, as both np cells and chondrocytes express high levels of sox9, acan, col2, and their corresponding proteins [47,60,61]. krt19 and pax1 are characteristic genes in np cells, which have the potential to characterize human np cells [46,62]. gdf10 is a novel chondrocyte marker that is expressed more than 100-fold in chondrocytes than in np cells [46]. with the help of these specific gene markers, we clarified the differentiation status of adscs. the results of cfse-positive adscs delivered by ccs, which remained in clusters 1 week after injection, demonstrated that the scaffold turned into gel in situ and restrained the migration of adscs. over time, the biodegradation of ccs was enhanced, and adscs migrated to other locations of the np. the fluorescence intensity and number of cfse-positive adscs injected with ccs decreased significantly at the 4th week after injection, but it did not mean that the adscs had disappeared. cfse-positive adscs had the intracellular fluorescent label that was incorporated in a stable form but decreased over time as a function of dilution with cell division. the ccsa group showed significant regeneration after 16 weeks, which means the adscs were functional; we considered that cell division was the reason for the decreased fluorescence intensity and the decreased number of cfse-positive adscs we observed at week 4. our in vivo study results showed some characteristics of the degenerated disc, such as a decrease in disc height; a decrease in ecm, water content, and np cells in the np; and the abnormal structure of the np. ccs alone could increase disc height and np water content in a short time. we think this finding is due to the ccs being a hydrogel, which has a high proportion of water. moreover, the ccs in the np exhibited a g0 relatively higher than g00 , indicating the ccs presented in a more solid-like form and could buffer the pressure on the disc [38]. however, the ccs did not regenerate the degenerated np essentially; hence, the disc height and np water content of the ccs group showed no significant difference in the degeneration group after a long-term treatment owing to the biodegradation of ccs. degenerated np had a suboptimal environment (low oxygen tension, limited nutrition, acidic ph, and high osmolarity), which showed a negatively influence on the function or even survival of the transplanted cells [63– 65]. adscs injected without the scaffold showed no obvious regenerative effect in the np because adscs experienced the difficulty in surviving and synthesizing matrix in a harsh environment [66]. our ccs provides adherent sites for adscs and is likely to stimulate the differentiation of adscs into an np-like phenotype; hence, the cells we injected survived, synthesized the matrix, and regenerated the degenerated np. the histological score is based on five categories of degenerative changes and range from 5 points for a normal disc to 15 points for a severely degenerated disc. the ccsa group showed a decrease in histological score after 16 weeks, x. zhou et al. / acta biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 507 which means that the degenerated np was repaired to some extent, displaying increased disc height, water content, proteoglycan and type ii collagen synthesis, and recovery of np structure. however, there is still a gap between the normal and regenerated np, as the histological score of the ccsa group was still higher than that of the control group. we used needle puncture to inject our ccsa delivery system through the af into the np in this study. several studies have reported that the needle puncture in healthy ivds could lead to a loss of tissue functionality and disc pressure [67]. however, the degenerated disc, on its own, causes matrix degradation and reduced disc height [68,69]. the processes of delivering ccsa system through injection is unlikely to aggravate the matrix loss but will provide biological benefits to the degenerated np. the limitations of our ccsa delivery system in clinical application are the low collagen content (3 mg/ml) in the hydrogel and low mechanical property. studies have demonstrated that np acts as a cushion with shock-absorbing properties [70,71]. the modulus of the healthy np is approximately 11 kpa [72], which is significantly higher than that in our ccsa group. while stimulating np-like differentiation of adscs, the low collagen density of our ccsa delivery system loses mechanical support and it is difficult to stabilize a degenerated disc. more research should be carried out to improve the inducing efficiency of np-like differentiation and the mechanical property of our ccsa delivery system together. 5. conclusion in this study, we fabricated a novel scaffold with type ii collagen and cs to deliver adscs through needle injection. the ccs we fabricated is cross-linked with 0.02% genipin and has the ability of in situ gelation after injection. although the cross-linking degree is low, the ccs showed an increased bio-stability and solid-like properties after gelation. our in vitro results demonstrated the bio-safety of the ccs on adscs and the stimulation effects of the scaffold on the differentiation of adscs. we further studied the regenerative effects of the ccsa delivery system on the degenerated np in an animal model, and we demonstrated that the ccsa delivery system could partly regenerate the degenerated np. we hope our study can provide new insights into the clinical application of stem cell-based tissue engineering for the treatment of ivd degeneration. acknowledgments this study was partly supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china (81401822, 81472114, 81401011, and 81572177), the general science and technology planning project (2016c33151), zhejiang provincial natural science foundation of china (q14h060007 and y13h060001), and the general research program of zhejiang provincial department of health (2016142263 and 2016146428). declaration of interest the authors report no declaration of interest. appendix a. supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.03.019. references [1] g.b. andersson, epidemiological features of chronic low-back pain, lancet 354 (9178) (1999) 581–585.

nucleus pulposus (np) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent lower back pain. although adipose-derived stem cell (adsc)-based therapy is regarded to be promising for the treatment of degenerated np, there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant adscs into the np while maintaining cell function. in this study, we developed a type ii collagen/chondroitin sulfate (cs) composite hydrogel-like adsc (ccsa) delivery system with genipin as the crosslinking agent. the induction effect of the scaffold on adsc differentiation was studied in vitro, and a rat coccygeal vertebrae degeneration model was used to investigate the regenerative effect of the ccsa system on the degenerated np in vivo. the results showed that the ccsa delivery system crosslinked with 0.02% genipin was biocompatible and promoted the expressions of np-specific genes. after the injection of the ccsa system, the disc height, water content, extracellular matrix synthesis, and structure of the degenerated np were partly restored. our ccsa delivery system uses minimally invasive approaches to promote the regeneration of degenerated np and provides an exciting new avenue for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. statement of significance nucleus pulposus (np) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent lower back pain. stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method in np regeneration, but there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant adscs into the np while maintaining cell function. in this study, we developed a type ii collagen/chondroitin sulfate (cs) composite hydrogel-like adsc (ccsa) delivery system with genipin as the cross-linking agent. although several research groups have studied the fabrication of injectable hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works. we chose type ii collagen and cs, the two primary native components in the np, as the main materials and combined them according to the natural ratio of collagen and sgag in the np. the delivery system is preloaded with adscs and can be injected into the np with a needle, followed by in situ gelation. genipin is used as a cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low cytotoxicity. we investigated the stimulatory effects of our scaffold on the differentiation of adscs in vitro and the regenerative effect of the ccsa delivery system on degenerated np in vivo.  2018 acta materialia inc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. 1. introduction intervertebral disc (ivd) degeneration and consequent lower back pain affect approximately 80% of people at some point in their lives [1]. the ivd consists of three major components: the inner nucleus pulposus (np), the outer annulus fibrosus, and cartilage https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.03.019 1742-7061/ 2018 acta materialia inc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. ⇑ corresponding author. e-mail address: zrcqx@zju.edu.cn (q. chen). 1 these authors contributed equally to this work. acta biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 contents lists available at sciencedirect acta biomaterialia journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/actabiomat endplates [2]. the np is a highly hydrophilic substance, which contributes to the flexibility of the spinal column and load-bearing capacity of the ivd [3]. the degeneration of np caused by extracellular matrix (ecm) loss is thought to be the cause of ivd degeneration [4]. stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method for np regeneration. bio-scaffolds are essential to transplant stem cells into specific locations and create an appropriate microenvironment [5]. scaffolds fabricated by synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid [6], polycaprolactone [7], and polyethylene glycol [8] have good mechanical properties, but have poor cell adhesion without surface modification. additionally, the ivd is an avascular tissue and exchange of substances in this area is difficult [9]; thus, the synthetic polymers and their degradation products are not easy to remove. the accumulation of foreign substances may aggravate the suboptimal microenvironment in the ivd and reduce the ph and oxygen concentration, thereby inhibiting cell survival [10]. the principle of a bio-scaffold is to emulate the biological environment of the local tissue [11], and from this point of view, the acellular np scaffolds seem to be a good choice. however, decellularization can cause matrix loss and denaturation [12]. additionally, allogeneic np tissues are difficult to obtain. these disadvantages limit the use of acellular np scaffolds. the np contains an amorphous matrix of highly hydrated proteoglycans embedded in a loose network of collagen [13]. proteoglycans consist of a protein core modified by sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sgag). chondroitin sulfate (cs) is the most important sgag in the np and enables the np to withstand substantial compressive loads by attracting water [14,15]. the most abundant collagen type in the np is type ii collagen [16], which gives the disc its form and tensile strength [13]. several studies have demonstrated that the ratio of sgag to hydroxyproline in the normal np is approximately 27:1 [17], and the hydroxyproline content is equivalent to 10% of the weight of collagen [18]. using type ii collagen and cs, we can fabricate a scaffold with better biological properties. injectable scaffolds can mostly avoid the degeneration of the ivd structure during the transplant; hence, hydrogel scaffolds composed of type ii collagen and cs are adequate. an ideal hydrogel would have low viscosity during injection followed by in situ gelation, deliver cells, fill micro and macro fissures, and restore disc height [19]. cross-linking is the most common approach to stabilize the biomaterials [20,21]. in addition, the gelation velocity of many hydrogel scaffolds is regulated by cross-linking. the most widely used cross-linking treatments can be mainly divided into two types: chemical and physical. physical cross-linking methods such as photo-cross-linking can result in toxicity to the cells being delivered [22]. chemical cross-linking is applicable in fixing ecmderived scaffolds and the agents are mainly classified as chemical and natural agents. glutaraldehyde and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (edc) are representative chemical agents, and they effectively increase the mechanical stability of bio-scaffolds. however, the toxicity and induced calcification of these agents limit long-term implantation [23,24]. genipin is obtained from the natural compound geniposide, which is extracted from the fruit of the gardenia jasminoides ellis plant [25]. genipin has low toxicity and is regarded as a natural crosslinking agent; the cross-linking processes are controllable and subtle and products are stable [25,26]. type ii collagen/cs composite scaffolds have already been reported in previous studies [27,28]. however, these studies focused on fabricating three-dimensional porous scaffolds and the usage of toxic chemical cross-linking agents limits the construction of the cell delivery system. genipin at proper concentrations provides the possibility of fabricating a cell-mixed type ii collagen/cs composite hydrogel, which has no cytotoxicity towards the delivered cells. adipose-derived stem cell (adsc) is a kind of stem cell that is derived from the adipose tissues. adscs have the ability to differentiate into different kinds of cells in specific environments; hence, they are widely used in stem cell-based tissue engineering [29,30]. our previous study has demonstrated that adscs can be guided to differentiate into an np-like phenotype with the stimulation of type ii collagen [31]. similar conclusions have also been reported by other researchers [32]. thus, adscs are suitable seeding cells in our type ii collagen/cs composite hydrogel-like cell delivery system. in the current study, we chose type ii collagen and cs, the main components of a healthy np, and combined them at a specific ratio according to ecm composition of the np. a suitable concentration of genipin was used to cross-link the adsc mixed type ii collagen/ cs hydrogel. we aimed to fabricate an np-like injectable cell delivery system based on type ii collagen and cs, investigating its biological effects on adscs in vitro and verifying its regenerative effects on degenerated ivds. we hope our study will provide new insights into stem cell-based tissue engineering and the construction of a ecm-based injectable cell delivery system. 2. materials and methods 2.1. cell culture sprague–dawley (sd) rat adscs bought from cyagen biosciences (rasmd-01001; guangzhou, china) were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution under static conditions in a humidified incubator at 37 c with 5% co2. the culture medium was completely replaced every 3 days, and cells from passages 4–6 were then harvested for subsequent experiments. 2.2. scaffold preparation the type ii collagen/cs composite hydrogel-like adsc (ccsa) delivery system was prepared by the following steps: first, 6 mg/ ml type ii collagen (chicken sternal cartilage; sigma aldrich, usa) and 20 mg/ml cs (sigma aldrich) were mixed on ice, and 0.1 m naoh, 10x pbs, and dmem were used to adjust the ph to approximately 7.2. then, a suspension of adscs in dmem was added into the mixed solution to a final concentration of 3 mg/ ml type ii collagen, 8.1 mg/ml cs, 1x pbs, and 2 * 106/ml adscs [33]. the blank type ii collagen/cs composited hydrogel (ccs) was prepared by the same method except without adscs. various concentrations of genipin (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 1% w/v; aladdin, china) dissolved in 75% etoh were added into the gel forming solution for subsequent cross-linking. 2.3. cytotoxicity assay the cytotoxicity of genipin cross-linked scaffolds was determined after 3, 7, and 14 days of cultivation. the supernatant of each group was collected and tested for lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) content. the ldh assay kit (jiancheng bioengineering institute, china), by following the manufacturer’s protocol, was used to determine the ldh content. absorbance values were detected at 440 nm to reflect the ldh content. 2.4. cell proliferation the cck-8 assay kit (dojindo molecular technologies, japan) was used to detect cell proliferation. adscs were cultured for 3, 7, and 14 days before determination. at each time point, the complete med- x. zhou et al. / acta biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 497 ium was replaced with 200 ml of prepackaged cck-8 solution (180 ml of dmem and 20 ml of cck-8). each group was incubated at 37 c under 5% co2 for 4 h, and then 150 ml of the supernatant was collected and measured by reading the absorbance values at 450 nm using a model 680 microplate reader (bio-rad, usa). 2.5. gene and protein expression analyses the ccsa delivery systems were allowed to form gels in 12-well plates, and equal amount of adscs cultured as a monolayer were served as the control. all the groups were cultured in np cells inductive differentiation medium (dmem supplemented with 5 mg/ml of transferrin, 5 mg/ml of selenous acid, 0.1 mm dexamethasone, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mm proline, 1.25 mg/ml bsa, 5 mg/ml insulin, 0.17 mm ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 10 ng/ ml tgf-b3, and 10 ng/ml igf-1) [34]. the expression levels of target genes (table 1) were determined after 7 and 14 days of treatment. total rna was extracted using the rnaiso reagent (takara bio, japan), followed by reverse transcription utilizing the prime- scripttm rt reagent kit (takara bio). mrna was analyzed using the steponeplus real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, ca, usa) and sybr green (takara bio). the housekeeping gene was 18s rrna, and all of the primers were synthesized by sangon biotech (shanghai, china). the results were calculated using the 2ddct method. protein analysis was carried out after 21 days of treatment. the total protein in each group was extracted in ripa buffer containing 1% pmsf, and the concentration was measured by the bca method. proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (millipore, ma, usa). the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (tbst) at room temperature for 1 h and were hybridized overnight at 4 c in tbst with the appropriate primary antibody: sox9 (1:1000, abcam, uk), acan (1:1000, abcam), col1 (1:1000; abcam), col2 (1:5000; abcam), or gapdh (1:5000; santa cruz, usa). then, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000; santa cruz) for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. the relative protein levels were quantified by densitometry using quantity one software (bio-rad laboratories inc., munich, germany). 2.6. microstructure before microstructure observation with scanning electron microscopy (sem; su8010, hitachi, japan), samples were frozen at 80 c and lyophilized for 24 h. then, all samples were mounted onto aluminum stubs with carbon tape and sputter coated with a thin gold film (emitech, k550) to avoid electrical charging. 2.7. in vitro biodegradation the stability of scaffolds was determined by measuring the biodegradation in vitro using bacterial collagenase and chondroitinase abc at a concentration of 10 and 0.4 u/ml without the disturbance of cells [35]. two hundred microliters of ccs with or without cross-linking by 0.02% genipin were immersed in 1 ml of enzymatic digestion solution for up to 24 days. the complete medium after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 days of incubation was collected for the next measurement. the hydroxyproline content was detected to reflect the type ii collagen biodegradation using the hydroxyproline assay kit (jiancheng bioengineering institute, china). the cs biodegradation was detected by the 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (dmmb) assay [36], and the standard curve was prepared with

of ninhydrin and 30 mg of hydrindantin dissolved in 20 ml of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether) was added to the samples and incubated in a boiling water bath for 15 min. the reacted ninhydrin solution was then cooled to room temperature and diluted in 60% ethanol. the optical absorbance of the solutions at 570 nm was recorded using a model 680 microplate reader (bio-rad). the cross-linking degree

total of 800 ml of sample was loaded onto the stage and the upper plate was lowered up to a 1 mm gap. strain amplitude sweep mode was chosen, and a sweep strain from 0.01% to 100% at constant frequency (1 hz) was performed. the storage modulus (g0) and loss modulus (g00), which represent the energy stored and dissipated, respectively [38,39], during the shear process were recorded. the temperature of tests was controlled at 37 c. to determine the gelation time of the ccsa delivery system, 800 ml of sample was loaded on the stage with 1% strain at constant frequency (1 hz) at 37c. the change in g0 and g00 was recorded every 30 s for a duration of 30 min. the gelation time was determined at the time point when the g0 curve intersected the g00 curve [40]. 2.10. animal and surgical procedures sd rats weighting 150 g were used for the in vivo experiments. all the animals were obtained from the animal center of the academy of medical science of zhejiang province, and all procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of zhejiang university. the surgical procedures had already been reported in our previous study [41]. anesthesia was administered by intraperitoneal injection with 1% pentobarbital sodium. the coccygeal vertebrae (co)7/co8 and co8/co9 were located by digital palpation and confirmed by a trial radiograph. a 20-g sterile needle with an outer diameter of 0.91 mm was inserted through the af into the np at a depth from the skin to the middle of the disc, which is controlled by a handmade stopper [42,43]. then, the needle was rotated 360 and held for 30 s. after 2 weeks, 80 male rats were divided into five groups: the control group (without needle puncture and other treatments); the degeneration group (with needle puncture and dmem injection); the ccs group (with needle puncture and 0.02% genipin cross-linked ccs injection); the adsc group (with needle puncture and adsc injection); and the ccsa group (with needle puncture and ccsa delivery system injection). injection of the ccs and ccsa was delayed for approximately 5 min to decrease the diffusion of hydrogel. the injection volume for each group was 2 ml, and a microsyringe attached to a 31-g needle was used to deliver the materials to the np [44]. 2.11. cell tracking to allow cell tracking, the adscs were labeled with a fluorescent

hence, we chose the rat tail discs to perform injections [52,53]. although genipin is regarded as a less toxic cross-linker for cells, high concentration is inadvisable when mixed directly together with cells. the cross-linking degree of 0.02% genipin was nearly 37%, and the type ii collagen and cs remnants after 24 days of biodegradation were nearly 26% and 40%, respectively. higher concentrations of genipin can increase the cross-linking degree and biostability of the scaffold [54], but they increase cytotoxicity and change surface characteristics of the scaffold as well. the function of adscs is more important in stem cell-based tissue engineering; hence, we consider a concentration of 0.02% (the corresponding concentration of etoh is 0.075%, which is also safe to adscs; supplemental fig. 1) to be optimal for the cross-linking of the ccsa delivery system. cell shape and matrix stiffness influence the differentiation of stem cells [55–57]. a spherical morphology associated with a dispersed actin cytoskeleton with few focal adhesions stimulates the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs), in addition to the osteogenic differentiation [58]. moreover, several studies have also reported that substrates with low stiffness are more favorable for np-like differentiation [22,59]. our in vitro study has demonstrated the ccs can induce the loaded adscs to differentiate into an np-like phenotype and increase ecm synthesis. we consider that the stimulation effect of ccs is associated with the low stiffness exhibited by ccs and the spherical shape of adscs. the np-like phenotype and chondrogenic phenotype are difficult to distinguish, as both np cells and chondrocytes express high levels of sox9, acan, col2, and their corresponding proteins [47,60,61]. krt19 and pax1 are characteristic genes in np cells, which have the potential to characterize human np cells [46,62]. gdf10 is a novel chondrocyte marker that is expressed more than 100-fold in chondrocytes than in np cells [46]. with the help of these specific gene markers, we clarified the differentiation status of adscs. the results of cfse-positive adscs delivered by ccs, which remained in clusters 1 week after injection, demonstrated that the scaffold turned into gel in situ and restrained the migration of adscs. over time, the biodegradation of ccs was enhanced, and adscs migrated to other locations of the np. the fluorescence intensity and number of cfse-positive adscs injected with ccs decreased significantly at the 4th week after injection, but it did not mean that the adscs had disappeared. cfse-positive adscs had the intracellular fluorescent label that was incorporated in a stable form but decreased over time as a function of dilution with cell division. the ccsa group showed significant regeneration after 16 weeks, which means the adscs were functional; we considered that cell division was the reason for the decreased fluorescence intensity and the decreased number of cfse-positive adscs we observed at week 4. our in vivo study results showed some characteristics of the degenerated disc, such as a decrease in disc height; a decrease in ecm, water content, and np cells in the np; and the abnormal structure of the np. ccs alone could increase disc height and np water content in a short time. we think this finding is due to the ccs being a hydrogel, which has a high proportion of water. moreover, the ccs in the np exhibited a g0 relatively higher than g00 , indicating the ccs presented in a more solid-like form and could buffer the pressure on the disc [38]. however, the ccs did not regenerate the degenerated np essentially; hence, the disc height and np water content of the ccs group showed no significant difference in the degeneration group after a long-term treatment owing to the biodegradation of ccs. degenerated np had a suboptimal environment (low oxygen tension, limited nutrition, acidic ph, and high osmolarity), which showed a negatively influence on the function or even survival of the transplanted cells [63– 65]. adscs injected without the scaffold showed no obvious regenerative effect in the np because adscs experienced the difficulty in surviving and synthesizing matrix in a harsh environment [66]. our ccs provides adherent sites for adscs and is likely to stimulate the differentiation of adscs into an np-like phenotype; hence, the cells we injected survived, synthesized the matrix, and regenerated the degenerated np. the histological score is based on five categories of degenerative changes and range from 5 points for a normal disc to 15 points for a severely degenerated disc. the ccsa group showed a decrease in histological score after 16 weeks, x. zhou et al. / acta biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 507 which means that the degenerated np was repaired to some extent, displaying increased disc height, water content, proteoglycan and type ii collagen synthesis, and recovery of np structure. however, there is still a gap between the normal and regenerated np, as the histological score of the ccsa group was still higher than that of the control group. we used needle puncture to inject our ccsa delivery system through the af into the np in this study. several studies have reported that the needle puncture in healthy ivds could lead to a loss of tissue functionality and disc pressure [67]. however, the degenerated disc, on its own, causes matrix degradation and reduced disc height [68,69]. the processes of delivering ccsa system through injection is unlikely to aggravate the matrix loss but will provide biological benefits to the degenerated np. the limitations of our ccsa delivery system in clinical application are the low collagen content (3 mg/ml) in the hydrogel and low mechanical property. studies have demonstrated that np acts as a cushion with shock-absorbing properties [70,71]. the modulus of the healthy np is approximately 11 kpa [72], which is significantly higher than that in our ccsa group. while stimulating np-like differentiation of adscs, the low collagen density of our ccsa delivery system loses mechanical support and it is difficult to stabilize a degenerated disc. more research should be carried out to improve the inducing efficiency of np-like differentiation and the mechanical property of our ccsa delivery system together. 5. conclusion in this study, we fabricated a novel scaffold with type ii collagen and cs to deliver adscs through needle injection. the ccs we fabricated is cross-linked with 0.02% genipin and has the ability of in situ gelation after injection. although the cross-linking degree is low, the ccs showed an increased bio-stability and solid-like properties after gelation. our in vitro results demonstrated the bio-safety of the ccs on adscs and the stimulation effects of the scaffold on the differentiation of adscs. we further studied the regenerative effects of the ccsa delivery system on the degenerated np in an animal model, and we demonstrated that the ccsa delivery system could partly regenerate the degenerated np. we hope our study can provide new insights into the clinical application of stem cell-based tissue engineering for the treatment of ivd degeneration. acknowledgments this study was partly supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china (81401822, 81472114, 81401011, and 81572177), the general science and technology planning project (2016c33151), zhejiang provincial natural science foundation of china (q14h060007 and y13h060001), and the general research program of zhejiang provincial department of health (2016142263 and 2016146428). declaration of interest the authors report no declaration of interest. appendix a. supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.03.019. references [1] g.b. andersson, epidemiological features of chronic low-back pain, lancet 354 (9178) (1999) 581–585.
