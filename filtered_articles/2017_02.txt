shaheen et al., 2014). however, it remains unclear how this mode of shared transportation interacts with pre-existing public transit systems. in particular, the overall impact on transit ridership has yet to be quantified. for this study we focus specifically on the impact that opening a bikesharing system had on daily bus ridership in new york city. there are a number of possible ways that bikesharing could impact bus ridership. as a direct effect, a bikesharing system may be a substitute or a complement to the pre-existing bus network. for example, a person could use bikesharing in lieu of a trip they would have taken by bus. this kind of substitution would result in a loss of bus ridership at a rate of one-to-one. alternatively, a person could use bikesharing in addition to public transit, which is commonly referred to as solving the firstand last- mile problem (shaheen et al., 2010). this complementary situation could lead to an increase in bus ridership. as a http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2017.04.017 0965-8564/ 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. ⇑ corresponding author. e-mail addresses: krc2104@columbia.edu (k.b. campbell), cbrakewood@ccny.cuny.edu (c. brakewood). transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 contents lists available at sciencedirect transportation research part a journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/tra third option, bikesharing may generate new trips, such as for recreational use, which would not impact bus ridership. for different users or at different times, bikesharing and buses could be interrelated in any of these three ways. an important, but often overlooked, aspect is the indirect effect that a bikesharing system may have on the travel behavior of non-members. there are numerous possible indirect effects. for example, if bikeshare users substitute away from buses, a reduction in bus passengers and crowding could encourage a new group of travelers to begin riding the bus, which could minimize the overall impact on bus ridership. in another scenario, opening a bikesharing system could encourage people to ride private bicycles more, particularly if they now perceive the city to be more bike-friendly. if these trips would otherwise have been made by bus, then there could be a reduction in bus ridership at a rate greater than one-to-one. the ways that bikesharing could impact how non-members travel remains largely unexplored, and it is currently unknown what this net effect of bikesharing is on bus ridership. in this study, we measure the impact that opening a bikesharing system had on the bus network in new york city (nyc) using daily route-level bus ridership data. because the bikesharing system, citi bike, had a phased implementation, we treat it like a natural experiment. we divide bus routes into control and treatment groups based on if they were in the areas that received bikesharing stations or not. a difference-in-differences regression model allows us to isolate the effects of the introduction of bikesharing from other area, group, and time effects and establish a causal link between bikesharing and bus ridership. estimates from our preferred model indicate that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42% reduction in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn. in a second model that also controls for bike lane infrastructure, we find a 1.69% reduction in bus trips. these results are statistically significant and hold under a variety of specifications. the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section 2 provides an overview of previous research and gaps in the existing literature. section 3 provides background to understand the natural experiment and identification strategy. section 4 describes the data we use, and section 5 describes how we construct the control and treatment groups and the regression methodology. in section 6, we present the results. section 7 describes limitations and future research areas. we discuss the implications of the findings and conclude in section 8. 2. prior research in a literature review on bikesharing, fishman et al. (2013) identify two themes that pertain to the relationship between bikeshare and public transit: modal integration and modal substitution. modal integration focuses on the location of bikeshare infrastructure near transit stations so that passengers can use bikeshare in conjunction with transit. modal substitution refers to trips made by bikeshare that were previously made by transit. in another recent literature review, ricci (2015) notes that more attention has been paid to understanding how much bikesharing shifts people away from the automobile and that the results regarding public transit are mixed. we have found that there are a limited number of studies that pertain to these two transit-related themes; the most relevant ones are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. in terms of modal integration, bikeshare operators typically locate stations close to transit stops to facilitate transfers between the two modes. numerous studies have found that variables relating to public transit can be a significant predictor of bikeshare usage (fishman et al., 2014; hampshire and marla, 2012; nair et al., 2013; rixey, 2013; sato et al., 2015). in new york city, bikesharing stations that are located near subway stations, particularly stations with a high number of average monthly subway boardings, saw higher bikeshare usage (noland et al., 2016). these findings suggest that there could be a complementary relationship between bikesharing and transit, although for new york city, this relationship has only been explored for the subway and remains unknown for the bus system. regarding modal substitution, bikeshare member surveys typically find that many people reduce their bus use as a result of bikesharing, although the size of the effect varies across cities and even within a city (buck et al., 2013; fuller et al., 2013; murphy and usher, 2015; shaheen et al., 2011; shaheen et al., 2013; tang et al., 2011). in a survey of montreal, washington d.c., toronto, and the twin cities, 17% to 47% of respondents reported that they decreased their bus usage as a result of bikesharing, although within these same cities 2% to 14% reported increasing their bus usage. even though they found an overall substitutionary effect, there were members using bikeshare as a complement to buses as well (shaheen et al., 2013). in subsequent research, martin and shaheen (2014) found that bikeshare members in washington d.c. living in the urban core were more likely to report decreases in bus use as a result of bikesharing, while respondents living in the urban periphery were more likely to report increases. however, this relationship did not hold in minneapolis, where respondents reported increasing and decreasing usage in almost equal proportion whether they lived in the urban core or periphery. the authors posit that bikesharing is more likely to act as a complement in cities with lower population density and less dense transit networks. similarly, another survey in montreal found that the majority of bikeshare users shifted away from public transit. they also asked non-users about their travel behavior and found that 3% of respondents who do not use bikeshare reported shifting to public transit as a result of bikesharing (fuller et al., 2013). they confirmed their hypothesis that, as a large-scale change in the built environment, bikesharing could have impacts on active travel beyond the direct effect on bikeshare members. while there are no publicly available surveys of bikeshare members in new york city, survey results from other cities begin to quantify the proportion of bikeshare users who may have a direct impact on transit ridership by changing their travel behavior; however, these studies do not quantify the magnitude of that impact in terms of total transit trips gained or lost. in addition, the surveys of only bikeshare members are unable to capture indirect effects on transit from changes to the k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 265 travel behavior of non-members, although there is some evidence that demonstrates that bikesharing systems can have broader indirect effects. there are two noteworthy prior studies that examine the magnitude of the impact of bikeshare on transit ridership. the first examined the impact of bikesharing on rail ridership in washington d.c., which had the second largest bikesharing system in the united states at the time. using regression analysis, the authors found that a 10% increase in bikeshare trips is associated with a 2.8% increase in metrorail ridership (ma et al., 2015). although they find a significant relationship, the cross-sectional study design makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of bikesharing from other trends in rail ridership, and it is possible that other trends in rail ridership could have driven the effect. the second noteworthy study, which is perhaps the most relevant reference for this research, is a study on the impacts of real-time transit information on bus ridership in new york city (brakewood et al., 2015). the study analyzed route-level weekday average bus ridership per month over a three year period from 2011 to 2013 using panel regression. the availability of bikesharing was modeled as a binary control variable for all bus routes in manhattan and brooklyn after the bikesharing program commenced, and the authors found that it had a significant, negative effect on route-level bus ridership (over 500 daily bus trips per route in manhattan and approximately 375 daily bus trips per route in brooklyn). however, the authors note that the magnitude of the coefficient appeared to be unrealistically large. performing a back of the envelope calculation, the reduction in bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn would be equivalent to very large percentage (almost all) of bikesharing systems average weekday ridership in 2013. therefore, the authors recommended further study to better understand the complex relationship between bus ridership and bikesharing. by quantifying the impact that bikesharing has on bus ridership, we contribute to the literature in the following ways. first, our research design is better suited for quantifying a causal relationship than geospatial and cross-sectional studies. second, we study the impact to buses, which has been largely overlooked in prior studies that have focused on rail systems. third, we capture aggregate level impacts to the transit network. although surveys provide a good assessment of the causal way bikeshare users alter their travel behavior, they typically do not capture indirect effects of the behavioral change of nonmembers, and they require a number of assumptions to estimate the net impacts to transit ridership. furthermore, we account for the varying intensity of bikesharing infrastructure, an improvement over studies using a dummy variable to capture the effect. finally, this relationship has not been well studied in new york city, which has the largest public transit system and largest bikesharing system in the united states at the time of this writing. 3. background in the following paragraphs, we provide background information about the bus and bikesharing systems in new york city. then we compare the two systems based on their prices, ridership trends, and trip characteristics. last, we describe specific transportation changes that were happening in new york city at this time. 3.1. bus service in new york city new york city is composed of five boroughs: manhattan, brooklyn, the bronx, queens, and staten island. most local bus service is operated by new york city transit (nyct) under the umbrella organization of the metropolitan transportation authority (mta). nyct operates the largest bus system in the country, which, in 2013, accounted for almost 15% of unlinked passenger bus trips nationwide and over 85% of trips in new york city (american public transportation association, 2015).1 the nyct bus system includes approximately 200 fixed routes. this study focuses on 85 bus routes located in the boroughs of manhattan (34 routes) and brooklyn (51 routes). 3.2. bikeshare in new york city new york city’s bikesharing network is the densest in the united states with 19.7 bikesharing stations per square mile compared to 6.8 in chicago and 4.4 in the district of columbia (gordon-koven and levenson, 2014). phase 1 of the bikesharing system opened on may 27, 2013 with a dense network of stations in southern manhattan and downtown brooklyn, while the rest of the city received no bikesharing infrastructure. as explained in section 5, we use the uneven geographic coverage to split the city into control and treatment areas, and within the treatment area, we quantify the amount of bikesharing infrastructure available. each bikesharing station has a number of bike docks where a user can lock or unlock an individual bike. fig. 1 shows the location of stations and the amount of docks at each station, highlighting how the density of docks and stations varies. the number of docks per station varies from 3 to 62 with manhattan having a slightly higher mean number of docks per station than brooklyn. the total number of bikesharing stations in manhattan is also higher at 262 compared to 82 in brooklyn. the vast majority of bikeshare trips (over 90%) are taken by annual members (kaufman et al., 2015), who provide basic demographic information, including age and gender, at the time of registration. during our study period, the median age for 1 the remaining were trips on routes operated by the mta bus company. because the mta bus company operates primarily in queens, we do not include these routes in our study. 266 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 bikeshare trips taken by annual members was 35 years old and 77.7% of those trips were taken by men. in contrast, the median age for bus passengers in the new york city region is higher and a larger proportion are female (new york metropolitan transportation council and north jersey transportation planning authority, 2014; seltzer, 2014). 3.3. bus and bikeshare prices to ride the bus, passengers pay with cash or use a metrocard, which works on nyct and mta bus company buses and the subway. there are a variety of payment options and fees, including single-ride tickets, unlimited period passes, discounts for larger purchases, fees to obtain a new metrocard, reduced fare passes for disabled or elderly passengers, free fares for students, and a number of other payment options. on march 3, 2013 (approximately three months prior to the opening of the bikeshare system), the base bus fare rose from $2.25 to $2.50, the price of a 7-day unlimited metrocard rose from $29 to $30, and the cost of a 30-day unlimited metrocard rose from $104 to $112. to use a bikeshare bicycle, riders have three options to pay: a 24-hour pass costing $9.95, a 7-day pass costing $25, or an annual membership costing $95. this means that the oneweek cost is similar across the two systems at $25 and $30, but that the annual cost for unlimited trips is much higher on the bus ($95 for an annual bikeshare membership and up to $1,344 for twelve unlimited monthly bus passes). 3.4. bus and bikeshare ridership, speed, and trip distances both the bus and bikeshare systems in new york city exhibit strong daily and seasonal ridership trends. both systems have higher ridership on weekdays than weekends with peaks during the morning and afternoon commutes (new york fig. 1. location of bikesharing stations and number of docks. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 267 city department of transportation, 2016; schneider, 2016). bikeshare trips are high from mid-may to mid-october, while bus ridership is high in the fall and spring. during our study period from may 27, 2012 to july 26, 2014 (excluding a two-month adjustment period after bikesharing opened), daily bikeshare trips ranged from a minimum of 978 to a maximum of 45,667 with an average of 26,072 daily bikeshare trips. there were 951,176 average daily unlinked bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn during this time, which is an order of magnitude larger than daily bikeshare ridership. daily bus route-level ridership ranged from a minimum of 279 to a maximum of 48,785, with a mean of 11,231 daily unlinked trips per route. average daily bus ridership has been declining, such that citywide bus ridership fell 2% between 2014 and 2015, with ridership in manhattan falling by 6% in 2014, according to the new york city department of transportation (2016). we can see this slight decline in fig. 2, which show the average daily ridership per month during the study period for all bus routes in manhattan and brooklyn and for the bikeshare system. during our study period, average bikeshare speed was 8.4 mph and average trip distance was 1.7 miles. according to estimates from the new york city department of transportation (2016), average bus speed is frequently over 10 mph, particularly on arterial roads between neighborhoods, but is often 4 mph or less in central business districts like midtown manhattan. one example given by new york university’s rudin center estimates that ‘‘a mile-long bus trip across 34th street could take more than 20 minutes but a citi bike cuts the same trip down to 10 minutes or less, depending on the rider” (kaufman et al., 2015). the bikesharing and bus systems in new york city are comparable across a number of characteristics, although there are some instances where bikesharing may be more efficient. because of the similarity in travel speeds, we hypothesize that bikesharing may act as a substitute for bus trips in new york city. additionally, because daily bus ridership is magnitudes larger than daily bikeshare ridership, we do not expect to find a sizable impact on overall bus ridership. instead, quantifying the size of the effect can tell us more about the degree to which these systems interact with one another in new york city. 3.5. changes to the transportation network finally, there were other transportation changes happening during this time that are worth noting. first, bicycling was growing in new york city. in 2014, 25% of new yorkers reported that they rode a bike a least once in the past year. annual 0 50000 100000 average daily bikeshare trips 0 100000 200000

brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 cycling trips went from 98.6 million in 2011 to 153.3 million in 2014 (new york city department of transportation, 2017). during the same time period, new york city increased investment in bicycle infrastructure including bike lanes, bike signage, and signals, and in 2013 opened a bikeshare system. additionally, select bus service (sbs) was introduced on a small number of bus routes during the study period. sbs is a form of rapid bus service where passengers pay before boarding the bus, and buses have designated travel lanes and traffic signal priority in some areas. another change was the introduction of bus time, which provides passengers with real-time bus information via web-based and mobile interfaces; this was rolled out to some routes during the study period. a third change that happened to the broader transportation system during this time was the introduction of the boro taxi program, which allowed for-hire vehicles (besides yellow taxis) to pick up street hail passengers anywhere in the five boroughs except in the manhattan core (south of east 96th and west 110th st) (new york city taxi and limousine commission, 2013). a reduced fare metrocard program, referred to as access-a-ride, was also changed during the study period. furthermore, ridehailing services, such as uber and lyft, began operating in new york city in 2011 and grew in popularity during this time. these noteworthy transportation network changes are explained further in section 5. 4. data sources bus data were made available through a request to nyct. the data include daily unlinked bus trips per route, daily unlinked bus trips by route split by fare type used (full, reduced, or student fare), and scheduled revenue miles per route. from the scheduled revenue miles data and from mta press releases, we have information about when certain routes began operating select bus service, when they began offering bus time real-time information, and when the access-a-ride metro- card program was introduced. we use any route that primarily serves manhattan or brooklyn based on the bus route name, 2 but we exclude express routes and routes that pass into manhattan or brooklyn but primarily serve other boroughs. we combine a small number of bus routes that operate on sections of the same right-of-way and are scheduled together.3 additionally, we exclude dates when subway or bus service was canceled due to severe weather.4 we use publicly available data with the latitude and longitude of each bus stop along all nyct bus routes as of june 2015.5 the models presented in the following section were also tested using the latitude and longitude of each bus stop as of 2010, with no significant change in the results. we imported this data into arcgis using the display gtfs route shapes tool6 and used arcgis software by esri version 10.3.1 and the light gray canvas basemap to generate the maps presented here.7 citi bike data are publicly available.8 we downloaded daily total ridership and membership data for the period may 27, 2013 (the launch date) to december 31, 2014. additionally, we downloaded trip history data for the same period that includes the date and station location (latitude and longitude) where each bike trip begins. finally, we downloaded the citi bike station feed data that includes the number of docks at each bike station.9 a map of the boro taxi service area and launch date is publicly available from the new york city taxi and limousine commission (2013). miles of bike lanes and date built came from the new york city cycling map shapefile published annually by the new york city department of transportation.10 5. methodology this section describes the methodology, beginning with how we divide the bus routes into a control and treatment group based on variation in geographic coverage of the bikesharing network in section 5.1. next, we describe the difference-indifferences identification technique in section 5.2 and how it can be estimated using ordinary least squares regression in section 5.3.we present visual evidence that bus ridership is falling on routes in the treatment compared to the control when treatment is defined by geographic coverage of bikeshare. in sections 5.4–5.7, we explain variations to the main specification that address the robustness of the model including controlling for cycling infrastructure, controlling for a time trend in the treated group, changing the way we quantify treatment intensity, and performing a placebo analysis. finally, in section 5.8, we present a model using an alternative control and treatment group based on the type of bus fare payment used. this alternate model addresses some concerns about the endogeneity of the intervention itself and additional potential omitted variables. 2 in the naming convention for bus routes in new york city, the first letter of the bus route name typically refers to the borough in which the bus operates. 3 we combined the m102 and m103 with the m101, the m16 with the m34, and the b69 with the b67. 4 we exclude 8/27/2011–8/29/2011 (hurricane irene) and 10/28/2012–11/8/2012 (superstorm sandy). 5 bus stop location data were made available by the metropolitan transportation authority and downloaded from their developer data webpage: http://web. mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html. 6 the display gtfs routes shapes was created by melinda morang at esri and was downloaded from http://transit.melindamorang.com. 7 basemaps in all the images are the light gray canvas map by esri, delorme, here, and mapmyindia. 8 citi bike system data were made available by the operator of new york’s bikesharing service, nyc bike share, llc and motivate international, inc., and were downloaded from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. 9 to calculate the number of docks per station we used the average number of docks listed from daily live feed data averaged over the period from july 2013 through december 2014. in rare cases where data on the number of docks was missing, we assumed that these stations had the mean number of docks for the sample. 10 available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#bikes. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 269 5.1. definition of treatment based on intensity of geographic coverage of bikesharing one contribution of this research is quantifying the interrelationship between the bikesharing and bus systems based on the intensity of bikesharing infrastructure. as described in section 3 and shown in fig. 1, the number of stations and the number of docks at each station varies considerably.we develop a treatment measure based on the number of docks located near each bus route to capture the potential availability of a bikeshare bicycle. using data on bus route and bikesharing station locations, we count the number of bikesharing docks that fall within a 0.25 mile catchment area of the bus route. a quarter mile is commonly used by transit planners as the distance people will walk to reach a bus stop (walker, 2012). fig. 3 provides an illustration of how this measure is calculated along one example route, the m23 bus. in the figure, the bus route is shown in black, the catchment area is in orange, the bikesharing stations are light blue, and the bikesharing stations that fall within the catchment area are indicated by an orange outline. the circled number indicates how many docks are at each bikesharing station. we sum the number of docks over the entire route. in this example, there are a total of 1,172 docks along the m23 bus route. this treatment variable captures the fact that larger stations can have more bikes available, which better reflects the variation in intensity of bikeshare infrastructure. fig. 4 shows this treatment measure for all the bus routes in the sample. we test a few alternate treatment variables as described in section 5.6. 5.2. difference-in-differences research design the natural experiment afforded by the phased roll out of bikesharing allows us to use a difference-in-differences identification strategy. a difference-in-differences model uses panel data to compare the outcome in one group that receives treatment to a control group during the study period in an attempt to quantify the causal impact of a policy. the difference between the two groups before the policy went into effect is subtracted from the difference between the two groups after the policy went into effect. the difference of these two differences (hence the name) is the estimated effect of the policy. take for example, ridership (busridersjat) on bus route j in area a at time t. let bus routes in northern manhattan be the control group (a ¼ n), bus routes in southern manhattan be the treatment group (a ¼ s), one time period before the bikesharing system opened (t ¼ 0), and one time period after it opened (t ¼ 1). the average treatment effect is given by: ðe½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 1  e½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 0þ  ðe½busridersjat ja ¼ n; t ¼ 1  e½busridersjat ja ¼ n; t ¼ 0þ ¼ b ð1þ here, b is the causal effect of interest and, as described in the next section, it can be estimated using ordinary least squares regression. the major advantage of this identification strategy is that it removes biases caused by the permanent differences between the control and treatment groups, as well as biases caused by time trends impacting the entire sample. for example, if bus routes in the treated area consistently have higher ridership than routes in the control area, this will be washed out in the first difference (e½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 1  e½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 0) so that route size will not have a net effect on b. any characteristics of the control or treatment group that do not change over time are accounted for in this way. this is important because there are differences between population groups in terms of race, income, and education in areas that received bikesharing compared to nearby areas in new york city (ursaki and aultman-hall, 2016). similarly, this methodology controls for changes that happen over time and have the same impact to both groups. for example, if citywide population growth causes ridership to increase by a constant in the second period in both the control and treatment groups, taking the difference of the differences would result in a net effect of zero from the population increase. this example demonstrates the second feature of difference-in-differences, which is that time-varying factors that affect both groups can be accounted for by the second difference. 59 31 37 33 49 27 35 42

opened and impact the treatment group differently than the control group. whenever possible, we account for these types of potential omitted variables by adding control variables to the model. another concern is endogeneity of the intervention itself; in fig. 4. treatment variable based on the number of bikesharing docks along the bus route. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research

way of splitting the sample into control and treatment groups as a robustness check in section 5.8. 5.3. regression methodology using geographic coverage of bikesharing we can use ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effect of bikesharing on bus ridership based on the geographic coverage of bikesharing. we generalize the basic two-period and two-group difference-in-differences model discussed in the previous section to include multiple time periods and groups and to account for the intensity of bikesharing treatment. our preferred model takes the following form: lnbusridersjt ¼ a þ bbikeopent  bikeareaj  docksj þ ddatefet þ croutefej þ kcontrols0 jt þ ejt ð2þ here, lnbusridersjt is the natural log of ridership on day t on bus route j, and we use total daily unlinked bus trips per route on buses operated by nyct from may 27, 2012 to july 26, 2014, excluding a two-month bikeshare adjustment period from may 27, 2013 to july 26, 2013. we estimate the model for manhattan and brooklyn combined and for manhattan alone. we take the natural log of bus ridership because the pre-treatment average levels of daily bus ridership in the treatment group are much higher than in the control group. since the difference-in-differences effect is sensitive to functional form, we use the natural log of the differences to prevent changes in ridership on routes with larger total ridership from obscuring the effect. bikeopent is an indicator if the date is on or after may 27, 2013, which is when the bikesharing system opened. there are 354 days in the control period and 365 days in the treatment period (11 days in the control period were excluded due to severe service changes from superstorm sandy). bikeareaj is an indicator if any part of the bus route is near a bikesharing station. our variable of interest is bikeopent  bikeareaj  docksj, which is the interaction of bikeopent and bikeareaj weighted by docksj, a variable measuring the number of bike docks (in thousands) near the bus route. this variable identifies routes in the treatment area after the bikesharing system opened weighted by the intensity of bikeshare docking infrastructure. construction of this variable was explained in section 5.1 and alternate measures of treatment intensity are described in section 5.6. we include date fixed effects (datefet ), which control for daily system-wide variation, and route fixed effects (routefej), which control for characteristics of each route that do not vary over time. controls0 jt is a vector of area- and time- varying characteristics, described in the next paragraph. the residual error term is ejt . because of the potential for serial correlation across dates in this long time series, we use bootstrap standard errors (bertrand et al., 2004). we also cluster the standard errors at the bus route level (cameron and miller, 2015). estimations were completed in stata versions 12 and 14 and a number of packages were used.11 the vector controls0 jt includes variables for scheduled revenue miles of bus service, the introduction of select bus service, the roll out of real-time bus information, and the introduction of the boro taxi program. we include the natural log of total scheduled revenue miles, which captures the total miles that buses on a particular route are scheduled to travel that day while in revenue service. the level of bus service is an important predictor of bus ridership (evans et al., 2004). it takes into account differences in route length and frequency of service between routes and provides an indication of the level of service available each season.12 for select bus service, we include a dummy variable to indicate if any bus along a route was operating as sbs that day. regarding real-time bus information, we include a dummy variable to indicate if that bus route had bus time on that day. changes to the taxi service were modeled using a dummy variable for any route that has stops within the boro taxi service area for dates on or after august 8, 2013, which is when the first boro taxi ride occurred. an identifying assumption for our analysis is that, in the absence of treatment, the trend in the treatment group would follow the same trend as the control group. in fig. 5 we provide graphical evidence showing that prior to the bikesharing system opening, ridership in the control and treatment groups were following parallel trends. this figure shows the trend in average daily route-level bus ridership for each month with the study period of may 27, 2012 to may 26, 2013 (pre) and july 27, 2013 to july 26, 2014 (post) indicated by the gray boxes. the treatment group shown here includes bus routes in manhattan or brooklyn that have at least one bikesharing dock within 0.25 miles of the route, and the control group includes bus routes that are not near any bikesharing docks. we see in the graph and accompanying table that treatment routes have higher average ridership than control routes, that the groups are following a similar trend prior to bikeshare opening, and that there is a decrease in average bus trips in the treatment group compared to the control group after the bikesharing system opens (indicated by the vertical dashed line in the graph). 5.4. cycling infrastructure in a similar timeframe as the opening of the bikesharing system, new york city was investing in cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes and signals. cycling infrastructure has been shown to have a positive relationship with levels of private 11 packages used include carryforward (kantor, 2004), erepost (jann, 2005), estout (jann, 2007), and nearstat (jeanty, 2010). stata statistical software by statacorp (2015). 12 nyct sets scheduled revenue miles per route for each pick, which is similar to season and runs roughly from january-march, april-june, july-august, and september-december. 272 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 cycling (pucher and buehler, 2011), which could, in turn, also impact bus ridership. in the 12 months prior to opening the bikesharing system, 31 miles of bike lanes were installed with 18 miles located in the same area as the bikesharing system. in the 14 months after the bikesharing system opened, 55 more miles of bike lanes were installed including 7 miles in the bikesharing area. in our main specification, we do not separate this potential effect; however, in a second specification, we test how much of the result is being driven by cycling infrastructure and how much is being driven by bikesharing infrastructure by controlling for bike lanes. specifically we include a control variable for the miles of bike lanes that are within 0.25 miles of each bus route over the course of the study period using the date that the bike lane was installed. in terms of the differencein- differences identification strategy, bike lanes is a potential omitted variable because the amount of cycling infrastructure varied across the control and treatment areas during our study period. however, in our regression framework it is a confounding variable. because it is highly correlated with our variable of interest, including it as a control makes it difficult fig. 5. average daily bus ridership by month in manhattan and brooklyn on control and treatment routes based on geographic coverage. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 273 to untangle the impact that bike lanes had on bus ridership from the impact of the bikesharing system. therefore, we present this analysis to confirm that it is not driving our main result. 5.5. time trend we want to rule out the possibility that our results are being driven by some general downward trend in bus ridership on treated routes. to do so, we include a linear time trend interacted with the indicator for treated routes, bikeareaj , in some of our model specifications. both a linear and quadratic trend were fit, but because the results are similar only the linear time trend is presented. while this variable could account for any number of trends specific to the treatment group, we were particularly concerned that ridehailing services, such as uber, may be impacting bus ridership more in the treatment group. because we do not have the data to explicitly model ridehailing for the duration of our study period, we use this specification as another check of the main result. 5.6. other measures of treatment intensity in addition to our preferred treatment measure based the intensity of bikesharing dock infrastructure near bus routes, we develop three alternative treatment measures. the first alternative treatment measure is a dummy variable that is equal to one if the bus route is within a 0.25 mile radius of at least one bikesharing dock, and zero otherwise. the second alternative treatment measure is the total number of bikesharing stations within 0.25 miles of the bus route. this is similar to the treatment measure based on docks. our third alternative treatment measure is the number of bikesharing trips originating within 0.25 miles of the bus route each day. this last measure varies daily, while the rest of the measures are constant over time. fig. 6(a)–(c) shows each of these treatment measures for routes in the sample. the treatment measure based on the number of bikesharing docks remains our preferred measure for a number of reasons. first, we do not expect the impact to be the same for a bus route that is near only one bikesharing station as a bus route that has bikesharing stations along its entirety. while a dummy variable identifies routes that may be impacted, it is a rather coarse measure considering the variation in bikesharing infrastructure across the city. second, the treatment measures based on stations and on docks are highly correlated, but the measure based on docks has the advantage that it captures the variation in the size of stations and the fact that larger stations can have more bikes available. we feel this is a better reflection of being able to check out a bikesharing bicycle. finally, although the treatment measure based on bikesharing trips accounts for the variation in daily travel, we prefer to use infrastructure-based measures. using bikesharing trips as the causal variable of interest may violate the conditional independence assumption, upon which causal inference relies. for example, if an overcrowded bus prompts someone to use bikesharing, then the outcome variable (bus ridership) is actually influencing the causal variable of interest (bikesharing) instead of the other way around. if this happens we can no longer interpret the results as quantifying a causal effect of bikesharing. with the infrastructure-based measures, there is no reason to believe that variation in daily bus ridership would change the level of bikesharing infrastructure available. additionally, even though infrastructure-based measures do not reflect actual day-to-day bike availability, the number of docks is associated with actual usage (noland et al., 2016). we prefer the infrastructure-based measure of bikesharing docks to alleviate the potential reverse causality situation described, although we include results using bikesharing trips. 5.7. placebo model we also estimate a placebo difference-in-differences model. we run the same analysis as our main specification but use the time period from may 27, 2011 to may 27, 2013. we use a fictitious date of may 27, 2012 for when the bikeshare system opens, which is exactly one-year prior to the date it actually began operation. bikeopent is then an indicator if the date is on or after may 27, 2012. if the common trends assumption holds, we would expect to find no effect in this model. 5.8. alternate specification using fare type one potential problem with a difference-in-differences analysis is that factors unrelated to the opening of the bikesharing system occurring at the same time that affect the control and treatment groups in different ways could bias the results. some examples could be land use, demographic, or economic changes that occur around the same time that bikesharing opens and that impact bus ridership in lower manhattan and downtown brooklyn differently than in other areas of those boroughs. another potential concern is if the bikesharing system was implemented based on pre-existing differences in outcomes. for example, we would be concerned if the bikesharing station locations were chosen with the intent to reduce bus passenger congestion. we find no evidence of this in the planning documents. furthermore, the majority of the control area was planned for inclusion in the bikesharing system; it was only a matter of when the subsequent phases were rolled out. that means that the control and treatment areas at least met minimum density and feasibility requirements, and so are comparable across those characteristics (new york city department of city planning, 2009). we acknowledge that, from a methodological perspective, this is not as good as if the treated areas were randomly assigned and therefore, we test an alternative control and treatment. 274 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 to address these concerns about the endogeneity of the intervention itself and because we cannot control for some potential omitted variables, we use a different control and treatment group based on metrocard type. reduced fare metrocards are available to riders who are 65 years of age or older or who have a qualifying disability. in the bikesharing trip data, we have information on the biker’s age for most (89%) of the 13,118,401 trips taken during the study period. we find that only 1.19% of these bike trips were taken by persons age 65 or older.13 most people who qualify for a reduced fare metrocard due to disability are also unlikely to be bikeshare users. although we do not have exact statistics on the proportion of people who have a qualifying disability who use bikeshare, in the latest new york metropolitan regional travel survey, persons with disabilities report biking only 1.5% of the time compared to other travel modes (new york metropolitan transportation council and north jersey transportation planning authority, 2014). furthermore, many of the physical and mental disabilities that qualify someone for a reduced fare metrocard would likely prohibit him or her from riding a traditional bicycle.14 because there is very little overlap in terms of age and because many of the qualifying disabilities are likely to prevent the person from using bikesharing, we use reduced fare bus ridership as an alternative control group and compare it to full fare bus ridership as the treatment group. 13 we exclude observations where the rider was listed as being older than 105 years old. 14 a qualifying disability includes a serious mental illness for which the individual is receiving supplemental security income benefits, a hearing impairment, an ambulatory disability, loss of both hands, mental retardation and/or other organic mental capacity impairment, or applies to someone who is receiving medicare benefits for any reason other than age. for more information see the mta guide to accessible transit at http://web.mta.info/accessibility/transit.htm. fig. 6. alternative measures of treatment. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 275 looking at different groups of passengers on the same bus route alleviates the concern that bus routes that are near bikesharing stations are intrinsically different from routes that are not near bikesharing stations or that bikesharing station locations were chosen precisely because they would have a different impact on bus ridership. two groups of passengers on the same bus route would be exposed to the same demographic, land use, economic, and other location-based changes that we are unable to control for in the main specification. in this specification, we only include bus routes that are within the bikesharing area, which was defined previously as routes that have at least one bikesharing dock within 0.25 miles of the bus route. in this specification, we use the following regression equation: lnbusriderskjt ¼ a þ bbikeopent  fullfarek  docksj þ ddatefet þ hfullfarek  routefej þ kcontrols0 kjt þ ekjt ð3þ where lnbusriderskjt is the natural log of ridership for passenger type k on day t on bus route j. we use daily unlinked bus trips per route by fare type. fullfarek is an indicator for fare type, and it is 1 for full fare bus trips and 0 for reduced fare bus trips. our variable of interest is bikeopent  fullfarek  docksj, which identifies the treated group of passengers after the bikesharing system opened and is weighted by the number of bike docks (in thousands) near the bus route to take treatment intensity into account. we include date fixed effects again and add route fixed effects by fare type (fullfarek  routefej). we fig. 7. average daily bus ridership by month in manhattan and brooklyn for alternative treatment based on fare type. 276 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 use the same set of control variables, including scheduled revenue miles of bus service, the introduction of select bus service, the roll out of real-time bus information, and changes to the taxi service area. we also control for the introduction of the access-a-ride metrocard program, which provides paratransit customers with a metrocard eligible for up to four free trips per day. the program was rolled out over an 18-month period, with the first round of metrocards distributed in april 2013. we control for this using a dummy variable for reduced fare passengers on or after april 15, 2013. we also try a specification including a linear time trend by fare type and perform a placebo analysis. fig. 7 shows each month’s daily average route-level full fare and reduced fare bus ridership. the accompanying table provides descriptive statistics for the daily route-level data by borough and control and treatment groups. the two groups follow similar trends prior to the opening of the bikesharing system, although the variation is more pronounced for full fare ridership. additionally, there is a drop in full fare ridership compared to reduced fare ridership around the time the bikesharing system opened. 6. results overall, the results indicate a significant decrease in bus ridership coincident with the implementation of the bikesharing system in new york city. we find a significant decrease in daily bus ridership along routes that are near bikesharing in comparison to routes that are not. this relationship holds whether or not we control for bike lane infrastructure and is significant for manhattan and brooklyn and for manhattan alone. the result is robust to including a treatment-specific time trend and to varying the method of measuring treatment intensity. moreover, there is not a significant effect in the placebo model, which further supports our findings. results from the alternative control and treatment group based on fare type confirm the main findings. 6.1. results using geographic coverage of bikesharing column 1 of table 1 shows the results for the main specification using treatment intensity of docks for bus routes in manhattan and brooklyn. in this case, every thousand bikesharing docks along the bus route is associated with a 0.0245 reduction in the natural log of daily unlinked bus trips, or equivalently a 2.42% reduction in unlinked trips (using the equation: 100  ½eb  1). this result is significant at the 0.1 percent level. for manhattan and brooklyn the mean number of bikesharing docks near bus stops along a treated route is 1,359. for a treated route with the mean number of docks, this table 1 results of difference-in-differences regression with treatment based on geographic coverage. manhattan & brooklyn

to a 3.3% reduction in unlinked bus trips. we estimated the percent effect using the mean number of thousands of docks and the equation: 100  ½eb  1  docks. total average daily unlinked bus trips on treated routes in manhattan and brooklyn during our study period prior to bikeshare opening was 548,580. a 3.3% decrease equates to a fall in ridership of approximately 18,100 unlinked bus trips per day. in column 5 of table 1, the results for manhattan alone show that every thousand bikesharing docks along the bus route is associated with a 0.0325 reduction in the natural log of unlinked bus trips, or 3.20% of bus trips, and this result is also significant at the 0.1 percent level. this is equivalent to a 6.4% reduction in bus trips on a route with the mean number of docks, which is 2,002 for manhattan alone. average daily trips on treated routes in manhattan prior to bikeshare opening was 305,439, so this represents a fall in ridership of approximately 19,500 trips per day. the results are slightly larger in the manhattan specification where more bikesharing infrastructure is located, but the error bounds are larger as there are fewer bus routes in the sample. we also vary the time period and level of temporal aggregation and still find a significant fall in bus ridership (not shown). specifically, when we include the 2-month adjustment period (using the 12-months before and after bikesharing opened), the result is smaller and when we exclude all of 2013 (using 2012 and 2014), the result is larger. furthermore, when we use the same time period as the main specification, but aggregate to monthly-level data, we again find a significant effect that is slightly smaller (not shown). we also tried separating the effect of the bikesharing infrastructure from the effect of investing in additional bike lanes during this time by including the miles of bike lanes within 0.25 miles of each bus route over time as a control variable. as shown in columns 2 and 6 of table 1, when we include bike lanes, the effect is slightly smaller (coefficient of 0.0170 versus 0.0245 in manhattan and brooklyn; 0.0262 versus 0.0325 in manhattan alone), but the result remains significant and negative. this is a fall in bus ridership of 1.69% per thousand bikesharing docks and 2.3% for a route with the mean number of docks, which equates to 12,600 fewer daily unlinked bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn. in manhattan, there is a fall in bus ridership of 2.59% per thousand bikesharing docks, which is a fall of 5.2% on the mean route, representing 15,800 fewer daily bus trips in manhattan. as explained in section 5.4, because bike lanes is a confounding variable (and in fact the correlation between these regression coefficients is 0.47 for manhattan and brooklyn and 0.57 for manhattan), this is not our preferred specification, but it does indicate two things. first, installing both the bikesharing system with the supporting bike lane infrastructure is likely to have had a bigger impact on treated routes. second, this indicates that cycling infrastructure alone is unlikely driving the main result. however, we recommend future research consider untangling these effects. in another check of the main specification, we control for a linear time trend in bus ridership by treatment area, and this is shown in columns 3 and 7 of table 1. we find that the bikesharing effect is similar in magnitude and still significant. specifically, in manhattan and brooklyn (column 3), the coefficient of 0.0282 implies that every thousand bikesharing docks near the bus route is associated with a 2.78% reduction in unlinked bus trips (compared to a 2.42% reduction without the time trend). this is equivalent to a reduction in bus trips on a route with the mean number of bikesharing docks of 3.8% or roughly 20,800 daily bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn. for manhattan only (column 7), the results are equivalent to a 4.6% reduction in bus trips on a route with the mean number of bikesharing docks, which equates to approximately 14,000 fewer total daily unlinked bus trips. the results are similar in the specifications controlling for the miles of bike lanes (shown in columns 4 and 8 of table 1). additionally, the results are similar using a quadratic instead of a linear time trend (not shown). as can be seen in table 1, most of the control variables have the expected sign and magnitude. the coefficient on scheduled revenue miles, which is typically an important predictor of bus ridership, is large and significant. bus time real-time information is positive and sometimes significant, which generally aligns with previous findings (brakewood et al., 2015). in table 2, we show the results using other measures of treatment intensity. the results are consistent in sign and approximate magnitude with our main findings no matter which treatment definition is used, although we do not find a significant result using a dummy variable for manhattan and brooklyn (column 1). when we measure bikeshare treatment as a dummy variable for manhattan (column 4), we find that routes near at least one bikesharing station have a 6.4% decrease in unlinked bus trips. in columns 2 and 5, we find that every hundred bikesharing stations along a route is associated with a 8.32% reduction in unlinked bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn, and a 11.55% reduction in manhattan. taking the mean number of stations, these estimates are very similar in magnitude to the main specification. finally, when we measure bikeshare treatment based on the number of bikeshare trips originating near the bus route we find a smaller impact, although as noted in section 5.6, infrastructure-based measures are more appropriate given our methodology. additionally, we demonstrate that these findings are unlikely the result of a placebo effect. in the placebo model, where we used a fictitious start date for bikesharing (exactly one year prior to actual opening), we do not find a significant effect in either the manhattan and brooklyn or the manhattan only specifications. these results are shown in table 3 and suggest that the result is indeed zero when an effect should not exist. there is also no placebo effect in any of the variations including the linear time trend by treatment or controlling for bike lanes. finally, we performed a number of other analyses that yielded similar results and are therefore not shown here. we ran a model with total daily unlinked bus trips as the dependent variable instead of the natural log and found almost the same fall in ridership, although some of these results were less significant. because difference-in-differences can be sensitive to functional form and because average daily route-level ridership in our treatment is larger than the control, we prefer the specification using the natural log of ridership. in other analyses, we changed the size of the catchment area around bus stops to a half mile or to a tenth of a mile and counted the number of bikesharing docks in this radius. the results were similar to our main specification using a quarter mile catchment area. 278 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 6.2. results for alternative treatment based on fare type in the analysis using full fare ridership as the treatment group and reduced fare ridership as the control group, we also find a significant decrease in bus ridership. in column 1 of table 4, the results for manhattan and brooklyn show that every thousand bikesharing docks along the bus route is associated with a 0.0318 reduction in the natural log of full fare unlinked bus trips, or 3.13% of full fare trips, and this result is also significant at the 0.1 percent level. this is equivalent to a 4.2% reduction in full fare trips on a route with the mean number of docks. average daily full fare trips on treated routes in manhattan prior to bikeshare opening was 431,422, so this represents a fall in ridership of approximately 18,300 full fare trips per day. for manhattan only, shown in column 3, the results are smaller. in this case, there is a 2.04% fall in full fare trips per thousand docks along the route, which is equivalent to a 4.1% reduction in full fare trips on a route with the mean table 3 results

number of docks. using average daily full fare trips in manhattan of 236,330, this represents a fall in ridership of approximately 9,670 full fare trips per day. when we account for a linear time trend by treatment group (in columns 2 and 4), the estimated reduction in bus ridership remains significant and is larger. a placebo test (not shown) is not significant in any of these variations. 6.3. discussion of results through a number of specifications and tests, we find evidence that bikesharing reduced bus ridership in new york city. we included potential omitted variables such as changes to scheduled revenue miles of service and the introduction of select bus service, bus time, and boro taxis, tried a specification with a linear time trend by treatment, used alternate treatment measures, and performed a placebo test. because each of these supported our main findings, it is unlikely that the result is being driven by some general trend in the treatment group. also, limiting the sample to only bus routes that were within the bikesharing area and reproducing the result using an alternative control and treatment group by fare type demonstrates that it is unlikely that the results are being driven by something intrinsic only to the areas that received bikesharing. we discuss limitations of our findings in the following section. we presented the main specification side-by-side a specification controlling for bike lane infrastructure. methodologically it is difficult to separate the effect of opening the bikesharing system from other actions the city was taking at this time to support bicycling, such as expanding bike lanes as discussed in section 5.4. in terms of policy and planning applications, separating these effects may be less useful because in practice, municipal investment more broadly in bicycling often goes hand-in-hand with opening a bikesharing system. our main specification could potentially be interpreted as capturing this net effect; however, future research to disentangle these related factors is recommended. a final note is that, although we find that the immediate impact of bikesharing is a decline in daily bus ridership, this may not reflect the long-term impact. as pointed out by singleton and clifton (2015), even if transit and cycling are short-term substitutes, they could act as complements in the long-term. a transportation network based on a robust transit system and cycling network could impact future travel behavior, particularly long-term factors like the decision to own a car, which is not captured here. 7. areas for improvement and future research there are many areas for improvement and future research that have emerged from this study. first, a challenging aspect of this research design is controlling for all of the factors that could have affected route-level daily bus ridership during the table 4 alternate analysis with treatment based on fare type. manhattan & brooklyn

research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 study period. for example, changes in land use, population, economic activity, fares, subway service, and unscheduled changes in bus service were not included in our models. if such changes had an unequal effect in the treatment and control areas during the study period and if full fare passengers were more sensitive to these changes than reduced fare passengers, then their impact on bus ridership is not captured in our models and is an important area for improvement and future research. another factor that we do not specifically control for is the growth of new ridehailing services that were made available throughout new york city during the study period. because ridehailing data are not available prior to the opening of the bikesharing system, we cannot explicitly control for it in our models. however, if new ridehailing services impact bus ridership similarly within the control and treatment areas, then this has been accounted for in our main specification. if ridehailing has an uneven impact in these two areas of the city but has the same impact across full fare and reduced fare riders, then we would expect to find a large discrepancy between the main specification and the alternative treatment using fare type, which we do not. furthermore, if ridehailing has a different impact across the areas but follows a linear growth trend, then it could already be captured in the model that includes a time trend by treatment area. while we have utilized these strategies in an attempt to capture the impacts of ridehailing on bus ridership, we believe that this is an important area for future study, particularly in light of emerging ridehailing data availability. important areas for future research that have emerged from this work include studying other impacts that bikesharing systems could have on bus systems and on the transit system more broadly. first, reductions in bus ridership associated with the availability of bikesharing could have caused decreases in bus operating costs or revenue from bus passenger fares; this could have positive or negative implications for the transit agency and should be explored further. similarly, reductions in bus ridership during peak hours could result in decreased crowding on some of the most heavily trafficked bus routes in new york city, which could improve the quality of service from the passenger perspective. furthermore, as more travelers choose to bike using either bikesharing or personal bicycles, there could be impacts on the operations of vehicles on local roadways, including buses, due to the lower travel speeds of non-motorized modes. therefore, empirical investigation of the relationship between bus and bicycle speeds is recommended. each of these could have redistributive impacts and equity implications that have yet to be studied. future research should also quantify the impact of bikesharing on subway ridership in new york city. because the subway travels at different speeds and has larger distances between stops, it is unlikely to have the same relationship with bikesharing as the bus system. additionally, because new york city has a much denser bikesharing system and a more heavily used bus system, future research should also study the relationship between bus and bikeshare in small and medium sized cities. finally, the broader planning and public policy implications of this research should be considered. if both buses and bikes are considered shared transportation modes, questions of finance and subsidies will naturally be raised. in particular, our findings could suggest different arrangements for public-private partnership in which the impacts to municipal transit agencies are included. 8. policy implications and conclusion in this study, we quantified the effect that opening a bikesharing system has on bus ridership by exploiting a natural experiment afforded by the phased implementation of bikesharing in areas of new york city. the results indicate a significant decrease in bus ridership coincident with the implementation of the bikesharing system. our preferred model suggests that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42% reduction in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn. this represents a total daily fall in bus ridership of approximately 18,100. in the second model that additionally controls for bike lane infrastructure during this time, we find a smaller reduction due to bikesharing of 1.69%, or approximately 12,600 fewer daily bus trips. based on both model results, the overall ridership impacts were surprisingly large. considering that total average daily bikeshare trips are approximately 26,000 during the study period, our estimates of a decrease of 18,100 or 12,600 daily unlinked bus trips are sizable. if this effect is driven entirely by direct modal substitution of bikeshare members, then, even in the case where we separately control for bike lane infrastructure, it would mean that close to 50% of trips now made by bikeshare were previously made by bus. the model without bike lanes suggests that approximately 70% of bikeshare members may be substituting bikeshare for bus use. these percentages are higher than has been found in surveys of bikeshare members in other cities (shaheen et al., 2013). previous research suggests that the denser the bikesharing network and the denser the urban form, the more bikeshare members substitute biking for public transit (martin and shaheen, 2014). at the time of this writing, new york city’s bikesharing system is denser than the north american cities previously surveyed, so it is not surprising that it is in the higher end of estimates. however, this proportion of modal substitution is so large that we speculate that a considerable portion of the fall in bus ridership comes from an impact on non-members of bikeshare. it could be that people who are not bikeshare members have increased private cycling trips in lieu of bus trips. because our results indicate that the effect could be substantial, we recommend further study to investigate how bikesharing systems influence the travel behavior of non-members. finally, having a negative impact on bus ridership should not be a deterrent to implementing or expanding bikeshare schemes. in fact, the number of people who use bikesharing in new york city is a testament to its success at increasing urban mobility. instead, the knowledge of how these systems are interrelated is vital for planning a mutually reinforcing sustainable transport network. by quantifying the net effect of bikesharing, we hope our findings provide planners and k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 281 policymakers with more information on which to base future planning decisions to facilitate coordination of multimodal transportation. we hope that a better understanding of the relationship between these two different modes encourages agencies who traditionally operate separately to create more integrated systems that support the reality of multimodal,

r a c t the objective of this research is to quantify the impact that bikesharing systems have on bus ridership. we exploit a natural experiment of the phased implementation of a bikesharing system to different areas of new york city. this allows us to use a difference-indifferences identification strategy. we divide bus routes into control and treatment groups based on if they are located in areas that received bikesharing infrastructure or not. we find a significant decrease in bus ridership on treated routes compared to control routes that coincides with the implementation of the bikesharing system in new york city. the results from our preferred model indicate that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42% fall in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn. a second model that also controls for the expansion of bike lanes during this time suggests that the decrease in bus ridership attributable to bikesharing infrastructure alone may be smaller (a 1.69% fall in daily unlinked bus trips). although the magnitude of the reduction is a small proportion of total bus trips, these findings indicate that either a large proportion of overall bikeshare members are substituting bikesharing for bus trips or that bikesharing may have impacted the travel behavior of non-members, such as private bicyclists. understanding how bikesharing and public transit systems are interrelated is vital for planning a mutually reinforcing sustainable transport network.  2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. 1. introduction over the last decade, bikesharing systems have rapidly expanded throughout the united states (fishman et al., 2013; shaheen et al., 2014). however, it remains unclear how this mode of shared transportation interacts with pre-existing public transit systems. in particular, the overall impact on transit ridership has yet to be quantified. for this study we focus specifically on the impact that opening a bikesharing system had on daily bus ridership in new york city. there are a number of possible ways that bikesharing could impact bus ridership. as a direct effect, a bikesharing system may be a substitute or a complement to the pre-existing bus network. for example, a person could use bikesharing in lieu of a trip they would have taken by bus. this kind of substitution would result in a loss of bus ridership at a rate of one-to-one. alternatively, a person could use bikesharing in addition to public transit, which is commonly referred to as solving the firstand last- mile problem (shaheen et al., 2010). this complementary situation could lead to an increase in bus ridership. as a http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2017.04.017 0965-8564/ 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. ⇑

sciencedirect transportation research part a journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/tra third option, bikesharing may generate new trips, such as for recreational use, which would not impact bus ridership. for different users or at different times, bikesharing and buses could be interrelated in any of these three ways. an important, but often overlooked, aspect is the indirect effect that a bikesharing system may have on the travel behavior of non-members. there are numerous possible indirect effects. for example, if bikeshare users substitute away from buses, a reduction in bus passengers and crowding could encourage a new group of travelers to begin riding the bus, which could minimize the overall impact on bus ridership. in another scenario, opening a bikesharing system could encourage people to ride private bicycles more, particularly if they now perceive the city to be more bike-friendly. if these trips would otherwise have been made by bus, then there could be a reduction in bus ridership at a rate greater than one-to-one. the ways that bikesharing could impact how non-members travel remains largely unexplored, and it is currently unknown what this net effect of bikesharing is on bus ridership. in this study, we measure the impact that opening a bikesharing system had on the bus network in new york city (nyc) using daily route-level bus ridership data. because the bikesharing system, citi bike, had a phased implementation, we treat it like a natural experiment. we divide bus routes into control and treatment groups based on if they were in the areas that received bikesharing stations or not. a difference-in-differences regression model allows us to isolate the effects of the introduction of bikesharing from other area, group, and time effects and establish a causal link between bikesharing and bus ridership. estimates from our preferred model indicate that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42% reduction in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn. in a second model that also controls for bike lane infrastructure, we find a 1.69% reduction in bus trips. these results are statistically significant and hold under a variety of specifications. the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section 2 provides an overview of previous research and gaps in the existing literature. section 3 provides background to understand the natural experiment and identification strategy. section 4 describes the data we use, and section 5 describes how we construct the control and treatment groups and the regression methodology. in section 6, we present the results. section 7 describes limitations and future research areas. we discuss the implications of the findings and conclude in section 8. 2. prior research in a literature review on bikesharing, fishman et al. (2013) identify two themes that pertain to the relationship between bikeshare and public transit: modal integration and modal substitution. modal integration focuses on the location of bikeshare infrastructure near transit stations so that passengers can use bikeshare in conjunction with transit. modal substitution refers to trips made by bikeshare that were previously made by transit. in another recent literature review, ricci (2015) notes that more attention has been paid to understanding how much bikesharing shifts people away from the automobile and that the results regarding public transit are mixed. we have found that there are a limited number of studies that pertain to these two transit-related themes; the most relevant ones are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. in terms of modal integration, bikeshare operators typically locate stations close to transit stops to facilitate transfers between the two modes. numerous studies have found that variables relating to public transit can be a significant predictor of bikeshare usage (fishman et al., 2014; hampshire and marla, 2012; nair et al., 2013; rixey, 2013; sato et al., 2015). in new york city, bikesharing stations that are located near subway stations, particularly stations with a high number of average monthly subway boardings, saw higher bikeshare usage (noland et al., 2016). these findings suggest that there could be a complementary relationship between bikesharing and transit, although for new york city, this relationship has only been explored for the subway and remains unknown for the bus system. regarding modal substitution, bikeshare member surveys typically find that many people reduce their bus use as a result of bikesharing, although the size of the effect varies across cities and even within a city (buck et al., 2013; fuller et al., 2013; murphy and usher, 2015; shaheen et al., 2011; shaheen et al., 2013; tang et al., 2011). in a survey of montreal, washington d.c., toronto, and the twin cities, 17% to 47% of respondents reported that they decreased their bus usage as a result of bikesharing, although within these same cities 2% to 14% reported increasing their bus usage. even though they found an overall substitutionary effect, there were members using bikeshare as a complement to buses as well (shaheen et al., 2013). in subsequent research, martin and shaheen (2014) found that bikeshare members in washington d.c. living in the urban core were more likely to report decreases in bus use as a result of bikesharing, while respondents living in the urban periphery were more likely to report increases. however, this relationship did not hold in minneapolis, where respondents reported increasing and decreasing usage in almost equal proportion whether they lived in the urban core or periphery. the authors posit that bikesharing is more likely to act as a complement in cities with lower population density and less dense transit networks. similarly, another survey in montreal found that the majority of bikeshare users shifted away from public transit. they also asked non-users about their travel behavior and found that 3% of respondents who do not use bikeshare reported shifting to public transit as a result of bikesharing (fuller et al., 2013). they confirmed their hypothesis that, as a large-scale change in the built environment, bikesharing could have impacts on active travel beyond the direct effect on bikeshare members. while there are no publicly available surveys of bikeshare members in new york city, survey results from other cities begin to quantify the proportion of bikeshare users who may have a direct impact on transit ridership by changing their travel behavior; however, these studies do not quantify the magnitude of that impact in terms of total transit trips gained or lost. in addition, the surveys of only bikeshare members are unable to capture indirect effects on transit from changes to the k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 265 travel behavior of non-members, although there is some evidence that demonstrates that bikesharing systems can have broader indirect effects. there are two noteworthy prior studies that examine the magnitude of the impact of bikeshare on transit ridership. the first examined the impact of bikesharing on rail ridership in washington d.c., which had the second largest bikesharing system in the united states at the time. using regression analysis, the authors found that a 10% increase in bikeshare trips is associated with a 2.8% increase in metrorail ridership (ma et al., 2015). although they find a significant relationship, the cross-sectional study design makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of bikesharing from other trends in rail ridership, and it is possible that other trends in rail ridership could have driven the effect. the second noteworthy study, which is perhaps the most relevant reference for this research, is a study on the impacts of real-time transit information on bus ridership in new york city (brakewood et al., 2015). the study analyzed route-level weekday average bus ridership per month over a three year period from 2011 to 2013 using panel regression. the availability of bikesharing was modeled as a binary control variable for all bus routes in manhattan and brooklyn after the bikesharing program commenced, and the authors found that it had a significant, negative effect on route-level bus ridership (over 500 daily bus trips per route in manhattan and approximately 375 daily bus trips per route in brooklyn). however, the authors note that the magnitude of the coefficient appeared to be unrealistically large. performing a back of the envelope calculation, the reduction in bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn would be equivalent to very large percentage (almost all) of bikesharing systems average weekday ridership in 2013. therefore, the authors recommended further study to better understand the complex relationship between bus ridership and bikesharing. by quantifying the impact that bikesharing has on bus ridership, we contribute to the literature in the following ways. first, our research design is better suited for quantifying a causal relationship than geospatial and cross-sectional studies. second, we study the impact to buses, which has been largely overlooked in prior studies that have focused on rail systems. third, we capture aggregate level impacts to the transit network. although surveys provide a good assessment of the causal way bikeshare users alter their travel behavior, they typically do not capture indirect effects of the behavioral change of nonmembers, and they require a number of assumptions to estimate the net impacts to transit ridership. furthermore, we account for the varying intensity of bikesharing infrastructure, an improvement over studies using a dummy variable to capture the effect. finally, this relationship has not been well studied in new york city, which has the largest public transit system and largest bikesharing system in the united states at the time of this writing. 3. background in the following paragraphs, we provide background information about the bus and bikesharing systems in new york city. then we compare the two systems based on their prices, ridership trends, and trip characteristics. last, we describe specific transportation changes that were happening in new york city at this time. 3.1. bus service in new york city new york city is composed of five boroughs: manhattan, brooklyn, the bronx, queens, and staten island. most local bus service is operated by new york city transit (nyct) under the umbrella organization of the metropolitan transportation authority (mta). nyct operates the largest bus system in the country, which, in 2013, accounted for almost 15% of unlinked passenger bus trips nationwide and over 85% of trips in new york city (american public transportation association, 2015).1 the nyct bus system includes approximately 200 fixed routes. this study focuses on 85 bus routes located in the boroughs of manhattan (34 routes) and brooklyn (51 routes). 3.2. bikeshare in new york city new york city’s bikesharing network is the densest in the united states with 19.7 bikesharing stations per square mile compared to 6.8 in chicago and 4.4 in the district of columbia (gordon-koven and levenson, 2014). phase 1 of the bikesharing system opened on may 27, 2013 with a dense network of stations in southern manhattan and downtown brooklyn, while the rest of the city received no bikesharing infrastructure. as explained in section 5, we use the uneven geographic coverage to split the city into control and treatment areas, and within the treatment area, we quantify the amount of bikesharing infrastructure available. each bikesharing station has a number of bike docks where a user can lock or unlock an individual bike. fig. 1 shows the location of stations and the amount of docks at each station, highlighting how the density of docks and stations varies. the number of docks per station varies from 3 to 62 with manhattan having a slightly higher mean number of docks per station than brooklyn. the total number of bikesharing stations in manhattan is also higher at 262 compared to 82 in brooklyn. the vast majority of bikeshare trips (over 90%) are taken by annual members (kaufman et al., 2015), who provide basic demographic information, including age and gender, at the time of registration. during our study period, the median age for 1 the remaining were trips on routes operated by the mta bus company. because the mta bus company operates primarily in queens, we do not include these routes in our study. 266 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 bikeshare trips taken by annual members was 35 years old and 77.7% of those trips were taken by men. in contrast, the median age for bus passengers in the new york city region is higher and a larger proportion are female (new york metropolitan transportation council and north jersey transportation planning authority, 2014; seltzer, 2014). 3.3. bus and bikeshare prices to ride the bus, passengers pay with cash or use a metrocard, which works on nyct and mta bus company buses and the subway. there are a variety of payment options and fees, including single-ride tickets, unlimited period passes, discounts for larger purchases, fees to obtain a new metrocard, reduced fare passes for disabled or elderly passengers, free fares for students, and a number of other payment options. on march 3, 2013 (approximately three months prior to the opening of the bikeshare system), the base bus fare rose from $2.25 to $2.50, the price of a 7-day unlimited metrocard rose from $29 to $30, and the cost of a 30-day unlimited metrocard rose from $104 to $112. to use a bikeshare bicycle, riders have three options to pay: a 24-hour pass costing $9.95, a 7-day pass costing $25, or an annual membership costing $95. this means that the oneweek cost is similar across the two systems at $25 and $30, but that the annual cost for unlimited trips is much higher on the bus ($95 for an annual bikeshare membership and up to $1,344 for twelve unlimited monthly bus passes). 3.4. bus and bikeshare ridership, speed, and trip distances both the bus and bikeshare systems in new york city exhibit strong daily and seasonal ridership trends. both systems have higher ridership on weekdays than weekends with peaks during the morning and afternoon commutes (new york fig. 1. location of bikesharing stations and number of docks. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 267 city department of transportation, 2016; schneider, 2016). bikeshare trips are high from mid-may to mid-october, while bus ridership is high in the fall and spring. during our study period from may 27, 2012 to july 26, 2014 (excluding a two-month adjustment period after bikesharing opened), daily bikeshare trips ranged from a minimum of 978 to a maximum of 45,667 with an average of 26,072 daily bikeshare trips. there were 951,176 average daily unlinked bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn during this time, which is an order of magnitude larger than daily bikeshare ridership. daily bus route-level ridership ranged from a minimum of 279 to a maximum of 48,785, with a mean of 11,231 daily unlinked trips per route. average daily bus ridership has been declining, such that citywide bus ridership fell 2% between 2014 and 2015, with ridership in manhattan falling by 6% in 2014, according to the new york city department of transportation (2016). we can see this slight decline in fig. 2, which show the average daily ridership per month during the study period for all bus routes in manhattan and brooklyn and for the bikeshare system. during our study period, average bikeshare speed was 8.4 mph and average trip distance was 1.7 miles. according to estimates from the new york city department of transportation (2016), average bus speed is frequently over 10 mph, particularly on arterial roads between neighborhoods, but is often 4 mph or less in central business districts like midtown manhattan. one example given by new york university’s rudin center estimates that ‘‘a mile-long bus trip across 34th street could take more than 20 minutes but a citi bike cuts the same trip down to 10 minutes or less, depending on the rider” (kaufman et al., 2015). the bikesharing and bus systems in new york city are comparable across a number of characteristics, although there are some instances where bikesharing may be more efficient. because of the similarity in travel speeds, we hypothesize that bikesharing may act as a substitute for bus trips in new york city. additionally, because daily bus ridership is magnitudes larger than daily bikeshare ridership, we do not expect to find a sizable impact on overall bus ridership. instead, quantifying the size of the effect can tell us more about the degree to which these systems interact with one another in new york city. 3.5. changes to the transportation network finally, there were other transportation changes happening during this time that are worth noting. first, bicycling was growing in new york city. in 2014, 25% of new yorkers reported that they rode a bike a least once in the past year. annual 0 50000 100000 average daily bikeshare trips 0 100000 200000

brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 cycling trips went from 98.6 million in 2011 to 153.3 million in 2014 (new york city department of transportation, 2017). during the same time period, new york city increased investment in bicycle infrastructure including bike lanes, bike signage, and signals, and in 2013 opened a bikeshare system. additionally, select bus service (sbs) was introduced on a small number of bus routes during the study period. sbs is a form of rapid bus service where passengers pay before boarding the bus, and buses have designated travel lanes and traffic signal priority in some areas. another change was the introduction of bus time, which provides passengers with real-time bus information via web-based and mobile interfaces; this was rolled out to some routes during the study period. a third change that happened to the broader transportation system during this time was the introduction of the boro taxi program, which allowed for-hire vehicles (besides yellow taxis) to pick up street hail passengers anywhere in the five boroughs except in the manhattan core (south of east 96th and west 110th st) (new york city taxi and limousine commission, 2013). a reduced fare metrocard program, referred to as access-a-ride, was also changed during the study period. furthermore, ridehailing services, such as uber and lyft, began operating in new york city in 2011 and grew in popularity during this time. these noteworthy transportation network changes are explained further in section 5. 4. data sources bus data were made available through a request to nyct. the data include daily unlinked bus trips per route, daily unlinked bus trips by route split by fare type used (full, reduced, or student fare), and scheduled revenue miles per route. from the scheduled revenue miles data and from mta press releases, we have information about when certain routes began operating select bus service, when they began offering bus time real-time information, and when the access-a-ride metro- card program was introduced. we use any route that primarily serves manhattan or brooklyn based on the bus route name, 2 but we exclude express routes and routes that pass into manhattan or brooklyn but primarily serve other boroughs. we combine a small number of bus routes that operate on sections of the same right-of-way and are scheduled together.3 additionally, we exclude dates when subway or bus service was canceled due to severe weather.4 we use publicly available data with the latitude and longitude of each bus stop along all nyct bus routes as of june 2015.5 the models presented in the following section were also tested using the latitude and longitude of each bus stop as of 2010, with no significant change in the results. we imported this data into arcgis using the display gtfs route shapes tool6 and used arcgis software by esri version 10.3.1 and the light gray canvas basemap to generate the maps presented here.7 citi bike data are publicly available.8 we downloaded daily total ridership and membership data for the period may 27, 2013 (the launch date) to december 31, 2014. additionally, we downloaded trip history data for the same period that includes the date and station location (latitude and longitude) where each bike trip begins. finally, we downloaded the citi bike station feed data that includes the number of docks at each bike station.9 a map of the boro taxi service area and launch date is publicly available from the new york city taxi and limousine commission (2013). miles of bike lanes and date built came from the new york city cycling map shapefile published annually by the new york city department of transportation.10 5. methodology this section describes the methodology, beginning with how we divide the bus routes into a control and treatment group based on variation in geographic coverage of the bikesharing network in section 5.1. next, we describe the difference-indifferences identification technique in section 5.2 and how it can be estimated using ordinary least squares regression in section 5.3.we present visual evidence that bus ridership is falling on routes in the treatment compared to the control when treatment is defined by geographic coverage of bikeshare. in sections 5.4–5.7, we explain variations to the main specification that address the robustness of the model including controlling for cycling infrastructure, controlling for a time trend in the treated group, changing the way we quantify treatment intensity, and performing a placebo analysis. finally, in section 5.8, we present a model using an alternative control and treatment group based on the type of bus fare payment used. this alternate model addresses some concerns about the endogeneity of the intervention itself and additional potential omitted variables. 2 in the naming convention for bus routes in new york city, the first letter of the bus route name typically refers to the borough in which the bus operates. 3 we combined the m102 and m103 with the m101, the m16 with the m34, and the b69 with the b67. 4 we exclude 8/27/2011–8/29/2011 (hurricane irene) and 10/28/2012–11/8/2012 (superstorm sandy). 5 bus stop location data were made available by the metropolitan transportation authority and downloaded from their developer data webpage: http://web. mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html. 6 the display gtfs routes shapes was created by melinda morang at esri and was downloaded from http://transit.melindamorang.com. 7 basemaps in all the images are the light gray canvas map by esri, delorme, here, and mapmyindia. 8 citi bike system data were made available by the operator of new york’s bikesharing service, nyc bike share, llc and motivate international, inc., and were downloaded from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. 9 to calculate the number of docks per station we used the average number of docks listed from daily live feed data averaged over the period from july 2013 through december 2014. in rare cases where data on the number of docks was missing, we assumed that these stations had the mean number of docks for the sample. 10 available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#bikes. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 269 5.1. definition of treatment based on intensity of geographic coverage of bikesharing one contribution of this research is quantifying the interrelationship between the bikesharing and bus systems based on the intensity of bikesharing infrastructure. as described in section 3 and shown in fig. 1, the number of stations and the number of docks at each station varies considerably.we develop a treatment measure based on the number of docks located near each bus route to capture the potential availability of a bikeshare bicycle. using data on bus route and bikesharing station locations, we count the number of bikesharing docks that fall within a 0.25 mile catchment area of the bus route. a quarter mile is commonly used by transit planners as the distance people will walk to reach a bus stop (walker, 2012). fig. 3 provides an illustration of how this measure is calculated along one example route, the m23 bus. in the figure, the bus route is shown in black, the catchment area is in orange, the bikesharing stations are light blue, and the bikesharing stations that fall within the catchment area are indicated by an orange outline. the circled number indicates how many docks are at each bikesharing station. we sum the number of docks over the entire route. in this example, there are a total of 1,172 docks along the m23 bus route. this treatment variable captures the fact that larger stations can have more bikes available, which better reflects the variation in intensity of bikeshare infrastructure. fig. 4 shows this treatment measure for all the bus routes in the sample. we test a few alternate treatment variables as described in section 5.6. 5.2. difference-in-differences research design the natural experiment afforded by the phased roll out of bikesharing allows us to use a difference-in-differences identification strategy. a difference-in-differences model uses panel data to compare the outcome in one group that receives treatment to a control group during the study period in an attempt to quantify the causal impact of a policy. the difference between the two groups before the policy went into effect is subtracted from the difference between the two groups after the policy went into effect. the difference of these two differences (hence the name) is the estimated effect of the policy. take for example, ridership (busridersjat) on bus route j in area a at time t. let bus routes in northern manhattan be the control group (a ¼ n), bus routes in southern manhattan be the treatment group (a ¼ s), one time period before the bikesharing system opened (t ¼ 0), and one time period after it opened (t ¼ 1). the average treatment effect is given by: ðe½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 1  e½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 0þ  ðe½busridersjat ja ¼ n; t ¼ 1  e½busridersjat ja ¼ n; t ¼ 0þ ¼ b ð1þ here, b is the causal effect of interest and, as described in the next section, it can be estimated using ordinary least squares regression. the major advantage of this identification strategy is that it removes biases caused by the permanent differences between the control and treatment groups, as well as biases caused by time trends impacting the entire sample. for example, if bus routes in the treated area consistently have higher ridership than routes in the control area, this will be washed out in the first difference (e½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 1  e½busridersjat ja ¼ s; t ¼ 0) so that route size will not have a net effect on b. any characteristics of the control or treatment group that do not change over time are accounted for in this way. this is important because there are differences between population groups in terms of race, income, and education in areas that received bikesharing compared to nearby areas in new york city (ursaki and aultman-hall, 2016). similarly, this methodology controls for changes that happen over time and have the same impact to both groups. for example, if citywide population growth causes ridership to increase by a constant in the second period in both the control and treatment groups, taking the difference of the differences would result in a net effect of zero from the population increase. this example demonstrates the second feature of difference-in-differences, which is that time-varying factors that affect both groups can be accounted for by the second difference. 59 31 37 33 49 27 35 42

opened and impact the treatment group differently than the control group. whenever possible, we account for these types of potential omitted variables by adding control variables to the model. another concern is endogeneity of the intervention itself; in fig. 4. treatment variable based on the number of bikesharing docks along the bus route. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 271 other words, if the treatment area was chosen precisely because it would have a different impact on bus ridership. to address these concerns, we also use an alternative way of splitting the sample into control and treatment groups as a robustness check in section 5.8. 5.3. regression methodology using geographic coverage of bikesharing we can use ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effect of bikesharing on bus ridership based on the geographic coverage of bikesharing. we generalize the basic two-period and two-group difference-in-differences model discussed in the previous section to include multiple time periods and groups and to account for the intensity of bikesharing treatment. our preferred model takes the following form: lnbusridersjt ¼ a þ bbikeopent  bikeareaj  docksj þ ddatefet þ croutefej þ kcontrols0 jt þ ejt ð2þ here, lnbusridersjt is the natural log of ridership on day t on bus route j, and we use total daily unlinked bus trips per route on buses operated by nyct from may 27, 2012 to july 26, 2014, excluding a two-month bikeshare adjustment period from may 27, 2013 to july 26, 2013. we estimate the model for manhattan and brooklyn combined and for manhattan alone. we take the natural log of bus ridership because the pre-treatment average levels of daily bus ridership in the treatment group are much higher than in the control group. since the difference-in-differences effect is sensitive to functional form, we use the natural log of the differences to prevent changes in ridership on routes with larger total ridership from obscuring the effect. bikeopent is an indicator if the date is on or after may 27, 2013, which is when the bikesharing system opened. there are 354 days in the control period and 365 days in the treatment period (11 days in the control period were excluded due to severe service changes from superstorm sandy). bikeareaj is an indicator if any part of the bus route is near a bikesharing station. our variable of interest is bikeopent  bikeareaj  docksj, which is the interaction of bikeopent and bikeareaj weighted by docksj, a variable measuring the number of bike docks (in thousands) near the bus route. this variable identifies routes in the treatment area after the bikesharing system opened weighted by the intensity of bikeshare docking infrastructure. construction of this variable was explained in section 5.1 and alternate measures of treatment intensity are described in section 5.6. we include date fixed effects (datefet ), which control for daily system-wide variation, and route fixed effects (routefej), which control for characteristics of each route that do not vary over time. controls0 jt is a vector of area- and time- varying characteristics, described in the next paragraph. the residual error term is ejt . because of the potential for serial correlation across dates in this long time series, we use bootstrap standard errors (bertrand et al., 2004). we also cluster the standard errors at the bus route level (cameron and miller, 2015). estimations were completed in stata versions 12 and 14 and a number of packages were used.11 the vector controls0 jt includes variables for scheduled revenue miles of bus service, the introduction of select bus service, the roll out of real-time bus information, and the introduction of the boro taxi program. we include the natural log of total scheduled revenue miles, which captures the total miles that buses on a particular route are scheduled to travel that day while in revenue service. the level of bus service is an important predictor of bus ridership (evans et al., 2004). it takes into account differences in route length and frequency of service between routes and provides an indication of the level of service available each season.12 for select bus service, we include a dummy variable to indicate if any bus along a route was operating as sbs that day. regarding real-time bus information, we include a dummy variable to indicate if that bus route had bus time on that day. changes to the taxi service were modeled using a dummy variable for any route that has stops within the boro taxi service area for dates on or after august 8, 2013, which is when the first boro taxi ride occurred. an identifying assumption for our analysis is that, in the absence of treatment, the trend in the treatment group would follow the same trend as the control group. in fig. 5 we provide graphical evidence showing that prior to the bikesharing system opening, ridership in the control and treatment groups were following parallel trends. this figure shows the trend in average daily route-level bus ridership for each month with the study period of may 27, 2012 to may 26, 2013 (pre) and july 27, 2013 to july 26, 2014 (post) indicated by the gray boxes. the treatment group shown here includes bus routes in manhattan or brooklyn that have at least one bikesharing dock within 0.25 miles of the route, and the control group includes bus routes that are not near any bikesharing docks. we see in the graph and accompanying table that treatment routes have higher average ridership than control routes, that the groups are following a similar trend prior to bikeshare opening, and that there is a decrease in average bus trips in the treatment group compared to the control group after the bikesharing system opens (indicated by the vertical dashed line in the graph). 5.4. cycling infrastructure in a similar timeframe as the opening of the bikesharing system, new york city was investing in cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes and signals. cycling infrastructure has been shown to have a positive relationship with levels of private 11 packages used include carryforward (kantor, 2004), erepost (jann, 2005), estout (jann, 2007), and nearstat (jeanty, 2010). stata statistical software by statacorp (2015). 12 nyct sets scheduled revenue miles per route for each pick, which is similar to season and runs roughly from january-march, april-june, july-august, and september-december. 272 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 cycling (pucher and buehler, 2011), which could, in turn, also impact bus ridership. in the 12 months prior to opening the bikesharing system, 31 miles of bike lanes were installed with 18 miles located in the same area as the bikesharing system. in the 14 months after the bikesharing system opened, 55 more miles of bike lanes were installed including 7 miles in the bikesharing area. in our main specification, we do not separate this potential effect; however, in a second specification, we test how much of the result is being driven by cycling infrastructure and how much is being driven by bikesharing infrastructure by controlling for bike lanes. specifically we include a control variable for the miles of bike lanes that are within 0.25 miles of each bus route over the course of the study period using the date that the bike lane was installed. in terms of the differencein- differences identification strategy, bike lanes is a potential omitted variable because the amount of cycling infrastructure varied across the control and treatment areas during our study period. however, in our regression framework it is a confounding variable. because it is highly correlated with our variable of interest, including it as a control makes it difficult fig. 5. average daily bus ridership by month in manhattan and brooklyn on control and treatment routes based on geographic coverage. k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 273 to untangle the impact that bike lanes had on bus ridership from the impact of the bikesharing system. therefore, we present this analysis to confirm that it is not driving our main result. 5.5. time trend we want to rule out the possibility that our results are being driven by some general downward trend in bus ridership on treated routes. to do so, we include a linear time trend interacted with the indicator for treated routes, bikeareaj , in some of our model specifications. both a linear and quadratic trend were fit, but because the results are similar only the linear time trend is presented. while this variable could account for any number of trends specific to the treatment group, we were particularly concerned that ridehailing services, such as uber, may be impacting bus ridership more in the treatment group. because we do not have the data to explicitly model ridehailing for the duration of our study period, we use this specification as another check of the main result. 5.6. other measures of treatment intensity in addition to our preferred treatment measure based the intensity of bikesharing dock infrastructure near bus routes, we develop three alternative treatment measures. the first alternative treatment measure is a dummy variable that is equal to one if the bus route is within a 0.25 mile radius of at least one bikesharing dock, and zero otherwise. the second alternative treatment measure is the total number of bikesharing stations within 0.25 miles of the bus route. this is similar to the treatment measure based on docks. our third alternative treatment measure is the number of bikesharing trips originating within 0.25 miles of the bus route each day. this last measure varies daily, while the rest of the measures are constant over time. fig. 6(a)–(c) shows each of these treatment measures for routes in the sample. the treatment measure based on the number of bikesharing docks remains our preferred measure for a number of reasons. first, we do not expect the impact to be the same for a bus route that is near only one bikesharing station as a bus route that has bikesharing stations along its entirety. while a dummy variable identifies routes that may be impacted, it is a rather coarse measure considering the variation in bikesharing infrastructure across the city. second, the treatment measures based on stations and on docks are highly correlated, but the measure based on docks has the advantage that it captures the variation in the size of stations and the fact that larger stations can have more bikes available. we feel this is a better reflection of being able to check out a bikesharing bicycle. finally, although the treatment measure based on bikesharing trips accounts for the variation in daily travel, we prefer to use infrastructure-based measures. using bikesharing trips as the causal variable of interest may violate the conditional independence assumption, upon which causal inference relies. for example, if an overcrowded bus prompts someone to use bikesharing, then the outcome variable (bus ridership) is actually influencing the causal variable of interest (bikesharing) instead of the other way around. if this happens we can no longer interpret the results as quantifying a causal effect of bikesharing. with the infrastructure-based measures, there is no reason to believe that variation in daily bus ridership would change the level of bikesharing infrastructure available. additionally, even though infrastructure-based measures do not reflect actual day-to-day bike availability, the number of docks is associated with actual usage (noland et al., 2016). we prefer the infrastructure-based measure of bikesharing docks to alleviate the potential reverse causality situation described, although we include results using bikesharing trips. 5.7. placebo model we also estimate a placebo difference-in-differences model. we run the same analysis as our main specification but use the time period from may 27, 2011 to may 27, 2013. we use a fictitious date of may 27, 2012 for when the bikeshare system opens, which is exactly one-year prior to the date it actually began operation. bikeopent is then an indicator if the date is on or after may 27, 2012. if the common trends assumption holds, we would expect to find no effect in this model. 5.8. alternate specification using fare type one potential problem with a difference-in-differences analysis is that factors unrelated to the opening of the bikesharing system occurring at the same time that affect the control and treatment groups in different ways could bias the results. some examples could be land use, demographic, or economic changes that occur around the same time that bikesharing opens and that impact bus ridership in lower manhattan and downtown brooklyn differently than in other areas of those boroughs. another potential concern is if the bikesharing system was implemented based on pre-existing differences in outcomes. for example, we would be concerned if the bikesharing station locations were chosen with the intent to reduce bus passenger congestion. we find no evidence of this in the planning documents. furthermore, the majority of the control area was planned for inclusion in the bikesharing system; it was only a matter of when the subsequent phases were rolled out. that means that the control and treatment areas at least met minimum density and feasibility requirements, and so are comparable across those characteristics (new york city department of city planning, 2009). we acknowledge that, from a methodological perspective, this is not as good as if the treated areas were randomly assigned and therefore, we test an alternative control and treatment. 274 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 to address these concerns about the endogeneity of the intervention itself and because we cannot control for some potential omitted variables, we use a different control and treatment group based on metrocard type. reduced fare metrocards are available to riders who are 65 years of age or older or who have a qualifying disability. in the bikesharing trip data, we have information on the biker’s age for most (89%) of the 13,118,401 trips taken during the study period. we find that only 1.19% of these bike trips were taken by persons age 65 or older.13 most people who qualify for a reduced fare metrocard due to disability are also unlikely to be bikeshare users. although we do not have exact statistics on the proportion of people who have a qualifying disability who use bikeshare, in the latest new york metropolitan regional travel survey, persons with disabilities report biking only 1.5% of the time compared to other travel modes (new york metropolitan transportation council and north jersey transportation planning authority, 2014). furthermore, many of the physical and mental disabilities that qualify someone for a reduced fare metrocard would likely prohibit him or her from riding a traditional bicycle.14 because there is very little overlap in terms of age and because many of the qualifying disabilities are likely to prevent the person from using bikesharing, we use reduced fare bus ridership as an alternative control group and compare it to full fare bus ridership as the treatment group. 13 we exclude observations where the rider was listed as being older than 105 years old. 14 a qualifying disability includes a serious mental illness for which the individual is receiving supplemental security income benefits, a hearing impairment, an ambulatory disability, loss of both hands, mental retardation and/or other organic mental capacity impairment, or applies to someone who is receiving medicare benefits for any reason other than age. for more information see

264–282 275 looking at different groups of passengers on the same bus route alleviates the concern that bus routes that are near bikesharing stations are intrinsically different from routes that are not near bikesharing stations or that bikesharing station locations were chosen precisely because they would have a different impact on bus ridership. two groups of passengers on the same bus route would be exposed to the same demographic, land use, economic, and other location-based changes that we are unable to control for in the main specification. in this specification, we only include bus routes that are within the bikesharing area, which was defined previously as routes that have at least one bikesharing dock within 0.25 miles of the bus route. in this specification, we use the following regression equation: lnbusriderskjt ¼ a þ bbikeopent  fullfarek  docksj þ ddatefet þ hfullfarek  routefej þ kcontrols0 kjt þ ekjt ð3þ where lnbusriderskjt is the natural log of ridership for passenger type k on day t on bus route j. we use daily unlinked bus trips per route by fare type. fullfarek is an indicator for fare type, and it is 1 for full fare bus trips and 0 for reduced fare bus trips. our variable of interest is bikeopent  fullfarek  docksj, which identifies the treated group of passengers after the bikesharing system opened and is weighted by the number of bike docks (in thousands) near the bus route to take treatment intensity into account. we include date fixed effects again and add route fixed effects by fare type (fullfarek  routefej). we fig. 7. average daily bus ridership by month in manhattan and brooklyn for alternative treatment based on fare type. 276 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 use the same set of control variables, including scheduled revenue miles of bus service, the introduction of select bus service, the roll out of real-time bus information, and changes to the taxi service area. we also control for the introduction of the access-a-ride metrocard program, which provides paratransit customers with a metrocard eligible for up to four free trips per day. the program was rolled out over an 18-month period, with the first round of metrocards distributed in april 2013. we control for this using a dummy variable for reduced fare passengers on or after april 15, 2013. we also try a specification including a linear time trend by fare type and perform a placebo analysis. fig. 7 shows each month’s daily average route-level full fare and reduced fare bus ridership. the accompanying table provides descriptive statistics for the daily route-level data by borough and control and treatment groups. the two groups follow similar trends prior to the opening of the bikesharing system, although the variation is more pronounced for full fare ridership. additionally, there is a drop in full fare ridership compared to reduced fare ridership around the time the bikesharing system opened. 6. results overall, the results indicate a significant decrease in bus ridership coincident with the implementation of the bikesharing system in new york city. we find a significant decrease in daily bus ridership along routes that are near bikesharing in comparison to routes that are not. this relationship holds whether or not we control for bike lane infrastructure and is significant for manhattan and brooklyn and for manhattan alone. the result is robust to including a treatment-specific time trend and to varying the method of measuring treatment intensity. moreover, there is not a significant effect in the placebo model, which further supports our findings. results from the alternative control and treatment group based on fare type confirm the main findings. 6.1. results using geographic coverage of bikesharing column 1 of table 1 shows the results for the main specification using treatment intensity of docks for bus routes in manhattan and brooklyn. in this case, every thousand bikesharing docks along the bus route is associated with a 0.0245 reduction in the natural log of daily unlinked bus trips, or equivalently a 2.42% reduction in unlinked trips (using the equation: 100  ½eb  1). this result is significant at the 0.1 percent level. for manhattan and brooklyn the mean number of bikesharing docks near bus stops along a treated route is 1,359. for a treated route with the mean number of docks, this table 1 results of difference-in-differences regression with treatment based on geographic coverage. manhattan & brooklyn

to a 3.3% reduction in unlinked bus trips. we estimated the percent effect using the mean number of thousands of docks and the equation: 100  ½eb  1  docks. total average daily unlinked bus trips on treated routes in manhattan and brooklyn during our study period prior to bikeshare opening was 548,580. a 3.3% decrease equates to a fall in ridership of approximately 18,100 unlinked bus trips per day. in column 5 of table 1, the results for manhattan alone show that every thousand bikesharing docks along the bus route is associated with a 0.0325 reduction in the natural log of unlinked bus trips, or 3.20% of bus trips, and this result is also significant at the 0.1 percent level. this is equivalent to a 6.4% reduction in bus trips on a route with the mean number of docks, which is 2,002 for manhattan alone. average daily trips on treated routes in manhattan prior to bikeshare opening was 305,439, so this represents a fall in ridership of approximately 19,500 trips per day. the results are slightly larger in the manhattan specification where more bikesharing infrastructure is located, but the error bounds are larger as there are fewer bus routes in the sample. we also vary the time period and level of temporal aggregation and still find a significant fall in bus ridership (not shown). specifically, when we include the 2-month adjustment period (using the 12-months before and after bikesharing opened), the result is smaller and when we exclude all of 2013 (using 2012 and 2014), the result is larger. furthermore, when we use the same time period as the main specification, but aggregate to monthly-level data, we again find a significant effect that is slightly smaller (not shown). we also tried separating the effect of the bikesharing infrastructure from the effect of investing in additional bike lanes during this time by including the miles of bike lanes within 0.25 miles of each bus route over time as a control variable. as shown in columns 2 and 6 of table 1, when we include bike lanes, the effect is slightly smaller (coefficient of 0.0170 versus 0.0245 in manhattan and brooklyn; 0.0262 versus 0.0325 in manhattan alone), but the result remains significant and negative. this is a fall in bus ridership of 1.69% per thousand bikesharing docks and 2.3% for a route with the mean number of docks, which equates to 12,600 fewer daily unlinked bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn. in manhattan, there is a fall in bus ridership of 2.59% per thousand bikesharing docks, which is a fall of 5.2% on the mean route, representing 15,800 fewer daily bus trips in manhattan. as explained in section 5.4, because bike lanes is a confounding variable (and in fact the correlation between these regression coefficients is 0.47 for manhattan and brooklyn and 0.57 for manhattan), this is not our preferred specification, but it does indicate two things. first, installing both the bikesharing system with the supporting bike lane infrastructure is likely to have had a bigger impact on treated routes. second, this indicates that cycling infrastructure alone is unlikely driving the main result. however, we recommend future research consider untangling these effects. in another check of the main specification, we control for a linear time trend in bus ridership by treatment area, and this is shown in columns 3 and 7 of table 1. we find that the bikesharing effect is similar in magnitude and still significant. specifically, in manhattan and brooklyn (column 3), the coefficient of 0.0282 implies that every thousand bikesharing docks near the bus route is associated with a 2.78% reduction in unlinked bus trips (compared to a 2.42% reduction without the time trend). this is equivalent to a reduction in bus trips on a route with the mean number of bikesharing docks of 3.8% or roughly 20,800 daily bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn. for manhattan only (column 7), the results are equivalent to a 4.6% reduction in bus trips on a route with the mean number of bikesharing docks, which equates to approximately 14,000 fewer total daily unlinked bus trips. the results are similar in the specifications controlling for the miles of bike lanes (shown in columns 4 and 8 of table 1). additionally, the results are similar using a quadratic instead of a linear time trend (not shown). as can be seen in table 1, most of the control variables have the expected sign and magnitude. the coefficient on scheduled revenue miles, which is typically an important predictor of bus ridership, is large and significant. bus time real-time information is positive and sometimes significant, which generally aligns with previous findings (brakewood et al., 2015). in table 2, we show the results using other measures of treatment intensity. the results are consistent in sign and approximate magnitude with our main findings no matter which treatment definition is used, although we do not find a significant result using a dummy variable for manhattan and brooklyn (column 1). when we measure bikeshare treatment as a dummy variable for manhattan (column 4), we find that routes near at least one bikesharing station have a 6.4% decrease in unlinked bus trips. in columns 2 and 5, we find that every hundred bikesharing stations along a route is associated with a 8.32% reduction in unlinked bus trips in manhattan and brooklyn, and a 11.55% reduction in manhattan. taking the mean number of stations, these estimates are very similar in magnitude to the main specification. finally, when we measure bikeshare treatment based on the number of bikeshare trips originating near the bus route we find a smaller impact, although as noted in section 5.6, infrastructure-based measures are more appropriate given our methodology. additionally, we demonstrate that these findings are unlikely the result of a placebo effect. in the placebo model, where we used a fictitious start date for bikesharing (exactly one year prior to actual opening), we do not find a significant effect in either the manhattan and brooklyn or the manhattan only specifications. these results are shown in table 3 and suggest that the result is indeed zero when an effect should not exist. there is also no placebo effect in any of the variations including the linear time trend by treatment or controlling for bike lanes. finally, we performed a number of other analyses that yielded similar results and are therefore not shown here. we ran a model with total daily unlinked bus trips as the dependent variable instead of the natural log and found almost the same fall in ridership, although some of these results were less significant. because difference-in-differences can be sensitive to functional form and because average daily route-level ridership in our treatment is larger than the control, we prefer the specification using the natural log of ridership. in other analyses, we changed the size of the catchment area around bus stops to a half mile or to a tenth of a mile and counted the number of bikesharing docks in this radius. the results were similar to our main specification using a quarter mile catchment area. 278 k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 6.2. results for alternative treatment based on fare type in the analysis using full fare ridership as the treatment group and reduced fare ridership as the control group, we also find a significant decrease in bus ridership. in column 1 of table 4, the results for manhattan and brooklyn show that every thousand bikesharing docks along the bus route is associated with a 0.0318 reduction in the natural log of full fare unlinked bus trips, or 3.13% of full fare trips, and this result is also significant at the 0.1 percent level. this is equivalent to a 4.2% reduction in full fare trips on a route with the mean number of docks. average daily full fare trips on treated routes in manhattan prior to bikeshare opening was 431,422, so this represents a fall in ridership of approximately 18,300 full fare trips per day. for manhattan only, shown in column 3, the results are smaller. in this case, there is a 2.04% fall in full fare trips per thousand docks along the route, which is equivalent to a 4.1% reduction in full fare trips on a route with the mean table 3 results

number of docks. using average daily full fare trips in manhattan of 236,330, this represents a fall in ridership of approximately 9,670 full fare trips per day. when we account for a linear time trend by treatment group (in columns 2 and 4), the estimated reduction in bus ridership remains significant and is larger. a placebo test (not shown) is not significant in any of these variations. 6.3. discussion of results through a number of specifications and tests, we find evidence that bikesharing reduced bus ridership in new york city. we included potential omitted variables such as changes to scheduled revenue miles of service and the introduction of select bus service, bus time, and boro taxis, tried a specification with a linear time trend by treatment, used alternate treatment measures, and performed a placebo test. because each of these supported our main findings, it is unlikely that the result is being driven by some general trend in the treatment group. also, limiting the sample to only bus routes that were within the bikesharing area and reproducing the result using an alternative control and treatment group by fare type demonstrates that it is unlikely that the results are being driven by something intrinsic only to the areas that received bikesharing. we discuss limitations of our findings in the following section. we presented the main specification side-by-side a specification controlling for bike lane infrastructure. methodologically it is difficult to separate the effect of opening the bikesharing system from other actions the city was taking at this time to support bicycling, such as expanding bike lanes as discussed in section 5.4. in terms of policy and planning applications, separating these effects may be less useful because in practice, municipal investment more broadly in bicycling often goes hand-in-hand with opening a bikesharing system. our main specification could potentially be interpreted as capturing this net effect; however, future research to disentangle these related factors is recommended. a final note is that, although we find that the immediate impact of bikesharing is a decline in daily bus ridership, this may not reflect the long-term impact. as pointed out by singleton and clifton (2015), even if transit and cycling are short-term substitutes, they could act as complements in the long-term. a transportation network based on a robust transit system and cycling network could impact future travel behavior, particularly long-term factors like the decision to own a car, which is not captured here. 7. areas for improvement and future research there are many areas for improvement and future research that have emerged from this study. first, a challenging aspect of this research design is controlling for all of the factors that could have affected route-level daily bus ridership during the table 4 alternate analysis with treatment based on fare type. manhattan & brooklyn

models. if such changes had an unequal effect in the treatment and control areas during the study period and if full fare passengers were more sensitive to these changes than reduced fare passengers, then their impact on bus ridership is not captured in our models and is an important area for improvement and future research. another factor that we do not specifically control for is the growth of new ridehailing services that were made available throughout new york city during the study period. because ridehailing data are not available prior to the opening of the bikesharing system, we cannot explicitly control for it in our models. however, if new ridehailing services impact bus ridership similarly within the control and treatment areas, then this has been accounted for in our main specification. if ridehailing has an uneven impact in these two areas of the city but has the same impact across full fare and reduced fare riders, then we would expect to find a large discrepancy between the main specification and the alternative treatment using fare type, which we do not. furthermore, if ridehailing has a different impact across the areas but follows a linear growth trend, then it could already be captured in the model that includes a time trend by treatment area. while we have utilized these strategies in an attempt to capture the impacts of ridehailing on bus ridership, we believe that this is an important area for future study, particularly in light of emerging ridehailing data availability. important areas for future research that have emerged from this work include studying other impacts that bikesharing systems could have on bus systems and on the transit system more broadly. first, reductions in bus ridership associated with the availability of bikesharing could have caused decreases in bus operating costs or revenue from bus passenger fares; this could have positive or negative implications for the transit agency and should be explored further. similarly, reductions in bus ridership during peak hours could result in decreased crowding on some of the most heavily trafficked bus routes in new york city, which could improve the quality of service from the passenger perspective. furthermore, as more travelers choose to bike using either bikesharing or personal bicycles, there could be impacts on the operations of vehicles on local roadways, including buses, due to the lower travel speeds of non-motorized modes. therefore, empirical investigation of the relationship between bus and bicycle speeds is recommended. each of these could have redistributive impacts and equity implications that have yet to be studied. future research should also quantify the impact of bikesharing on subway ridership in new york city. because the subway travels at different speeds and has larger distances between stops, it is unlikely to have the same relationship with bikesharing as the bus system. additionally, because new york city has a much denser bikesharing system and a more heavily used bus system, future research should also study the relationship between bus and bikeshare in small and medium sized cities. finally, the broader planning and public policy implications of this research should be considered. if both buses and bikes are considered shared transportation modes, questions of finance and subsidies will naturally be raised. in particular, our findings could suggest different arrangements for public-private partnership in which the impacts to municipal transit agencies are included. 8. policy implications and conclusion in this study, we quantified the effect that opening a bikesharing system has on bus ridership by exploiting a natural experiment afforded by the phased implementation of bikesharing in areas of new york city. the results indicate a significant decrease in bus ridership coincident with the implementation of the bikesharing system. our preferred model suggests that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42% reduction in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn. this represents a total daily fall in bus ridership of approximately 18,100. in the second model that additionally controls for bike lane infrastructure during this time, we find a smaller reduction due to bikesharing of 1.69%, or approximately 12,600 fewer daily bus trips. based on both model results, the overall ridership impacts were surprisingly large. considering that total average daily bikeshare trips are approximately 26,000 during the study period, our estimates of a decrease of 18,100 or 12,600 daily unlinked bus trips are sizable. if this effect is driven entirely by direct modal substitution of bikeshare members, then, even in the case where we separately control for bike lane infrastructure, it would mean that close to 50% of trips now made by bikeshare were previously made by bus. the model without bike lanes suggests that approximately 70% of bikeshare members may be substituting bikeshare for bus use. these percentages are higher than has been found in surveys of bikeshare members in other cities (shaheen et al., 2013). previous research suggests that the denser the bikesharing network and the denser the urban form, the more bikeshare members substitute biking for public transit (martin and shaheen, 2014). at the time of this writing, new york city’s bikesharing system is denser than the north american cities previously surveyed, so it is not surprising that it is in the higher end of estimates. however, this proportion of modal substitution is so large that we speculate that a considerable portion of the fall in bus ridership comes from an impact on non-members of bikeshare. it could be that people who are not bikeshare members have increased private cycling trips in lieu of bus trips. because our results indicate that the effect could be substantial, we recommend further study to investigate how bikesharing systems influence the travel behavior of non-members. finally, having a negative impact on bus ridership should not be a deterrent to implementing or expanding bikeshare schemes. in fact, the number of people who use bikesharing in new york city is a testament to its success at increasing urban mobility. instead, the knowledge of how these systems are interrelated is vital for planning a mutually reinforcing sustainable transport network. by quantifying the net effect of bikesharing, we hope our findings provide planners and k.b. campbell, c. brakewood / transportation research part a 100 (2017) 264–282 281 policymakers with more information on which to base future planning decisions to facilitate coordination of multimodal transportation. we hope that a better understanding of the relationship between these two different modes encourages agencies who traditionally operate separately to create more integrated systems that support the reality of multimodal, shared transportation systems. acknowledgments this research project was funded in part by a us dot eisenhower graduate fellowship. the authors are very grateful to the metropolitan transportation
