mokhtarian, 2002; ferrell, 2005; cao, 2009; clarke et al., 2015): (1) substitution – shopping trips are replaced by e-shopping; (2) complementarity – due to e-shopping, the frequency of shopping trips increases; (3) modification – owing to e-shopping, trips to physical stores are not replaced but are altered; and (4) neutrality – e-shopping has no effect on shopping travel. not surprisingly, previous empirical studies show conflicting results. some scholars assert that people reduce their shopping trips due to e-shopping, which indicates that e-shopping has a substitution effect on shopping trips (gould & golob, 1998;

weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2007, 2009; weltevreden & rotem-mindali, 2009; irawan & wirza, 2015). in contrast, other researchers argue that people frequently buying or searching online tend to make more shopping trips, suggesting a complementarity effect (farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; cao, 2012; cao et al., 2010, 2012; zhou & wang, 2014; zhen et al., 2016; ding & lu, 2017; lee et al., 2017; xi et al., 2018). in addition, some scholars also state that e-shopping alters the shopping travel pattern (e.g., duration, distance), which supports the modification effect (mokhtarian, 2002; ferrell, 2005; farag et al., 2006a, 2007). however, a few studies have shown that e-shopping does not have a significant effect on shopping travel, indicating a neutrality impact (sim & koi, 2002; calderwood & freathy, 2014). as the country with the largest online retail sales in the world, china is a well-suited study area to investigate the effect of eshopping on shopping travel. it is also reasonable to assume that some significant effects might be found. however, despite some studies analyzing e-shopping in china (zhen et al., 2016; ding & lu, 2017), the number of studies is rather low compared to other countries such as the netherlands (farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2007, 2009; maat & konings, 2018) and the united states (cao et al., 2010, 2012; zhou & wang, 2014; lee et al., 2017). in addition, the impact of eshopping on shopping travel among countries may differ considerably. for example, sim and koi (2002) attributed the neutral effect of e-shopping on shopping travel to singaporean’s preferences. in a scottish study, calderwood and freathy (2014) claimed that specific situational factors on islands can affect the relationship between e-shopping and shopping travel. it is acknowledged that as an emerging economy, china has a development context that is quite different from other (western) countries. therefore, it is vital to use evidence from china to clarify this rather controversial issue. in addition, congestion is a challenge faced by most cities in the world today (christidis & rivas, 2012; alam & ahmed, 2013; chang et al., 2017). especially in china, with highly rapid urbanization process, traffic congestion has become one of the biggest challenges for many cities. therefore, it is important to clarify whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips, which determines whether shopping online is a solution or a new challenge for urban congestion. as a result, focusing on this topic can have important implications for urban transportation systems (cao, 2012; crocco et al., 2013; zhen et al., 2016). in this context, it is the key objective of this paper to examine whether e-shopping replaces shopping trips with evidence from china. using data from structured interviews concerning e-shopping behavior in the chinese city of chengdu in 2016, we will attempt to answer the following questions: q1 – what are the determinants of e-shopping behavior? q2 – does e-shopping replace shopping trips? if yes, q3 – what are the determinants of whether people substitute e-shopping for shopping trips? the paper is organized as follows. in the next section, previous research is reviewed and discussed. section 3 presents the development context in china. section 4 contains the research design and methodology, while section 5 presents the main results. conclusions and a discussion are offered in the last section. 2. literature review 2.1. e-shopping versus shopping trips the topic of this study, i.e., the effect of e-shopping on shopping travel, has been analyzed for quite a while. before the widespread use of e-shopping, a related topic, the effect of telecommunication on transportation, has attracted scholarly attention since the 1960s (memmott, 1963; nilles et al., 1976; salomon, 1985, 1986; mokhtarian, 2002). at that time, the relationships between telecommunication and transportation were in early stages. for example, substitution, complementarity, and neutrality had been raised by theoretical frameworks. subsequently, borrowing from these relationships, some scholars attempted to build a conceptual framework to explain shopping behavior (salomon, 1985, 1986; mokhtarian, 2002). from this point on, this framework has been used widely in empirical research to explore the association between e-shopping and shopping travel (farag et al., 2006a, 2007; weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2007; clarke et al., 2015). to date, a significant body of literature has investigated the impacts of e-shopping on shopping travel. however, four types of effects are supported by substantial empirical evidence. (1) substitution. gould and golob (1998) were the first to analyze whether e-shopping will replace shopping trips using empirical evidence. they believed that although a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips exists, its effect is negligible in the united states. subsequently, also using data from the united states, research by ferrell (2005) indicated that respondents avoid 20% of a shopping trip for every 100 min they spend on e-shopping. evidence from the netherlands confirms this finding. for instance, weltevreden and rietbergen (2007, 2009) found that more than 20% of respondents agreed that they reduce the shopping trips to city center stores due to e-shopping. weltevreden (2007) further noted that in the long run, physical stores for some retail categories will be substituted by e-stores. weltevreden and rotem-mindali (2009) also showed that e-shopping leads to a net reduction in the amount of personal shopping trips. in addition, irawan and wirza (2015) similarly found in indonesia that e-shopping can decrease consumers’ willingness to conduct shopping trips. (2) complementarity. in a dutch study, farag et al. (2005, 2007) found that frequent online searchers are inclined to make more shopping trips than infrequent online searchers. farag et al. (2006a) further showed a complementary effect of e-shopping on shopping trips, since results indicated that people who purchase online tend to buy at physical stores more frequently. based on shopping survey data in the united states, cao et al. (2010) claimed that 49.3% of respondents were inclined to make a new trip to physical stores after seeing goods online, which indicated that the shopping trip was encouraged by e-shopping. cao et al. (2012) also found that the frequency of e-shopping has a positive effect on the frequency of shopping trips. cao (2012) further showed that the generation effect of e-shopping on shopping trips will impose extra burdens on existing transportation systems. similarly, zhou and wang (2014) and lee et al. (2017) also found a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 22 shopping trips. in addition to the studies mentioned above, a limited number of studies from china have been published in recent years. using data from nanjing, zhen et al. (2016) and xi et al. (2018) found a positive linkage between the frequency of buying or searching online and the frequency of shopping trips. applying a structural equation modeling approach to data from beijing, ding and lu (2017) claimed that e-shopping frequency has a positive association with the frequency of shopping trips to physical stores. (3) neutrality. mokhtarian (2002) noted that not every e-shopping activity will replace shopping trips; thus, its impact on shopping travel could be overlooked. using singapore as the study area, sim and koi (2002) stated that the effect of e-shopping on shopping travel is quite slim because singaporeans prefer to purchase at physical stores rather than e-stores. calderwood and freathy (2014) found that almost 80% of respondents indicated that the frequency of shopping trips was not affected by eshopping in the scottish isles. (4) modification. ferrell (2005) found that e-shoppers tend to take shorter-distance shopping trips in the united states. similarly, farag et al. (2006a, 2007) showed that the more frequently people buy online in the netherlands, the less time they spend on shopping trips to physical stores. from these previous studies, two main lessons can be learned. on the one hand, apart from a few cases, it is evident that eshopping has an effect on shopping travel. however, it remains rather uncertain whether this is due to substitution or complementarity effects. in this context, empirical evidence from an area with great e-shopping potential (e.g., china) can shed some new light on this issue. on the other hand, scholars largely ignored the shopping travel implications of china’s large e-retailing market before 2016. since then, only a few studies have begun to reveal this topic using evidence from china (e.g., zhen et al., 2016; ding & lu, 2017; xi et al., 2018). furthermore, some existing studies do not seem to be able to determine whether e-shopping generates shopping trips. some scholars found a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips and consequently claimed that there exists a complementary effect of e-shopping on shopping trips (e.g., farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; zhou & wang, 2014; zhen et al., 2016; ding & lu, 2017). however, evidence is limited because, for example, most e-shoppers are likely to decrease their frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping. frequent e-shoppers, however, still make more shopping trips than infrequent e-shoppers, as they have a higher shopping demand. in this case, the frequency of shopping trips is not encouraged by e-shopping, and a positive association does not indicate complementarity but indicates substitution. meanwhile, when respondents were asked whether they changed the frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping, they mostly indicated a reduction in frequency (e.g., weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2007; weltevreden & rotem-mindali, 2009; calderwood & freathy, 2014). compared to the former case, it is more reasonable to explore the issue in the latter case. three studies focusing on china indicate a complementary effect of e-shopping on the frequency of shopping trips because a positive association between e-shopping or online searching and shopping trip frequency was found (zhen et al., 2016; ding & lu, 2017, xi et al., 2018). however, their findings seem untenable. previous studies suggest that the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips to stores is associated with whether these stores will be eliminated (weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2009; cao et al., 2013). in other words, assuming that e-shopping stimulates consumers to make more shopping trips to physical stores, new physical stores might emerge. in this case, the demand for land by the retail industry is more likely to be extended to a certain extent. however, zhang et al. (2016) found that the demand for retail real estate is inhibited by e-commerce in china, which is irreconcilable with the findings of zhen et al. (2016), ding and lu (2017) and xi et al. (2018). 2.2. e-shopping determinants to date, many studies have investigated the factors affecting e-shopping behavior. sociodemographic factors have been tested frequently in previous studies. first, gender is found to affect e-shopping behavior, but conflicting results have been presented. in some studies, women are more likely to adopt e-shopping than men (ding & lu, 2017; maat & konings, 2018). however, some opposite findings have shown that men are more inclined to purchase online (farag et al., 2006b, 2007; crocco et al., 2013). in addition, zhen et al. (2016) stated that men are more likely to conduct e-shopping for electronics than women, but women are more likely to shop online for clothes and daily goods than men. lee et al. (2015), on the other hand, found that gender has no significant effect on e-shopping behavior. second, some researchers stated that age negatively influences e-shopping behavior (farag et al., 2007; crocco et al., 2013; zhou & wang, 2014; irawan & wirza, 2015; ding & lu, 2017; maat & konings, 2018). however, a nonlinear relationship between age and e-shopping behavior was found by farag et al. (2006b) and zhen et al. (2018). they found that up to the age of 33 years old, the probability of purchasing online rises with increasing age. after 33 years old, the probability of purchasing online starts to decline. third, a positive influence of income on e-shopping behavior was found by a considerable number of studies (farag et al., 2007; blasio, 2008; cao et al., 2012, 2013; crocco et al., 2013; zhou & wang, 2014; zhen et al., 2016, 2018). however, farag et al. (2006b) and ding and lu (2017) found an insignificant effect concerning income. irawan and wirza (2015) even stated that low-income groups tend to purchase online more frequently. fourth, it has been suggested that people with higher education levels are more inclined to engage in e-shopping (farag et al., 2006b, 2007; blasio, 2008; cao et al., 2012; zhou & wang, 2014; zhen et al., 2018), although ding and lu (2017) argued that education does not matter for e-shopping behavior. irawan and wirza (2015) even held a contrary opinion that people who are more educated are unlikely to purchase online. individual internet experiences have also been tested in previous studies. it has been indicated that the frequency of internet use positively affects e-shopping behavior (ding & lu, 2017; farag et al., 2006b, 2007; cao et al., 2013; maat & konings, 2018). furthermore, studies by farag et al. (2007) and ren and kwan (2009) showed that the number of years using the internet positively k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 23 affects e-shopping behavior. similarly, irawan and wirza (2015) stated that using the internet on a weekly base has a positive effect on e-shopping. with the widespread use of smartphones, e-shopping on smartphones has become common behavior. maat and konings (2018) stated that people who have a smartphone conduct e-shopping more frequently. car ownership is also expected to influence an individual’s e-shopping behavior. a study by irawan and wirza (2015) indicated that both the number of vehicles that households own and the number of family members having a driver’s license positively affect eshopping frequency in indonesia. similarly, zhen et al. (2016) found that people possessing a driver’s license are more inclined to purchase online for clothes, electronics, books, and daily goods in nanjing, china. in contrast, farag et al. (2006a) claimed that car ownership has an insignificant effect on the adoption of e-shopping in the united states. notably, ignoring car ownership, zhen et al. (2016) explored only the effect of driver’s license possession on e-shopping behavior in china. given the conflicting results in previous studies, it remains unclear how car ownership influences e-shopping behavior in china. geographers have paid much attention to the effect of location factors on e-shopping behavior. at the beginning of the 2000s, two plausible hypotheses were proposed (anderson et al., 2003; boschma and weltevreden, 2004; farag et al., 2006b). one is the innovation diffusion hypothesis, stating that urban residents are most likely to adopt e-shopping, as they are better educated and more likely to actively use the internet for other purposes. the other is the efficiency hypothesis, which postulates that people in nonmetropolitan or suburban areas are more likely to adopt e-shopping, since they can benefit more from online shopping as a consequence of lower accessibility to stores. the two hypotheses have subsequently been tested by empirical evidence. farag et al. (2005, 2007) stated that people living in more urbanized areas are inclined to purchase online, which tends to support the innovation diffusion hypothesis. similarly, cao et al. (2013) and zhou and wang (2014) found that people living in urban areas engage in more frequent e-shopping. on the other hand, krizek et al. (2005) showed that – in metropolitan areas – people living in the suburbs or further from the city center purchase more frequently online, which seems to confirm the efficiency hypothesis. given that shopping trips are usually chained with trips for other purposes, especially commuting trips (salomon, 1986; ferrell, 2005; rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013), the effect of work location on e-shopping has also been tested (zhen et al., 2018). the results indicate that people living and working in urban areas are more likely to purchase books online. surprisingly, mchugh (2014) found that location factors have no significant effect on e-shopping behavior. except for the above factors examined most frequently in previous studies, other factors are also expected to determine eshopping behavior. for example, some studies have shown that the type of work can play a key role in e-shopping behavior (ren & kwan, 2009; cao et al., 2013; irawan & wirza, 2015). the effect of attitudes towards e-shopping or in-store shopping on e-shopping behavior has also been discussed in other studies (cao et al., 2010, 2013; zhou & wang, 2014; irawan & wirza, 2015). although a significant body of research has explored e-shopping determinants, very few studies have investigated the determinants of whether people increase or decrease shopping trip frequency due to e-shopping. weltevreden & rietbergen (2009) examined this question and determined some interesting findings: (1) for nondaily goods, people who frequently purchase online, have low accessibility to shops by car, enjoy in-store shopping to a limited degree, or are relatively young are more likely to substitute eshopping for shopping trips. however, gender and education do not seem to play a significant role. (2) for specialty goods, people who purchase online frequently, search online frequently, have low accessibility to shops by car, have less enjoyment for in-store shopping, or are male tend to substitute e-shopping for shopping trips. age has a nonlinear effect on the probability of making fewer shopping trips. overall, there have been conflicting results concerning e-shopping determinants. for example, gender, age, and location seem to play different roles in e-shopping among existing studies. it is reasonable to assume that we can attribute these conflicting outcomes not only to research limitations (e.g., methodology, definition of e-shopping, quality of data) but also to local contexts of study areas (e.g., economic development, urbanization, informatization, social culture). hence, the determinants of e-shopping should be explored in various regions. 3. development contexts in china as an emerging economy, china has a special context that is different from other (western) countries. considering that local contexts have a profound effect on e-shopping behavior (e.g., sim & koi, 2002; calderwood & freathy, 2014), it is necessary to present the development contexts in china, which may contribute to the understanding of the following analysis results. in recent years, china has enjoyed a rapid urbanization. data from the national bureau of statistics of china (2016a) indicated that the urbanization rate (percentage of people living in urban areas) in china increased to 56% in 2015 from 38% in 2001. it was reported by the chengdu municipal commission of economy and information technology (2017) that the total population reached 15.9 million with an urbanization rate of 70.6% in 2016 in chengdu. consequently, the considerable transport congestion is mainly caused by rapid urbanization and a very high population density in chengdu and other chinese large cities. additionally, compared to most western countries, china has a relatively low rate of car ownership (zhen et al., 2016, 2018). therefore, it may not be convenient for many urban residents in china to make shopping trips by private cars. in this context, the residents’ desire for shopping trips may be reduced because e-shopping has become a viable alternative. in addition, with the booming growth of the e-retailing market, the demand for delivery service has increased dramatically. it was reported by the state post bureau of china (2016) that the number of fast deliveries, which are mainly used for e-shopping, reached 20.67 billion in 2015, representing a 48% increase from 2014. furthermore, the revenue from fast deliveries was 276.96 billion yuan (≈us $ 43.90 billion) in 2015, representing a 35% increase from 2014. consequently, delivery companies have emerged rapidly in china. in recent years, some have become listed companies, such as shunfeng co. ltd., yuantong co. ltd., and shentong co. ltd. thus, unlike most western countries, delivery service stations are distributed densely from cities to villages in china, partially k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 24 because these companies offer fast delivery services at a relatively low price. usually, consumers living in large cities can receive goods on the day or the day after they order online. consumers living in other areas can always receive goods within seven days. thus, high-quality delivery services may attract people to adopt e-shopping, which is one of the main reasons why the largest online retail development has occurred in china. china also has particular experience in terms of retail development. before e-shopping emerged, purchasing by telephone or mail was popular in most western countries. hence, some scholars postulated that people might substitute e-shopping for buying by telephone or mail but not for shopping trips (salomon, 1985; keskinen et al., 2001; mokhtarian, 2004; rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013). however, unlike western countries, telephone and internet were not used frequently in china before the 1990s. consequently, the retail marketing by telephone and mail was not fully mature before e-shopping emerged. therefore, in china, it seems that people might substitute e-shopping for shopping trips but not for buying by telephone or mail. 4. methodology 4.1. data collection 4.1.1. study area and dataset data from this research is drawn from structured interviews conducted in july and august 2016 in chengdu, china. chengdu, the capital of sichuan province, is located in southwest china (see fig. 1). in 2016, chengdu was listed as one of eight national central cities by the national development and reform commission of china (2016). the national bureau of statistics of china (2016b) reported that in chengdu, the number of internet service subscribers was 4.74 million households in 2015 and total retail sales of consumer goods reached ¥ 494.62 billion (≈us $ 78.03 billion). apparently, chengdu has enjoyed rapid urbanization and informatization and has had a significant body of demand for retail, suggesting an enormous potential for e-shopping. thus, it is reasonable to assume that chengdu is a good and representative case city for this study. a cluster sampling approach was used to select neighborhoods and respondents in five steps. first, we defined the target population as people who have used e-shopping at least once in their life, i.e., e-shoppers (partly because people who had never purchased online in chengdu turned out very hard to find when conducting a preliminary survey). second, we determined the desired sample size (approximately 600–1000 respondents) which would make it possible to conduct regression analyses with ample confidence. third, the sampled area was defined as the built-up area within the third ring road of chengdu (see fig. 1), where most of chengdu’s residents live. fourth, the number of the sampled neighborhoods was determined (10 sampled neighborhoods). fifth, among the public spaces (which were open and accessible for every resident), we geographically randomly selected 10 sampled neighborhoods (within the sampled area), in which the structured interviews were performed: chunxilu shopping center, jinniu- wanda shopping center, laifushi shopping center, hongpailou shopping center, kaide shopping center, tianfu square, shahe park, huanhuaxi park, tazishan park, and dongjiaojiyi music park (see fig. 1). to minimize selection bias, we made some efforts. on the one hand, our interviews were conducted after people finished work on weekdays and during the entire day on weekends. on the other hand, a set of postcards marked with the lanzhou university logo was provided as an incentive after the respondent finished the survey. in the end, 1796 people were approached to participate in the survey, and 882 accepted our invitation. the response rate was 49.1%. the group of people who did not participate in this survey were those who indicated being in a rush or not being interested or people who had never adopted e-shopping. after removal of some questionnaires missing key responses, 710 valid samples were collected. as shown in table 1, 51.1% of the respondents are men, and 58.5% of them are younger than 26. according to a report by the china electronic commerce research center (2016), 47.4% of e-shoppers in china are men, and 51.2% of them are younger than 27. based on this rudimentary comparison (due to a lack of additional information on chinese e-shoppers), our respondents seem rather representative of china’s e-shoppers. however, conducting the survey in public spaces might result in a certain level of selection bias. first, at these locations (but also at other places in china), older people are less inclined to participate in surveys. however, because these people often do not purchase goods online, this was not a major problem for this study. consequently, our respondents are relatively young (but not considerably younger than the total population of chinese e-shoppers). second, people who lived in the sampled area but do not regularly visit these public spaces were ignored. the dataset consists of five categories of information. the first category includes individual sociodemographic information, such as age, gender, and educational background. the second category is information about internet experience and car ownership. the third category is the departure place from which the respondent mostly makes a shopping trip. the fourth category is the frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips to physical stores. considering that the frequency of e-shopping might vary among types of goods (weltevreden, 2007; zhen et al., 2016, 2018), we selected four types of goods that are purchased online most frequently in china: clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics. the respondents were asked to provide the monthly frequency of eshopping for four types of goods (see table 2) and to provide the monthly frequency of shopping trips to physical stores for these goods (both for a “regular month”). based on the methodologies of previous studies (weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2007; weltevreden & rotem-mindali, 2009; calderwood & freathy, 2014), the fifth category is change in the frequency of shopping trips and total shopping1 owing to e-shopping. the respondents were asked to answer two questions: after adopting e-shopping for the four types of goods, (1) do you change your frequency of shopping trips to physical stores? (2) do you change your frequency of 1 in this study, we define total shopping as the sum of e-shopping and in-store shopping, which roughly reflects respondents’ shopping demand. k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 25 table 1 comparison of basic characteristics between samples and target population. sample china e-commerce research center (2016) description n % description % gender male 363 51.1 male 47.4 female 347 48.9 female 52.6 age (years) 25 or less 415 58.5 26 or less 51.2 26 or more 295 41.5 27 or more 48.8 fig. 1. location of chengdu. k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 26 total shopping? the alternative answers to the two questions were set on a 5-point scale: decreased substantially, decreased somewhat, no change, increased somewhat, and increased substantially. 4.1.2. dependent variable in this study, we used two dependent variable categories: (1) the frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips for four types of goods are extracted as the data source of the dependent variable. first, we sum the frequency of e-shopping for four types of goods, representing the frequency of e-shopping (see table 1). second, the frequency of shopping trips to physical stores for these goods is used to reflect the frequency of shopping trips. third, as performed by maat and konings (2018), we calculate the share of e-shopping frequency in total shopping frequency to indicate the probability that the respondents adopt e-shopping when having a shopping demand. (2) as mentioned earlier, the determinants of whether to decrease or increase the frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping have not been explored properly before. this study will attempt to fill this research gap. to do so, we analyze whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips as a dependent variable. 4.1.3. explanatory variable based on the literature review above, we identify several explanatory variable categories (sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership, and spatial attributes) as reported in table 3. given a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trip frequency, weltevreden and rietbergen (2007, 2009) found that people frequently purchasing online have a higher probability of reducing their shopping trips. since it is currently unclear whether this effect can also be found in china, the frequency of e-shopping is added as the explanatory variable of whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips. additionally, home location is expected to be an explanatory variable of e-shopping behavior in previous studies, since it determines the accessibility to physical stores (farag et al., 2005, 2007; cao et al., 2013; zhou & wang, 2014). however, some scholars have argued that the residential location may not indicate accessibility because shopping trips are usually chained with other trips, especially commuting trips (salomon, 1986; ferrell, 2005; rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013). in other words, assuming that someone lives in a weakly urbanized area but works in a strongly urbanized area, he/she usually departs for a shopping trip from a work location. in this case, he/she has a high accessibility to physical stores even though he/she lives in a weakly urbanized area. therefore, the accessibility to physical stores is not determined by residential location but by the departure location for a shopping trip. using the residential location as the explanatory variable has its shortcomings. although zhen et al. (2018) made an effort to consider both home location and work location as the spatial variable, it is still not the best solution to make up for this shortcoming. hence, we regard the departure location where the respondent mostly makes a shopping trip as the independent variable representing the location factor. chengdu is a city with a high urbanization level that continuously decreases from city center to city periphery. in this context, we define the area within the third ring road as the urban area, the area between the third ring road and the fourth ring road as the suburban area, and the area outside the fourth ring road as the exurban area (see fig. 1). table 2 frequency of e-shopping for four types of goods in a regular month. frequency (times/month) clothes, shoes electronics food, drink cosmetics total mean 2.79 1.23 3.10 1.38 8.50 s.d. 2.69 2.21 3.79 2.12 8.29 variance 7.25 4.90 14.36 4.47 68.76 table 3 definitions and descriptive statistics of dummy/ordinal explanatory variables. variables definitions mean/percentage s.d. gender 1=male, 0=female 51.1% – age (years) 1=20 or less, 2=21–25, 3=26–30, 4=more than 30 2.34 1.05 education 1=high school or less, 2=colleges/ technical school, 3=undergraduate school, 4=graduate school or more 2.51 0.91 income (¥/month) 1=1000 or less, 2=1001–4000, 3=4001–8000, 4=more than 8000 2.21 0.97 cost of living (¥/month) 1=1000 or less, 2=1001–2000, 3=2001–4000, 4=more than 4000 2.44 0.90 years of using smartphones 1=3 or less, 2=4–5, 3=more than 5 2.23 0.68 years of using internet on pcs 1=5 or less, 2=6–9, 3=more than 9 2.26 0.69 car(s) ownership 1=yes, 0=no 61.3% – departure location urban area 1=yes, 0=no 48.7% – suburban area 1=yes, 0=no 37.9% – exurban area 1=yes, 0=no 13.4% – k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 27 4.2. modeling approach in this study, we develop three types of regression models. first, given that the frequency of e-shopping and the frequency of shopping trips are two sets of count variables, both poisson and negative binomial regression models can be adopted. however, the means of two sets of count variables are both smaller than their variances,2 which does not support the requirement of the poisson regression model that the mean of the dependent variable is roughly equal to its variance. negative binomial regression models are therefore employed to investigate the determinants of e-shopping and shopping trip frequency. second, considering that the share of e-shopping is a continuous variable and largely follows a normal distribution,3 we develop a linear regression model to identify the determinants of the share of e-shopping. third, we further develop a binomial logistic regression model to search for the determinants of whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips, which is a set of binary variables. 5. results 5.1. determinants of e-shopping frequency, shopping trip frequency, and share of e-shopping as reported in tables 4 and 5, sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership and spatial attributes are found to significantly affect e-shopping frequency, shopping trip frequency, and share of e-shopping. the results indicate that women are more likely to purchase online frequently, which is consistent with the findings of several previous studies (e.g., ding & lu, 2017; maat & konings, 2018). additionally, women also make more shopping trips and have a higher share of e-shopping. this finding is in line with the chinese study of ding and lu (2017), suggesting that women are, compared to men, more likely to purchase both online and in-store. zhen et al. (2016) found that shopping responsibility is largely determined by gender. in china, women usually bear more shopping responsibility for families than men, probably resulting in a higher shopping demand. we found that older respondents are also more likely to purchase online frequently. this result seems to contradict with many previous studies (farag et al., 2007; zhou & wang, 2014; irawan & wirza, 2015; ding & lu, 2017; maat & konings, 2018). however, this result is not that surprising, since our respondents are relatively young. to a large extent, our findings are consistent with the findings of farag et al. (2006b) and zhen et al. (2018), claiming that for respondents younger than 34, age has a positive effect on eshopping frequency. similarly, older people tend to make more shopping trips probably because shopping responsibilities for families grow with increasing age. people with higher education are more likely to purchase online frequently, which supports many previous studies (farag et al., 2006b, 2007; blasio, 2008; cao et al., 2012; zhou & wang, 2014; zhen et al., 2018). additionally, people with a higher educational background are also inclined to make more shopping trips, which is consistent with the finding of farag et al. (2005). income is negatively associated with the frequency of both e-shopping and shopping trips, possibly because people with higher incomes have more time pressure and a higher value of time, resulting in a lower demand for both e-shopping and in-store shopping. although quite a number of researchers found that higher-income respondents are more likely to purchase online frequently (e.g., farag et al., 2007; blasio, 2008; cao et al., 2012, 2013, zhou & wang, 2014; zhen et al., 2016, 2018), it seems that respondents with lower incomes can benefit more from purchasing online. it is an important asset for e-retailers that, using the same amount of money as before, consumers can purchase more goods online since the goods are provided at a lower price by e-retailers (rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013). hence, purchasing online is a good strategy for consumers to save money, resulting in high levels of e-shopping for people who have low income levels. in addition, people who have a higher income may pay more attention to the quality of goods than price. thus, they are less likely to purchase online, as the quality of online goods is relatively low in china (ding & lu, 2017). we also found that people with a high cost of living are more likely to conduct both e-shopping and shopping trips frequently, which can be largely explained by their higher shopping demand. however, our results show that people with considerable experience using internet on pcs have a lower interest in e-shopping, which is inconsistent with most existing research (farag et al., 2006b, 2007; farag et al., 2007; ren & kwan, 2009; cao et al., 2013; irawan & wirza, 2015; ding & lu, 2017; maat & konings, 2018). this finding may be attributed to the new context of the information era in china. it has been reported that 55.5% of chinese e-retailing sales in 2015 were conducted by mobile terminals, such as smartphones and ipads (iresearch, 2017b). the possible reasons why people transfer e-shopping partially to mobile devices instead of a personal computer (pc) in china are as follows. on the one hand, compared to pcs, mobile devices have unique advantages, such as ubiquity, convenience, localization, and personalization (groß, 2015). on the other hand, some apps installed on mobile terminals for payment are very popular in china, such as alipay, wechat payment. therefore, with the widespread use of smartphones, the use of pcs is no longer necessary for e-shopping and can even be regarded as burdensome. moreover, people who have a long history of using pcs may have developed risk awareness. some studies have indicated that risk aversion has a negative effect on e-shopping (park and kim, 2003; al-debei et al., 2015). thus, they may tend to partake in less e-shopping. although ding and lu (2017) found that the duration of internet use has a significant positive effect on online shopping in china, the data in their study were collected in 2012, when only 5.8% of e-retailing sales were conducted by mobile devices (iresearch, 2017b). 2 the means of e-shopping and shopping trip frequency are 8.50 and 7.40, and the variances are 68.76 and 43.17, respectively. 3 the skewness and kurtosis of e-shopping shares are 0.60 and 0.15, respectively (smaller than 1), indicating that the set of variables largely follows the normal distribution. k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 28 moreover, people owning a car tend to conduct fewer shopping trips, which is in line with the finding of farag et al. (2007), possibly because they can transport more goods by car at a time. on the other hand, traffic congestion at shopping centers may also inhibit them from driving a car to go shopping. in addition, location plays a key role in e-shopping behavior. the results indicate that people who mostly start their shopping trips from urban areas are more likely to purchase online frequently. furthermore, people who mostly start their shopping trips from urban areas or exurban areas are inclined to have a higher e-shopping share compared to respondents departing from suburban areas. since the individual factors (e.g., age, education, income, internet experience) are controlled for in the model, the built environment seems to have a significant effect on e-shopping share. for people departing from urban areas, higher accessibility to physical stores might result in a higher interest in e-shopping. for example, it is more convenient for them to visit a physical store to ensure the quality of goods before shopping online, which could stimulate them to conduct more e-shopping because of lower prices of online goods table 4 negative binomial models concerning the frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips. independent variables e-shopping shopping trips b s.e. b s.e. gender (male) −0.16*** 0.06 −0.10* 0.06 age (years) 0.17*** 0.04 0.17*** 0.04 education 0.12*** 0.04 0.05* 0.03 income (¥/month) −0.22*** 0.05 −0.21*** 0.05 cost of living (¥/month) 0.22*** 0.04 0.17*** 0.04 years of using smartphones 0.00 0.05 years of using internet on pcs −0.26*** 0.05 car ownership (yes) −0.09 0.06 −0.12** 0.06 departure location urban area 0.25*** 0.06 0.08 0.06 exurban area 0.02 0.10 −0.13 0.09 suburban area 0.00 0.00 constant 1.93*** 0.15 1.60*** 0.12 alpha 0.49 0.03 0.41 0.03 log-likelihood −2179.88 −2078.25 n 710 710 note: given that internet experience has no potential direct effect on the frequency of shopping trips, independent variables associated with use of internet are removed in the regression model for shopping trips. * p < 0.1. ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.01. table 5 linear regression model concerning the share of e-shopping. independent variables share of e-shopping b s.e. gender (male) −0.03** 0.01 age (years) 0.01 0.01 education 0.01 0.01 income (¥/month) −0.01 0.01 cost of living (¥/month) 0.01 0.01 years of using smartphones −0.01 0.01 years of using internet on pcs −0.04*** 0.01 car ownership (yes) 0.02 0.01 departure location urban area 0.04*** 0.01 exurban area 0.04** 0.02 suburban area 0.00 constant 0.54*** 0.03 r2 0.04 adjusted r2 0.03 durbin-watson 1.87 f 3.22 sig. 0.00 n 710 *p < 0.1. ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.01. k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 29 (rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013). this result seems consistent with the innovation diffusion hypothesis (anderson et al., 2003) and roughly confirms the findings of some studies on e-shopping (farag et al., 2007; cao et al., 2013; zhou & wang, 2014). for people departing from exurban areas, it is more convenient to conduct e-shopping compared to shopping trips because of lower accessibility to physical stores. this result is in line with the findings of ren and kwan (2009) and provides empirical evidence to loosely support the efficiency hypothesis. however, compared to urban areas, people who mostly start a shopping trip from suburban areas find it less convenient to visit a physical store before e-shopping. respondents starting their trips from suburban areas also benefit less from online shopping because of higher accessibility to physical stores compared to exurban areas. both explanations might partly explain the finding that people departing in suburban areas are less likely to conduct e-shopping. interestingly, some factors play similar roles in both e-shopping and shopping trip frequency. for instance, women, or people who are older, better educated, with a lower income, or with a higher cost of living tend to conduct both e-shopping and shopping trips frequently. this finding is probably attributed to their higher shopping demand. 5.2. the effect of e-shopping on shopping trip frequency in this section, we aim to explore the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips by analyzing change in the frequency of shopping trips owing to e-shopping. as shown in table 6, more than 44% of the respondents indicate that they make fewer shopping trips due to eshopping, although 14.9% of the respondents say that they increase shopping trip frequency. as a result, it can be suggested that in most cases, e-shopping has a substitution effect on shopping trips, which is consistent with some previous studies (ferrell, 2005; weltevreden & rietbergen, 2007, 2009; weltevreden, 2007; weltevreden & rotem-mindali, 2009; irawan & wirza, 2015). we can attribute this finding to china’s emerging contexts mentioned above: urban traffic congestion, relatively low rate of car ownership, and developed e-retailing and (fast) delivery service. 5.3. the effect of e-shopping on total shopping frequency interestingly, we also find that more than 70% of the respondents indicate that e-shopping makes them increase the frequency of total shopping, i.e., conventional shopping and e-shopping combined (see table 7). that is, e-shopping has a promotion effect on the shopping demand. three reasons may lead to this result. first, it is widely acknowledged that saving time is one of the most important motivations for e-shopping (farag et al., 2006a, 2007). hence, the time saved by e-shopping may be exploited by consumers to conduct more shopping. second, compared to conventional channels, e-commerce provides more convenience to consumers to acquire goods information, which may seduce consumers to have more desire for shopping (weltevreden & rietbergen, 2004; cao, 2012). third, the goods are usually sold with a lower price on the e-retail website. thus, using the same amount of money as before, the consumer can buy more goods online (rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013). it should be noted that, the finding that e-shopping partially replaces shopping trips but also generates more shopping in total is not necessarily conflicting. 5.4. determinants of whether e-shopping replaces shopping trips given a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips, we aim to explore the determinants of whether respondents substitute e-shopping for shopping trips by using a binomial logistic regression model in this section. as shown in table 8, people who do not own a private car tend to reduce their shopping trips. usually, they use public transport for shopping trips and thus must spend more table 6 change in the frequency of shopping trips after the introduction of e-shopping. changes n % decreased substantially 39 5.49 decreased somewhat 276 38.87 no change 289 40.70 increased somewhat 85 11.97 increased substantially 21 2.96 total 710 100.00 table 7 change in the frequency of total shopping after the introduction of e-shopping. changes n % decreased substantially 3 0.42 decreased somewhat 14 1.97 no change 184 25.92 increased somewhat 408 57.46 increased substantially 101 14.23 total 710 100.00 k. shi, et al. transportation research part a 122 (2019) 21–33 30 time on a shopping trip than those who drive to shops. hence, compared to in-store shopping, purchasing online becomes a better way for them to save time, resulting in the substitution of shopping trips. the outcome also indicates that, due to e-shopping, people who purchase online frequently are less likely to reduce shopping trip frequency. although this result is inconsistent with the finding of weltevreden and rietbergen (2007, 2009), it could be explained as follows. as observed before, people who purchase online more frequently seem to have a higher shopping demand, which may make them have less likelihood to reduce their shopping trips. in addition, no significant associations between other factors (e.g., sociodemographics, internet experience, or spatial attributes) and substitution of e-shopping for shopping trips are found. 6. conclusion and discussion using data from 710 structured interviews in 2016 in chengdu, china, we aim to examine whether e-shopping for four types of goods (clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics) replaces shopping trips. this paper made the following contributions. first, we investigated the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips with evidence from china, where the largest amount of eretailing in the world takes place, as china was largely ignored by previous studies. second, we identified the determinants of whether people substitute e-shopping for shopping trips, which is an important gap in previous studies. third, we redefined the “location” as where people mostly start their shopping trips, which is different from that in previous studies. the new definition of table 8 binomial logistic regression model concerning whether to reduce shopping trips owing to e-shopping. independent variables reduction in shopping trip frequency (yes=1;

(2016) also found that the extension of urban commercial land is inhibited by ecommerce. although the continuous growth of shopping demands in china may offset the negative effect of e-shopping on physical stores, a loss of revenue for conventional stores still exists owing to such a large size and dramatic-rapid growth rate of e-shopping market in china. our results have two implications for transportation systems. on the one hand, e-shopping might be a possible solution for urban congestion because a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips is found. on the other hand, people who do not have a private car normally make a shopping trip to stores on foot or by public transportation. meanwhile, our results indicate that, compared to people who own a private car, those who do not own a private car are more likely to substitute e-shopping for shopping trips. hence, it could be concluded that e-shopping can reduce the travel demand for public transportation to a certain extent. however, some important issues should be considered when the effect of e-shopping on the transportation system is discussed. first, some researchers claim that, for some intangible goods (e.g., hairdressing), e-shopping can hardly replace the personal trips because the consumer has to travel to collect or consume them (clark & unwin, 1981; cohen-blankshtain and rotem-mindali, 2016). in this study, we only focus on these tangible goods (e.g., clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics), which are transportable. it remains unclear whether e-shopping for intangible goods has the same effect on shopping trips (in china). second, although the substitution effect of e-shopping indicates that e-shopping can help consumers attain the strategy of saving time, it is not certain whether the time saved by e-shopping is used to make other trips (gould & golob, 1997; rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013). third, the more frequently people buy online, the higher demand for delivery service they will have. it is also possible that delivery services cause additional urban congestion (weltevreden & rotem-mindali, 2009; crocco et al., 2013; rotem-mindali & weltevreden, 2013), which we did not analyze in this study. finally, the frequency of shopping trips is not the only factor affecting urban traffic because the distance and duration of shopping trips also play important roles. in other words, it is possible that eshoppers substitute e-shopping for shopping trips but extend the distance and duration of shopping trips at the same time. in this case, the net effect of e-shopping on urban congestion might be negligible or even positive. the above-mentioned points could be regarded as the future research directions. in addition, the selection bias resulting from respondents being recruited in certain public spaces in chengdu limits the generalizability of our findings. future studies might therefore approach respondents in varied types of spaces within chengdu, but also in other chinese cities. furthermore, other factors, such as individual work types, attitudes towards e-shopping and in-store shopping, should be considered as potential determinants of e-shopping behavior in future research. acknowledgements the authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments and suggestions. this work also
