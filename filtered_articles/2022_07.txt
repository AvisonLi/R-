(2) accumulative order. the traditional gm model is built on the basis of the first-order cumulative generation operation (1-ago), which aims to reduce the randomness of time series to achieve the purpose of accurate prediction. however, some scholars have found that the predictive accuracy of the gm model based on the 1-ago is even lower than that of thegmmodel based on initial sequence modeling in some cases [12]. to solve this problem, wu proposed the idea of the fractional-order accumulative generation operation (r-ago) [13]. the idea of r-ago is to establish a programming problem based on the model, and then use the intelligent optimization algorithms to solve the programming problem to obtain the accumulation order r that make themodel have theminimum error. if the benefit brought by the accumulative operation is too small, the order of the r-agois 0, that is, the original time series is used formodeling. if the accumulative operation can greatly enhance the predictive accuracy of the predictive model, then the algorithms can find the best order to build the model. since r-ago can stably improve the performance of forecasting models, many grey system models based on r-ago have been developed [14,15]. in addition, inspired bywu [13], many other fractionalorder accumulation operations have come into being. for instance, inspired by the conformable fractional derivative, ma et al. proposed the conformable fractional grey prediction model [16]. subsequently, chen et al. put forward the grey forecastingmodel with the fractional-order hausdorff accumulation operation and proved the superiority of the proposed model by cases [17]. based on wu’s research [13], liu et al. proposed the weighted r-ago [18] and so on. (3) parameter estimation. similar to other regression prediction models, gm models usually utilize the least square method (lsm) to estimate the structural parameters of the models. indeed, the lsm is a good method because it is easy to understand, but it is antiquated and limits the predictive performance of the models to some extent. to further optimize the gm models, some scholars proposed to use other parameter estimation methods to estimate the structural parameters of the models. these methods include partial least square (pls) [19], nonlinear least square (nls) [20,21], and the weighted least square method (wls) [22,23]. among these methods, the weighted least square method has the simplest mechanism and powerful performance. with the above discussion, we knowthat thegm(1,1,tα) is an ideal model, the r-ago and the wls are measures that can stably enhance the performance of the gmmodels. to accurately predict china’s aging population, this paper establishes an optimized gm(1,1,tα) model based on the gm(1,1,tα) model, r-ago and wls. compared with previous studies, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we use the midpoint formula to solve the problem that gm(1,1,tα) model is difficult to be solved. 123 complex & intelligent systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 3465 (2) we propose a new combined fractional-order accumulation operator. (3) we use the weighted least square method with strong compatibility to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. (4) this paper uses the proposed model to predict china’s aging population in the next 4 years, and gives corresponding suggestions based on the prediction results. the other parts of this article are arranged as follows: the next section gives the necessary knowledge including the definition of the gm(1,1, tα) model and combined r-ago. the third section discusses the concepts, properties and solution methods of the proposed model.the fourth section proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model through five real cases. the fifth section describes the application of the proposed model in china’s aging population. the conclusion is given in the last section. prerequisite knowledge traditional gm(1,1,t˛)model and its optimized discrete form supposing there is a time sequence x(0) = {x(0) (m) ,m = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, n ≥ 4, then x(1) = ⎧⎨ ⎩ x(1) (m) = m  j=1 x(0) ( j ),m = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n ⎫⎬ ⎭ (1) is called the first-order accumulative generation operation (1-ago) sequence of x(0). based on the above conditions, the grey equation of the gm(1,1,tα) model is expressed as [x(1) (t)] t + ax(1) (t) = b · tα + c. (2) usually, the predictive formula of gm models is the solution of the grey differential equation. obviously there is no exact solution for eq. (1). when qian et al. put forward the model, they did not provide a solving method for the model, but only used α = 2 to establish the model for prediction, which greatly restricted the predictive ability of the gm(1,1,tα) model. in the past, people usually used the forward difference formula [22] or the backward difference formula [24] to approximate the derivative to discretize the differential equation similar to eq. (1). however, these two methods are not the best methods. according to the difference quotient method shown in fig. 2, we can see that the accuracy of the midpoint formula is much higher than that of the forward difference formula and the backward difference formula. next, we estimate the errors of the three difference quotient formulas. performing taylor expansion of f (a+h) at point a to get f (a + h) = f (a) + h f  (a) + h2 2 f  (ζ ), ζ ∈ [a, a + h]. (3) substituting the above equation into the forward difference formula f  (a) = f (a+h)− f (a) h + ε, we can get f  (a) = f (a) + h f  (a) + h2 2 f  (ζ ) − f (a) h + ε = f  (a) + h 2 f  (ζ ) + ε, (4) that is ε = −h 2 f  (ζ ). (5) therefore, the truncation error of the forward difference formula is o(h). similarly, we can know that the truncation errors of the backward difference formula and the midpoint formula are o(h) and o(h2). obviously, the midpoint formula has the least error. therefore, we use the midpoint formula to discretize eq. (2), and then we can get x(1) (t + 1) − x(1) (t − 1) = −2ax(1) (t) + 2btα + 2c. (6) let μ1 = −2a,μ2 = 2b,μ3 = 2c, and then eq. (6) can be expressed by x(1) (t + 1) = x(1) (t − 1) + μ1x(1) (t) + μ2tα + μ3. (7) equation (7) is called the optimized discrete gm(1,1,tα) model (odgm(1,1,tα)model). similar to the regression prediction model, the parameters μ1,μ2,μ3 of the odgm(1,1, tα) model are estimated by using the lsm, that is, δ = ( μ 1, μ 2, μ 3) = (bt b) −1bt y , (8) where y = ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝ x(1) (3) − x(1) (1) x(1) (4) − x(1) (2) ... x(1) (n) − x(1) (n − 2) ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠ , b = ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝ x(1) (2) 2α 1 x(1) (3) 3α 1 ... ... ... x(1) (n − 1) (n − 1)α 1 ⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠ . once the estimated parameters  μ1, μ 2, μ 3 of the odgm(1,1,tα) are obtained by the least square method 123 3466 complex & intelligent systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 fig. 2 schematic diagram of the difference quotient method (lsm), the time response function the model can be expressed as x (1) (t + 1) = x (1) (t − 1) +  μ1x(1) (t) +  μ2tα +  μ3c. (9) since the odgm(1,1, tα) model is built using the 1-ago, it is necessary to carry out the 1-order inverse ago (1-iago) on eq. (9) to obtain the predicted values, that is, x (0) (t) = x (1) (t) − x (1) (t − 1) , t = 2, 3, · · · . (10) according to the introduction of the odgm(1,1,tα) model, we can still find some deficiencies. (1) the odgm(1,1,tα) model is built based on the 1-ago. although a sequence with weakened randomness can be obtained by 1-ago, this does not mean that the prediction performance of the model is improved. (2) similar to the traditional regression model, the odgm(1, 1,tα) model uses the lsm to solve the structural parameters of the model. indeed, the lsm is a good method, but it is too simple and limits the predictive performance of the model to some extent. these two points provide ideas for the optimization scheme of this article. this article will discuss the optimization measures of the odgm(1,1,tα) model in detail in the next section. the combined fractional-order accumulative generation operation the advantage of fractional-order accumulation generation operation (r-ago) is that it can choose the most suitable order to build the model through algorithms. compared with the traditional 1-ago, it is more adaptable. obviously, the r-ago can solve the first deficiency described in the previous section. at present, there are two popular r-agos, namely the r-ago proposed by wu [13] and the fractional-order hausdorff accumulation generation operation (δ-hago) proposed by chen et al. [17]. to further enhance the predictive ability of themodel,we combine these two measures and propose a new r-ago, which is defined as follows. theorem 1 if x(0) is the original time series and h(0) = ⎧⎨ ⎩ h(0) (k) = k  p=1 x(0) (p) ·[pδ − (p − 1)δ], δ ∈ r+ , k = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n ⎫⎬ ⎭ (11) is the fractional-order hausdorff accumulation generation sequence of x(0), then the combined fractional-order accumulation generation operator (cf-ago) of x(0) is 123 complex & intelligent systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 3467 h(r ) (k) = k  l=1  (r + k − l)  (k − l + 1) (r ) · h(0)(l) = k  l=1  (r + k − l)  (k − l + 1) (r ) · l  p=1 x(0) (p) · [pδ − (p − 1)δ]. (12) proof according to themethod proposed by chen et al. [17], the δ-hago of x(0) can be given as h(0)(k) = k  p=1 x(0) (p) · [pδ − (p − 1)δ], k = 1, 2, 3, . . . . (13) when r = 1, according to the 1-ago, we can get h(1) (k) = k  l=1 (k − l + 1) . . . (k − l + r − 1) (r − 1)! · h(0) (l) = k  l=1 h(0) (l). (14) similarly, when r = 2, the 2-agoof the δ-hagoof x(0) is h(2) (k) = k  l=1 (k − l + 1) (2 − 1)! · h(0) (l) = k  l=1 (k − l + 1) · h(0) (l). (15) supposing the n-ago of the δ-hago of x(0) is h(n) (k) = k  l=1 (k − l + 1) . . . (k − l + n − 1) (n − 1)! · h(0) (l), (16) then, when r = n + 1, we have h(n+1) (k) = k  l=1 l  j=1 (l − j + 1) . . . (l − j + n − 1) (n − 1)! ·h(0) ( j ) = 2  j=1  (1 − j + 2) . . .

(17) therefore, the r-ago of the δ-hago of x(0) is h(r ) (k) = k  l=1 (k − l + 1) . . . (k − l + r − 1) (r − 1)! ·h(0) (l) , r ∈ n+ . (18) according to the concept of gamma function, eq. (18) can be converted to h(r ) (k) = k  l=1  (r + k − l)  (k − l + 1) (r ) · h(0)(l) = k  l=1  (r + k − l)  (k − l + 1) (r ) · l  p=1 x(0) (p) · [pδ − (p − 1)δ]. (19) by the broad definition of the combinatorial number [25], it can be seen that when r ∈ r+, eq. (19) is also true. this completes the proof.  theorem 2 if h(0) is the fractional-order hausdorff accumulation generation sequence of x(0), and h(−r )={h(−r ) (1) , h(−r ) (2) , . . . , h(−r ) (n)}, r ∈ r+ (20) is the fractional-order inverse accumulative generation sequence of h(0), then the kth term in h(−r) can be represented by h(−r ) (k) = k−1  l=0 (−1)l ·  (r + 1)  (l + 1) (r + 1 − l) ·h(0) (k − l) , k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n.

(42) where s1 = μ1, s2 = (1 + μ21 ), sn = μ1sn−1 + sn−2, n ≥ 3, z1 = 1, zi = si−1 + zi−1. then, we substitute the  μ1, μ 2, μ 3 obtained by thewls into eq. (42), and the recursive formula of the model can be shown by h (r ) (k + 1) =  sk−1 h (r ) (2) +  sk−2 h (r ) (1) + μ2 k−2  i=1 s i (k − i + 1)α  +  zk−1 μ 3. (43) according to theorem 2, we can get h (0) (k) = k−1  l=0 (−1)l ·  (r+1)  (l+1) (r−l+1) · h (r ) (k − l) , k = 2, 3, · · · , h (0) (1) = h(0) (1) . (44) therefore, the prediction formula of cfodgmw(1,1,α) is x (0) (k) = h (0) (k) −  h (0) (k − 1) kδ − (k − 1)δ , k = 2, 3, · · · . (45) properties of the cfodgmw(1,1,˛) model convertibility 1.when theweight matrixw and structural parameters of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model takes different values, we have the following conclusions. 123 complex & intelligent systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 3471 (1) when w = i , the criterion for parameter estimation of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is the least square criterion, that is,  ϑ = argmin ϑ 1 n − 1 n  k=2 [h(r ) (k) −  h (r ) (k)] 2 . (46) (2) when w = diag{ 1 [h(r )(2)]2 , 1 [h(r )(3)]2 , . . . , 1 [h(r )(n)]2 }, the criterion for parameter estimation of the cfodgmw(1, 1,α) model is the minimum mean square relative error criterion, that is,  ϑ = argmin ϑ 1 n − 1 n  k=2 h(r ) (k) −  h (r ) (k) h(r ) (k)  2 . (47) (3) when δ = 1, r = 0, α = 0,w = i , the cfodgmw(1, 1,α) model degenerates to the dgm(1,1) model [24] based on midpoint difference. (4) when δ = 1, r = 0, α = 1,w = i , the cfodgmw(1, 1,α) model degenerates to the ndgm(1,1,k) model [26] based on midpoint difference. unbiasedness unbiasedness means that the forecasting model can completely fit a time series. since the modeling mechanism of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is too complex, it is very difficult to directly prove the unbiasedness of the model using the formula. therefore, we use examples to prove that the model is unbiased. theorem 3 the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is unbiased for time series satisfying the homogeneous or non-homogeneous laws. proof case 1: when δ = 1, r = 0, α = 0,w = i, eq. (37) (cfodgmw(1,1,α)) is transformed into x(1) (k + 1) = x(1) (k − 1) + μ1x(1) (k) + μ2. (48) obviously, eq. (48) is the expression of the dgm(1,1) model based on midpoint difference. when the time series satisfies the homogeneous law, that is,xfit + xpre = {2 · 3k , k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}+{2·3k , k = 6, 7}. the xfit is applied to establish the model, and xpre is applied to test the predictive ability of the model. according to eq. (41), we can get ψ = [ μ1, μ 2]t = [2.666666666666667, 7.999999999999950]t . then, we bring  μ1, μ 2 into eq. (48), and then according to the 1-iago, we can obtain x (0) (k) = 2 · 3k = x(0) (k) , k = 1, 2, · · · , 7. (49) case 2: when δ = 1, r = 0, α = 1,w = i, eq. (37) is turned into x(1) (k + 1) = x(1) (k − 1)+μ1 · x(1) (k)+μ2 ·kα+μ3. (50) then, eq. (50) is the expression of the ndgm(1,1,k) model. when the time series satisfies the non-homogeneous law, that is, xfit + xpre = {2 · 3k +2, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}+{2 · 3k +2, k = 6, 7}. the xfit is applied to establish the model, and xpre is applied to test the predictive ability of the model. according to eq. (41), we can get ψ = [ μ1, μ 2, μ 3]t = [2.666666666666660, −5.33333333333168, 11.999999999998451]t . (51) then, we bring μ1, μ 2, μ 3 into eq. (50), and then according to the 1-iago, we can obtain x (0) (k) = 2 · 3k + 2 = x(0) (k) , k = 1, 2, · · · , 7. (52) therefore, this complete the proof.  note that since there are many time series that conform to the homogeneous exponential law or approximate non-homogeneous exponential law in real life, the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model has a wide application background. the solutionmethod of the cfodgmw(1,1,˛) model from the expression of the cfodgmw(1,1,α)model, it can be seen that the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is built on the basis of the r,α,δ. then, the most important task is to determine the r, α, δ of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model. to solve the parameters r, α, δ, we consider establishing a programming model with errorminimization as the objective function 123 3472 complex & intelligent systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 and the modeling process of the model as constraints. this programming model can be expressed by min r,α,δ mape = 1 n−1 n  k=2  x(0)(k)−x (0) (k) x(0)(k)  2 × 100% s.t. ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ ψ = [ μ1, μ 2, μ 3]t = (xtwx) −1xtwϒ. h (r ) (k + 1) =  sk−1 h (r ) (2) +  s k−2 h (r ) (1) + μ2[ k−2  i=1 s i (k − i + 1)α] +  zk−1 μ 3. h (0) (k) = k−1  l=0 (−1)l  (r+1)  (l+1) (r−l+1) h (r ) (k − l) , k = 2, 3, · · · , h (0) (1) = h(0) (1) . x (0) (k) = h (0) (k)− h (0) (k−1) kδ−(k−1)δ , k = 2, 3, · · · . (53) obviously, the traditional method is difficult to solve the above-mentioned planning problem. here, we use the whale optimization algorithm (woa) [27] to solve the above planning problem to obtain the parameters r, α, δ that make the model have the smallest error. the calculation process of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is shown in fig. 3. validity in this section, the aging population of five regions in china is taken as cases to verify the validity of the proposed model. the five data sets are from the statistical yearbook for each region, as shown in table 1. the models used for comparison include exponential curve model (ecm), gm(1,1) model [1], polynomial regression model (pr) [28],fgm(1,1) model [29],ogm(1,1) model [30] and gmp(1,1,n) model with excellent predictive performance [10]. the aging population from 2010 to 2016 are applied to build models, and the last three data are applied to test the predictive ability of the models. the mapes of the seven predictive models are shown in table 2. in addition, to facilitate readers to observe the gap between the models, we visualized the data in table 2, as shown in fig. 4. it can be seen from fig. 4 that in the fitting stage, the cfodgmw(1,1,α)model has a winning rate of 60%, which is much higher than that of other models. therefore, the fitting performance of cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is better than that of its competitors. according to fig. 4 (right) we can clearly see that the winning rate of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is 100%, which means that the prediction performance of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is the best among all models. therefore, the validity of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is confirmed. fig. 3 schematic diagram of the calculation process of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model table 1 the number of aging

mape (%) of the seven models in the case of china’s aging population ing the training phase, which means that these two models are also tools with excellent fitting performance. although the gmp(1,1,n) model and fgm(1,1) model have better fitting performance than cfodgmw(1,1,α) model, we can see that there is little difference in their fitting performance. it is worth noting that the pink bar representing the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is the lowest in the test phase, meaning that its predictive performance is better than the other models. from the first figure shown in fig. 5, we can see that the curve of cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is very close to the curve of the real value, which indicates that the development trend of cfodgmw(1,1,α) model conforms to the actual situation. the ape in fig. 5 also implies that the performance of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is better than other models. in summary, compared with other models, the cfodgmw(1,1,α)model is more suitable for analyzing china’s aging population. beside, the running time ofwoa in this case is shown in table 6. forecasts and suggestions since the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model has won the competition with other models, this section will use it to forecast china’s aging population from 2020 to 2023 and give some corresponding policy recommendations according to the predicted results. inspired by the idea of metabolism [32], based on the parameters r, δ and α of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model described in section “numerical results”, the original data from 2008 to 2019 are used to establish the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model to predict china’s aging population from 2020 to 2023. the number of the aging population in the past 4 years is shown in fig. 6. according to the data shown in fig. 6, it can be seen that the aging population in china will further increase in the next few years, which is bound to have a huge impact on the development of chinese society. on the one hand, the sustained growth of the aging population and the declining birth rate indicates that china will completely become an “aging country”. the main reason for this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that young people in china are under great pressure in life, and their salary cannot support them to raise a newborn. in addition, the early “family planning” in china also contributed to this phenomenon. based on this, this article gives two related suggestions 1. to curb the surge in housing prices, the biggest living pressure of chinese young people comes from the continuous increase in housing prices. lower housing prices will inevitably lead to social unrest in china, but the chinese government can control housing prices to stabilize, which can reduce the pressure on the younger generation. 2. promoting the birth subsidy program. china should encourage young people to have children, and provide certain financial assistance to parents with multiple newborns. on the other hand, with the increase in the aging population, their huge medical expenditure directly promotes the increase in the total dependency ratio of the society, thereby reducing the growth rate of gdp, which has a certain hindering effect on the economic development of chinese society. given this situation, the chinese government should speed up the coverage of insurance business, expand the applicable scope of the insurance business, so that more aging population can enjoy the benefits of insurance business. conclusion considering the exponential growth law of population and the applicable scope of the grey forecastingmodel, this paper proposes an optimized discrete grey forecastingmodel based on the wls and combined fractional-order accumulation operation. by analyzing themodelingmechanism of the proposed model, it is found that the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model 123 3476 complex & intelligent systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 fig. 6 the growth rate and number of china’s aging population in the next 4 years can be transformed into other types ofgmmodels by changing its structural parameters, and it is unbiased for the time series satisfying homogeneous or non-homogeneous laws. these two aspects prove that cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is a kind of prediction model with excellent predictive performance. subsequently, the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model and its comparative models are used to study china’s aging population. numerical results show that the prediction performance of the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is better than other predictionmodels. at the end of the article, the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is used to forecast the aging population in china in the next 4 years, and some corresponding recommendations are given according to the forecast results. in addition, although the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is a forecasting model with excellent predictive performance, it still has some defects. according to its modeling steps, we can see that the information of the first data in the time series is ignored when the cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is built, and the information is hard-won and it is a shame towaste it. how to make full use of the first data to build a more reasonable cfodgmw(1,1,α) model is still a problem. acknowledgements this work was
