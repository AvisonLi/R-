first-degree stochastic dominance (afsd) as a distribution-ranking criterion for all nonsatiable decision makers with infinite investment horizons. by assuming that the terminal wealth follows a log-normal distribution and that themarginal utility is bounded, he offers the necessary and sufficient distributional condition for afsd. given levy’s setting, we provide a counterexample to show that his condition is not necessary and offer the correct equivalent distributional condition for afsd. history: accepted by karl diether, finance. funding: this work was financially supported by the

life-cycle planning, and the optimal investment in the long run has become an increasingly important concern. to solve the optimal investment problem with an indefinitely long horizon, levy (2016) incorporates the impacts of an investment horizon into the concept of stochastic dominance to support the maximum geometricmean (mgm) strategy as a solution for an aging population. he establishes a new notion of stochastic dominance, referred to as “asymptotic first-degree stochastic dominance” (afsd). afsd is a distribution-ranking criterion that defines a distribution as dominating another one in terms of first-degree stochastic dominance (fsd) when the investment period goes to infinity. assuming that the return in each period is independent and identically log-normally distributed, levy (2016) claims in his theorem 1 that a strategy dominates others in terms of afsd if and only if (iff) it generates a higher geometric mean and a higher volatility. although levy’s notion of afsd sheds light on the solution of the investment decision in the long run, the distributional condition for afsd given in his theorem1 is inaccurate. in this comment, we first demonstrate that higher geometric means and higher volatilities are not necessary for afsd. we then show that the correct condition for afsd is higher geometric means together with the same volatilities. proofs are relegated to the appendix. 2. a counterexample to levy’s condition for afsd consider the buy-and-hold strategy: an investor neither withdraws nor injects new cash into her portfolio, but keeps reinvesting her portfolio in each period. let xt denote the rate of gross return at time t and wt denote the terminal wealth of a uni-dollar investment after t periods. the xt’s are independently and identically distributed. let u denote the von neumann–morgenstern utility function and ft and gt denote two cumulative distribution functions of wt. then, efu(wt) and egu(wt) represent the expected utility functions of wt under ft and gt, respectively. definition 1 (levy 2016, p. 1416). ft dominates gt by afsd if and only if lim t→∞ [efu(wt) − egu(wt)] ≥ 0 for all u with u ≥ 0, and for some nondecreasing u there is a strict inequality. 2792 to gain tractability, levy (2016) further assumes that log xt follows n(μf, σ2 f ) and n(μg, σ2 g ) under f and g, respectively. the “necessary and sufficient condition” for afsd provided by levy (2016, theorem 1) is as follows: alleged theorem 1 (levy 2016, p. 1417). assume an investment horizon of t periods and that ft and gt are lognormal distributions. assume that μf > μg; namely, f has a higher geometric mean than g. then, for t→∞, ft and gt are log-normal distributions, and in this case ft dominates gt by asymptotic-fsd iff μf > μg and σf ≥ σg, provided that the marginal utility is bounded. the following counterexample shows that levy’s condition is not necessary. counterexample 1. assume that ft and gt are log-normal distributions and that the marginal utility is bounded. ft dominates gt by afsd if μf − μg ≥ (σg − σf) ( σg + ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ σ2 g + 2μg √ ) and σf < σg. the above case is empirically relevant. for example, let f and g correspond to the msci world index and the standard & poor’s (s&p) 500 index, respectively. from 1926 to 2010, the annualized means and volatilities of the rates of returnwere 10.81% and 18.06% for the msci and 9.19% and 19.96% for the s&p 500 (bodie et al. 2013, figure 5.3). assuming that the gross annual returns of both assets follow log-normal distributions, we have μf  0.0895, σf  0.1619, μg  0.0715, and σg  0.1813, which satisfy μf − μg  0.0180 > 0.0117  (σg − σf) ( σg + ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ σ2 g + 2μg √ ) and σf < σg. thus, if the underlying dynamics of the two assets persist in the future, then the msci dominates the s&p 500 by afsd, provided that the marginal utility is bounded. 3. a new characterization of afsd in definition 1, there is no additional restriction on the utility function other than u ≥ 0. this feature shares the same spirit as the classic concept of fsd in minimizing specific assumptions about decision-makers’ risk attitudes. however, in the characterization of the distributional condition, levy (2016) imposes the restriction of bounded marginal utility. we now remove this restriction and offer the true necessary and sufficient condition for afsd. theorem 1. assume that ft and gt are log-normal distributions. ft dominates gt by afsd, if and only if μf > μg and σf  σg. theorem1 resolves the debate on the optimality of the mgm strategy in the long run for log-normal distributions. the mgm strategy—choosing f if μf >μg—is optimal from the perspective of utility maximization if and only if σf  σg. theorem 1 confirms that afsd yields exactly the same condition as fsd with a finite horizon as found by levy (1973, theorem 4). conceptually, afsd appears to be less demanding than fsd because it only requires that efu(wt) ≥ egu(wt) in the limit of t→∞ and allows for any violation of efu(wt) ≥ egu(wt) at finite horizons. however, the potential tolerance of the violation is removed by the power utility class, with which efu(wt) <egu(wt) at some finite horizon t can lead to limt→∞[efu(wt) − egu(wt)]  −∞. accordingly, the condition in levy (2016) of bounded marginal utility is not innocuous: it excludes the power utility class, limits the utility loss, and relaxes the important requirement σf  σg. although theorem 1 spells out the simple distribution condition ensuring that f is preferable to g in the long run for all nonsatiated utility maximizers, the requirement that σf  σg is too restrictive to implement it in practice. thus, how to make the notion of asymptotic stochastic dominance more applicable through excluding the utility functions that are less or not at all interesting from a practical or theoretical perspective is an open question for future research. acknowledgments the authors thank haim levy, departmental editor karl diether, the associate editor, and the anonymous referee for the valuable comments and suggestions. all authors share

1 σg ) be the unique intersection point of ft and gt and write his equation (4) as efu(wt) − egu(wt)  i + ii, where i  ∫ w0 0 [gt(w) − ft(w)]u(w)dw and ii  ∫ ∞ w0 [gt(w) − ft(w)]u(w)dw. with σf <σg, ft intersects gt from below, and thus i ≥ 0 while ii ≤ 0. as assumed by levy (2016), letm denote an upper bound on the marginal utility. the utility loss ii can be controlled by |ii| ≤ m ∫ ∞ w0

of the proof. therefore, if σf <σg and μf − μg ≥ (σg − σf) ( σg + ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ σ2 g + 2μg √ ) , then limt→∞[efu(wt) − egu(wt)]  limt→∞ i ≥ 0. in addition, under the proposed condition, we also have
