(1) for the t-period distributions the crossover point is at the point z0(t): z0(t)  t̅̅μf t √ σf − t̅̅μg t √ σg 1 ̅̅ t √ σf − ̅̅1 t √ σg  t · z0. (2) 2787 thus, z0(t) converges to either +∞ or −∞, depending on the sign of z0. the denominator of z0 is negativee, because σf > σg. hence, if μf σf > μg σg , z0 is negative, and z0(t) ̅̅̅→ t→∞ −∞. if μf σf <μg σg , z0 is positive, and z0(t) ̅̅̅→ t→∞ +∞. note that z0(t) is in terms of log(returns). in terms of the returns, x, the crossover point is at x0(t)  ez0(t), and the two cases are: x0(t) ̅̅̅→ t→∞ 0 if μf σf > μg σg , and x0(t) ̅̅̅→ t→∞ +∞ if μf σf <μg σg . these two cases have different implications for preference dominance in the long run. to see this, let us use levy’s equation (4) for the expected utility difference between the two portfolios: euf −eug  ∫x0 0 [g(x) − f(x)]u’(x)dx + ∫∞ x0 [g(x) − f(x)]u’(x)dx ≡ i− + i+, (3) where we define the first integral as i− and the second integral as i+ (f and g represent the cumulative distributions of total returns, and we are assuming, without loss of generality, that the initial wealth is 1, thus, the total return x is equal to the terminal wealth). i− is the integral over the violation area, where f < g, and it is thus negative, whereas i+ is positive. levy (2016) argues that as t→∞, x0(t)→0, and therefore, if u’(x) is bounded from above by m, then i−→0, implying that euf >eug; that is, stocks yield a higher expected utility than bonds. however, notice that this is true only in the case μf σf > μg σg . in the case μf σf <μg σg , which is empirically more relevant, as discussed below,we have x0(t)→∞. in this case,with the empirical parameters the violation area still converges to zero, and it is still true that i−→0. however, the marginal utility u’(x) in i+ also converges to zero for most standard utility functions. thus, i+ may also converge to zero, and this convergence may be faster than the convergence to zero of the negative i−. thus, it is possible that euf <eug (i.e., bonds are preferred to stocks in the long run).2 levy (2016) only treats the case x0(t)→0 and ignores the more relevant case x0(t)→∞because he uses an erroneous formula for z0(t). instead of the correct equation (2), he uses z0(t)  μf − μg σg − σf ̅̅ t √ (see his equation (3), p. 1417), which implies x0(t)→0. levy himself does use the correct formula for z0(t) elsewhere (see, for example, levy 2015, p. 179). levy’s argument for the mgm in the long run can be restored if one adds a lower bound condition on u’(x), ensuring that it does not converge to 0 “too fast”: the stock portfolio is preferred in the long run if: u’(x) ≥ x−β where β  1 + 1 2μf ( μf − z0 σf )2 − z0 μf , (4) and z0 is given by equation (1). the proof is provided in the appendix. note that several standard preferences do not satisfy condition (4). for example, for the negative exponential utility u(x)  −e−bx, we have u’(x)  be−bx, and this marginal utility converges to zero faster than the power function x−β. for the generalized power function suggested by samuelson (1989), and used by levy (2016) (equation 7): u(x)  (x +a)1−α 1 − α , the marginal utility is u’(x)  (x + a)−α, and condition (4) is met for large x (where a becomes negligible) if and only if α < β. figure 1. normal distributions of log(returns) notes. f represents the stock portfolio, with higher mean and higher variance, and g represents the bond portfolio. panel (a) shows the probability density functions, denoted by f and g, and panel (b) shows the cumulative distribution functions, denoted by f and g. z0 is the unique intersection point of the cumulative distributions, given by equation (1). the range to the left of z0 is the “violation range”, where f > g. levy: comment on “aging population, retirement, and risk taking” 2788 management science, 2020, vol. 66, no. 6, pp. 2787–2791, © 2018 informs condition (4) is sufficient but not necessary. thus, some utility functions may violate (4) yet still prefer stocks in the long run. how common is the violation of the “stocks for the long run” argument? it turns out that for the empirical return parameters, and for some standard preferences with marginal utility bounded from above, bonds are indeed preferred over stocks, even in the very long run. figure 2 illustrates this point. we consider two asset classes: stocks (denoted by f), and t-bills (denoted by g). the return distributions are assumed to be log-normal, with the empirical annual parameters reported in table 14.5 of levy (2015): μf  0.097, σf  0.195, μg 0.034, σg 0.029. notice that with the empirical parameters we have μf/σf 0.497<μg/σg  1.172; that is, we are in the case x0(t) ̅̅̅→ t→∞ +∞. for these empirical parameters we have β  1.505 (see equation (4) and the appendix). the expected utilities of the stock and bond portfolios are calculated numerically for various horizons, t. panels (a) and (b) of figure 2 show the generalized constant relative risk aversion (crra) utility function u(x) (x+a)1−α 1−α , with parameters used in table 1 of levy (2016). panel (a) shows the expected utility difference euf−eug for the generalized crra utility function with a = 1 and α 0.5. in this case α<β and condition (4) is met. indeed, the expected utility (eu) difference is positive for large horizons t (and in this case also for small t). panel (b) shows the expected utility difference euf−eug for the generalized crra utility function with a = 1 and α 10. in this case α>β and condition (4) does not hold. the figure reveals that the eu difference is negative even for very long horizons; that is, bonds are preferred. for the negative exponential utility function u(x)  −e−b·x with b = 4, shown in panel (c), stocks are preferred in the short run, but bonds are preferred in the log run. figure 2. expected utility difference between the stock and bond portfolios as a function of the investment horizon, t notes. the empirical return parameters are employed.

management science, 2020, vol. 66, no. 6, pp. 2787–2791, © 2018 informs 2789 the above analysis considers a dichotomist choice between stocks and bonds. if diversification between bonds and stocks is considered, how does the optimal stock–bond mix change with the investment horizon? figure 3 shows the optimal investment proportion in stocks as a function of the investment horizon (calculated numerically). for both the exponential preference and the generalized crra preference with α  10, the optimal weight in stocks decreases, rather than increases, with the investment horizon. this is consistent with levy’s (2016) own numerical analysis in his table 1 and his conclusion, “for very large and presumably irrelevant risk aversion parameter, the optimal portfolio tilts to a corporate bond portfolio even for very large investment horizons” (p. 1423).3 this comment shows that maximizing the geometric mean may not be the optimal strategy for the long run, even if the marginal utility is bounded from above. it is interesting to note that even though geometric mean maximization is not generally optimal as a long-run strategy, in the short run, when realistic borrowing constraints are imposed, the geometric mean is more correlated with expected utility than popular performance measures such as the sharpe ratio or alpha (levy 2017). thus, even though the present analysis shows that the geometric mean is not an unequivocal criterion for fund selection for the long-run, levy (2017) argues that the geometric mean is nonetheless a very useful criterion for fund selection for the short run. acknowledgments the author thanks gustavo manso, the department editor, the anonymous associate editor, and the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions. appendix if the utility function u and return distribution parameters are such that i+ > |i−|, then the stock (f) is preferred over the bond (g). we show below that |i−| is bounded from above by an expression of the formc · e−dt. thus, i+ may also converge to 0 with t, as long as this convergence is slower than the convergence of |i−|. a sufficient condition for this is u’(x) ≥x−β, as shown below. upper bound on |i−| |i−|  ∫x0 0 [f(x) −g(x)]u’(x)dx < m ∫x0 0 f(x)dx (recall that for x< x0 f(x) >g(x) and that u’(x) ≤m). f(x) is the cumulative lognormal distribution, thus, log(x) is distributed normally, and f(x)  φ ( log(x) − μf σf ) , where φ is the cumulative standard normal. note that z0  log(x0)<μf, (the intersection of the two distributions is in the left tail) hence for x <x0 we have log(x0) − μf < 0. for t <0, φ(t) is bounded from above by φ(t) < 1 − t e− t2 2 (see, for example, abramowitz and stegun 1964). thus, f(x) < σf μf − log(x) e −12 ( log(x) − μf σf )2 < σf μf − log(x0) e −12 ( log(x) − μf σf )2 . as the horizon t grows, σf grows as ̅̅ t √ while μf and log(x0)  z0 grow as t. thus, for a long enough horizon the fraction σf μf − log(x0) ̅̅ t √ t < 1, and we can replace it by 1 in the upper bound: f(x)< e −12 ( log(x) − μf σf )2 . hence, we have: |i−| < m ∫x0 0 e −12 ( log(x) − μf σf )2 dx. using the change of variables: q ≡ μf − log(x) σf implying x  eμf−qσf and dx  −σfeμf−qσfdq, we obtain: |i−| < −mσfeμf ∫ μf−log(x0) σf ∞ e−12 q2−qσfdq  mσfeμf ∫∞ μf − z0 σf e−12 q2−qσfdq  mσfeμf + σ2 f 2 ∫∞ μf − z0 σf e−12 (q+σf)2dq defining s ≡ q + σfwe obtain: |i−| <mσfeμf +σ2 f 2 ∫∞ μf − z0+σ2 f σf e−12 s2ds  mσfeμf + σ2 f 2 ̅̅̅̅ 2π √ ·φ ( − μf − z0 + σ2 f σf ) . using again the bound φ(t) < 1 − t e− t2 2 for t < 0 with t ≡ − μf − z0+σ2 f σf , and using the fact that t grows indefinitely with the horizon, so that eventually 1 − t <1, we finally have: |i−| < mσfeμf + σ2 f 2 ̅̅̅̅ 2π √ e −12 ( μf − z0+σ2 f σf )2  mσf ̅̅̅̅ 2π √ e −12 ( μf − z0 σf )2 +z0 , where the last equality is obtained after a little algebraic reorganization of the exponent. note that for the t-period horizon μf grows to t · μf, σf grows to ̅̅ t √ · σf, and z0 grows to t · z0. thus, as the horizon increases, |i−| is bounded from above by c · e−dt, where c  ̅̅̅̅ 2π √ mσf, and d  12 ( μf − z0 σf )2 − z0. with the empirical parameters, we have d > 0, and thus |i−| converges to 0 as the horizon t increases. lower bound on i+ i+  ∫∞ x0 [g(x) − f(x)]u’(x)dx > ∫eμf eμf − σf [g(x) − f(x)]u’(x)dx > u’(eμf ) ∫eμf eμf − σf [g(x) − f(x)]dx, levy: comment on “aging population, retirement, and risk taking” 2790 management science, 2020, vol. 66, no. 6, pp. 2787–2791, © 2018 informs where we first restrict the integral to only part of the range (from one standard deviation in log(x) to the left of the peak of the stock pdf until is peak) and then take the value of u’ at the end of the range, which is the minimal value under the assumption of risk aversion (u”≤ 0). the choice of taking one standard deviation to the left of the mean is rather arbitrary, as will become evident. notice that as μf >μg, when the horizon is long enough the pdf of g is negligible in the range discussed, and we can approximate g ≈ 1, yielding i+ > u’(eμf ) ∫eμf eμf − σf [g(x) − f(x)]dx ≈ u’(eμf ) ∫eμf eμf − σf [1 − f(x)]dx. at the beginning of the integration range, we have 1 − f(x)  1 −φ( − 1)  0.84, and this decreases monotonically until the end of the range, where we have 1 − f(x)  1 −φ(0)  0.5. thus, the integral is bounded from below by 0.5 times the length of the segment over which we integrate: i+ > 0.5 ·u’(eμf )(eμf − eμf−σf )  0.5 ·u’(eμf )eμf (1 − e−σf ). for the t-period horizon, we have: i+ > 0.5 ·u’(eμf · t)eμf · t(1 − e−σf · t). for large t, the term 1 − e−σf · tconverges to 1 and we have: i+ > 0.5 ·u’(eμf · t) · eμf · t. sufficient condition for preference for the stock as t becomes large using the above upper bound on |i−| and lower bound on i+, a sufficient condition for i+ > |i−| is: 0.5 ·u’ ( eμf · t) · eμf · t >ce−dt, or u’ ( eμf · t) > 2ce−(d+μf)t. defining x ≡ eμf · t (and thus t  log(x)/μf), this translates to: u’(x) > 2ce − ( d+μf μf

is governed by the value of exponent (i.e., if β1 > β2, then for large enough x, c1 · x−β1 < c2 · x−β2 for any positive c’s). for the empirical parameters, μf  0.097, σf  0.195, μg  0.034, σg 

of the violation area; see levy (2009). 3 the author is grateful to the anonymous referee for pointing this out. references abramowitz m, stegun ia (1964) handbook of mathematical functions (courier
