and 40% of trauma patients are now older than the age of 65, a number that has roughly doubled since 2006.1–3 a national registry study of seriously ill trauma patients in the united kingdom showed that the mean age of a trauma patient increased from 36 years in 1990 to 54 years in 2013. the same study showed that the proportion of trauma patients older than the age of 75 increased from 8% to

the resuscitation and management of patients who are older adults and present with severe injuries will be a common part of any trauma practice in the coming decades. what defines geriatric trauma? there is no universally agreed on age cutoff that defines a geriatric trauma patient. a wide range of cutoffs has been used in defining and studying geriatric trauma patients. 6,7 age 65 is commonly used in research and clinical settings, although this arbitrary number is likely based more on historical than physiologic factors. one crosssectional study of more than 75,000 trauma patients showed that when stratified by injury severity score, mortality increased significantly older than the age of 70.6 the authors therefore argue that 70 would be a more appropriate age at which to define a geriatric trauma patient. another retrospective study of more than 100,000 patients demonstrated a significant increase in mortality after the age of 57.7 rather than memorizing an age cutoff, it is important for the emergency physician to be aware that frailty, increasing comorbidities, decreased physiologic reserve, and other factors that contribute to worse outcomes in geriatric trauma patients can occur at different ages and must be assessed on an individualized basis. it is worthwhile to note that the preferred term for geriatric patients, endorsed by the journal of the american geriatric society, is “older adults.” we are increasingly aware of the importance of language in molding conscious and subconscious attitudes. the use of the terms “elderly,” “elders,” and “seniors” are associated with negative attitudes and may result in patients receiving substandard care.8 mechanisms of injury and injury patterns in geriatric trauma geriatric trauma patients have higher mortality than their younger counterparts, even when matched for illness severity.5,9–11 they are more likely to require intensive care unit (icu) admission and be discharged to a long-term care facility or nursing home than their younger counterparts.12 a seemingly minor mechanism is capable of causing serious injury and complications. low-energy mechanisms cause most geriatric trauma,13 with falls and motorvehicle collisions making up the first and second most frequent causes, respectively.14 falls are exceptionally common among older adults; 27% of adults 65 years of age and older fall each year.15 even ground-level falls can cause significant injury, and are associated with a 1-year mortality rate of 33.2%. risk factors for falls include a history of falls, cognitive impairment, visual impairment, polypharmacy, home hazards, orthostatic hypotension, and gait instability.16 in addition, medical events related to underlying comorbidities are the precipitants of a traumatic injury. falls and motor vehicle accidents, for example, can be caused by underlying orthostatic hypotension, cardiac syncope, or cerebrovascular accident. anatomic and physiologic considerations in geriatric trauma patients anatomic and physiologic changes related to aging can affect the clinical presentation and early management of geriatric trauma patients. table 1 summarizes age-related anatomic and physiologic changes and their clinical implications in trauma management. triage algorithms for injured patients often rely on the presence of abnormal vital signs to identify the presence of severe injury.17 however, injured older adults often present atypically and can have “normal” vital signs even in the face of severe 184 lau et al downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan university from clinicalkey.com/nursing by elsevier on april 18, 2025. for personal use only. no other uses without permission. copyright ©2025. elsevier inc. all rights reserved. inury.18–20 multiple factors that may affect vital signs in the older adult include underlying cardiovascular comorbidities, medications (eg, b-blockers), and physiologic changes related to aging itself. multiple groups have suggested modifications to triage algorithms to better identify severely injured older adults. for example, a heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure less than 110 mm hg as a cutoff value has been associated with increased mortality in the geriatric trauma patient, and have been suggested as a criteria for trauma team activation.21 the shock index, defined as heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure, is a tool used as a predictor of mortality, critical bleeding, and need for massive transfusion in trauma patients.22 given the unreliability of vital signs in older adults, the age- adjusted shock index (aasi) (box 1) has been proposed as a more sensitive alternative. 23 in older adults, an aasi of greater than 50 was associated with a mortality of approximately 10% and seemed to be a predictor of early mortality and the need for blood products.23 although the aasi is an important tool for clinicians, used alone it is not sensitive enough to rule out critical injuries. table 1 age-related changes and clinical implications in trauma24,25 organ system age-related changes clinical

addition to vital signs, other aspects of the trauma assessment may be confounded by older adults’ underlying comorbidities. for example, it may be difficult to assess neurocognitive status, and identify a treatable head injury, in a patient with dementia. patients with neurocognitive disorders likely have more difficulty providing a history or localizing pain. the presence of osteoporosis and frailty may cause a minor mechanism (eg, ground level fall) to result in severe multisystem injuries. overall, the clinician assessing an older adult after a traumatic mechanism of injury must maintain a high level of suspicion that severe injury may be present and should not rely exclusively on vital signs and other physiologic measure to exclude the presence of severe injury. frailty the term frailty describes a dynamic state of decreased reserves in multiple domains including physical, cognitive, psychological, and social, which can lead to vulnerability and increased risk of adverse health outcomes.26 there is no consensus definition and there are multiple validated instruments that are used to measure an individual’s level of frailty.27 for example, the canadian study of health and aging clinical frailty scale is a commonly used and easily interpretable frailty scale (fig. 1, table 2). preinjury frailty is strongly associated with adverse outcomes following injury including mortality, in-hospital complications, and adverse discharge disposition (ie, long-term care facility).28–31 frailty is likely a stronger predictor of outcome than age or comorbidities.32 the association between frailty and adverse outcomes in geriatric trauma patients has been demonstrated consistently by multiple frailty measures use in various clinical contexts.33 as such, an assessment of preinjury frailty can identify those at highest risk of adverse outcomes; early identification of these patients may allow for the mobilization of specialized resources (eg, lower threshold for icu admission, early assessment by an interdisciplinary team). frailty screening for all geriatric trauma patients and development of an institutional frailty standardized care pathway is recommended by the american college of surgeons.34 trauma systems and trauma in older adults undertriage of older adults with severe injury is a systemic issue across multiple jurisdictions. 35,36 a multitude of studies have shown that older adults with severe traumatic injuries are less likely to be transported to a trauma center and to have trauma team activation, compared with younger patients.35–40 in the prehospital setting, standard adult physiologic parameters have poor sensitivity for severe injury in older adults and may lead to missed severe injuries in geriatric patients.35 as a result, multiple prehospital trauma triage guidelines emphasize advanced age as a special consideration for the triage of injured patients, with lower threshold for trauma center transport for older adults.17,34,41,42 in addition to different field triage, multiple guidelines also support a lower threshold for trauma team activation for older adults treated at trauma box 1 age-adjusted shock index heart rate ðbpmþ

these modifications increase the sensitivity of triage criteria, their specificity is lowered.43 although there is a concern that system resources might be overwhelmed if triage criteria are further modified and more older adults are triaged to trauma centers, prevailing evidence suggests that undertriage, rather than overtriage, remains the prevalent issue affecting severely injured older adults. even among adults meeting ems field trauma triage criteria, a large proportion are undertriaged, with older adults being overrepresented among those that are transported to a nontrauma center.44 although triage criteria suggest older adults at higher risk of adverse outcomes should have lower thresholds for trauma center transfer, such risk factors as frailty and advance age are paradoxically associated with a lower likelihood of transfer to trauma center care.44,45 we propose that addressing systemic undertriage of older adults with severe injury is one of the most pressing issues in trauma care in the next two decades. trauma center performance older adults who are treated at a trauma center have lower morbidity and mortality when compared with those treated at a nontrauma center.46 despite this, there exists significant variation in outcomes across different trauma centers.47 the reasons for this variation are multifactorial. volume is one predictor of outcomes, where a higher volume of geriatric trauma at a given trauma center is associated with decreased mortality. 48,49 the proportion of geriatric trauma patients that a trauma center treats is independently associated with lower mortality, and may play a larger role than absolute volume.50 however, the factors accounting for significant survival variation across trauma centers are poorly understood. fig. 1. clinical frailty scale. trauma in the aging population 187 downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan university from clinicalkey.com/nursing by elsevier on

anatomic and physiologic changes of normal aging can complicate airway management. 51 lips are often dry, thin, and more prone to laceration with minimal manipulation from laryngoscopy. teeth may be absent or loose. dentures are common and should be removed before intubation. saliva production is generally reduced among older adults and this may make laryngoscope blade insertion difficult.51 despite the classic teaching that being edentulous makes bag-mask ventilation more difficult, multiple large studies have failed to consistently find this to be true.52–54 decreased neck mobility is common among older adults and can lead to difficulty with laryngoscopy. 55 additionally, multiple studies have shown that manual inline stabilization table 2 clinical frailty scale26 1 very fit people who are robust, active, energetic, and motivated. they tend to exercise regularly and are among the fittest for their age. 2 fit people have no active disease symptoms but are less fit than category 1. often, they exercise or are very active occasionally, such as seasonally. 3 managing well people whose medical problems are well controlled, even if occasionally symptomatic, but often are not regularly active beyond routine walking. 4 living with very mild frailty previously “vulnerable,” this category marks early transition from complete independence. although not dependent on others for daily help, often symptoms limit activities. a common complaint is being “slowed up” and/or being tired during the day. 5 living with mild frailty people who often have more evident slowing, and need help with high order instrumental activities of daily living (finances, transportation, heavy housework). typically, mild frailty progressively impairs shopping and walking outside alone, meal preparation, medications, and begins to restrict light housework. 6 living with moderate frailty people who need help with all outside activities and with keeping house. inside, they often have problems with stairs and need help with bathing and might need minimal assistance (cuing, standby) with dressing. 7 living with severe frailty completely dependent for personal care, from whatever cause (physical or cognitive). even so, they seem stable and not at high risk of dying (within w6 mo). 8 living with very severe frailty completely dependent for personal care and approaching end of life. typically, they could not recover from even a minor illness. 9 terminally ill approaching the end of life. this category applies to people with a life expectancy <6 mo, who are not otherwise living with severe frailty. (many terminally ill people can still exercise until very close to death). 188 lau et al downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan university from clinicalkey.com/nursing by

videolaryngoscopy should be first line, because it is associated with an improved first pass success rate and may be especially useful in a trauma patient where cervical immobilization is required.59,60 cardiovascular and respiratory changes in older adults occur because of normal aging, the increased prevalence of disease, and polypharmacy. the end result is an increased sensitivity to medications and decreased physiologic reserve.61 preexisting coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and diastolic or systolic dysfunction can limit cardiac output in older adults with hemorrhagic shock or medication-induced vasodilation.62,63 underlying hypertension is common, and what is an apparently normal blood pressure may represent significant hypotension for the older patient.19 caution must be used when administering sedative medications as a part of induction for rapid sequence intubation. although no induction medication is hemodynamically neutral, such agents as ketamine or etomidate have generally been preferred because they cause less peri-intubation hypotension.64,65 given concerns for adrenal suppression and recent data showing increased mortality with etomidate, ketamine is likely the safest option for all trauma patients. regardless of which induction medication is used, doses should generally be reduced by 40% to 50% for older adults to avoid hypotension.63,66 aging causes numerous mechanical and physiologic changes that lead to decreased global pulmonary reserve, predisposing patients to hypoxemia. increased lung parenchymal compliance and increased closing volume leads to the collapse of small airways. decreased compliance of the chest wall leads to increased work of breathing.61 oxygen diffusion capacity is reduced.51 older adults are more susceptible to aspiration because of decreased protective cough and swallowing reflexes. short periods of altered breathing may be less well tolerated because of decreased compensatory ventilatory responses to hypoxemia or hypercarbia.61 investigations elevated lactate and base deficit are associated with significantly increased mortality in normotensive geriatric trauma patients and should be part of the initial bloodwork drawn. older trauma patients with a lactate greater than 4 mmol/l or base deficit less than -6 meq/l have an approximately 40% mortality rate.67,68 several studies have found that lactate greater than or equal to 2.5 mmol/l is independently associated with increased mortality.69,70 these elevated markers are associated with a high probability of severe injury and mortality in all trauma patients, and may be particularly concerning in older patients despite normal vital signs. cardiac troponin should also be considered as part of the initial trauma panel for the older patient. with increased prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities among older adults, the clinician must consider cardiac pathology as a cause of the trauma and/or a secondary complication caused by the stress of traumatic injuries (eg, type ii myocardial infarction). an elevated troponin is an independent prognostic factor predicting allcause morbidity and mortality in geriatric patients without acute coronary syndrome and should therefore be measured in the context of trauma.71 anticoagulation reversal many older adults are on anticoagulants for various indications. prompt assessment of the severity of injury and extent of bleeding, along with laboratory testing (eg, coagulation studies) and appropriate diagnostic imaging are required to determine if immediate anticoagulation reversal is required. for urgent surgical interventions, presence of hemorrhagic shock, need for transfusion, and major traumatic injuries, reversal trauma in the aging population 189 downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan university from clinicalkey.com/nursing by elsevier on april 18, 2025. for personal use only. no other uses without permission. copyright ©2025. elsevier inc. all rights reserved. should be immediately initiated. intracranial hemorrhage is also an indication for anticoagulation reversal because it reduces hemorrhage progression and mortality.72 traumatic brain injury with physiologic changes related to aging, white matter and cerebral vasculature become more susceptible to injury.73 geriatric patients with traumatic brain injury (tbi) experience higher morbidity and mortality, slower recovery, and worse outcomes. 74–77 falls from standing height or from low height are the leading cause of tbi in older adults.78 the glasgow coma scale (gcs) is not a reliable tool to assess tbi in a geriatric trauma patient because of higher prevalence of preexisting comorbidities and conditions, such as neurocognitive disorders, cognitive impairment, delirium, and polypharmacy. 79,80 other factors, such as age-related cerebral atrophy, can also lead to delayed clinical findings because it provides more space for an intracranial hemorrhage to expand. furthermore, older adults were found to have worse outcomes despite better gcs scores than younger patients with more severe or comparable injuries. 81,82 as such, clinicians should be cautious and not be falsely reassured by the clinical assessment and gcs score in a geriatric trauma patient. there is currently no validated geriatric tbi neuroimaging guideline. there are multiple validated clinical decision rules to assist clinicians with making the decision to investigate with computed tomography (ct) head imaging in the context of adult blunt head trauma, including the canadian ct head rule, new orleans criteria, and the national emergency x-ray utilization study (nexus) ii head ct rule.83,84 however, older age is listed as a high-risk factor for intracranial trauma for these rules and therefore generally support the routine use of ct head for all older adults. canadian ct head rule and nexus ii identified patients greater than or equal to the age of 65 as a high-risk factor requiring imaging, whereas new orleans criteria listed greater than the age of 60. the mild tbi clinical policy from the american college of emergency physician also supports these recommendations.85 the decision to pursue diagnostic imaging should also take into consideration the patient’s goals of care and incorporate shared decision making. spine injuries decreased bone mineral density and degenerative changes predispose older adults to increased risk of spinal injuries. older adults are also more likely to have baseline comorbidities, such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, disk disease, rheumatic disorders, and spinal stenosis. older patients are therefore at risk for severe spinal injury despite seemingly minor trauma, such as falling from standing height.86 in this population, midline cervical spine (c-spine) tenderness is often absent, and is an unreliable indicator of fracture.87,88 because of degenerative changes and decreased lower c-spine mobility, geriatric patients have an increased incidence of injuries at the craniocervical junction and upper c-spine, especially at the level of c2 and the odontoid. 89 type ii odontoid fractures are one of the most common c-spine fractures among older adults.86 as with tbi, there is a lack of high-quality evidence currently to support the use of clinical decision rules in the older adult population. the canadian c-spine rule considers patients older than 65 years of age as a high-risk criterion and therefore recommends imaging for all older adults.90 for the nexus criteria, studies have shown variable sensitivity in older adults, ranging from65.9%to 100%.91–93 multiple studies have questioned the validity of this tool to rule out the need for imaging for older adults.91,93 190 lau et al downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan university from clinicalkey.com/nursing by elsevier on april 18, 2025. for personal use only. no other uses without permission. copyright ©2025. elsevier inc. all rights reserved. given the high risk of c-spine fractures despite low-energy mechanisms and atypical clinical presentations, there should be a low threshold to order diagnostic imaging in older patients. plain radiographs for c-spine injuries have a false-negative rate of 15% to 40% and are also particularly poor at diagnosing dense fractures.89,94 ct, not plain radiographs, should therefore be performed.95 for geriatric trauma patients who require a ct head, a concurrent ct of the c-spine should be strongly considered because there is a 5% likelihood of fracture, regardless of intracranial injury.94 timely spinal precaution clearance is particularly critical among injured older adults. prolonged immobilization is particularly detrimental to older adults, potentially leading to loss of muscle mass, venous thromboembolism, aspiration, respiratory complications, delirium, and pressure ulcers.96 prolonged use of a cervical collar can also lead to significant skin breakdown.97 within institutional limitations, prompt radiologic reporting of diagnostic imaging and early evaluation by surgical spine service if available and indicated should be advocated. in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients, east guidelines currently conditionally recommend c-spine collar removal and clearance after a negative high-quality c-spine ct scan.98 however, this recommendation is based on low-quality evidence, is not specific to older adults, and there is a pending update in progress. of note, standard cervical collar immobilization with a patient supine on a flat surface may not adequately put the spine in a neutral position in older adults. age-related thoracic kyphosis and cervical hyperlordosis means that lying flat without occipital cushioning can place the cervical spine in hyperextension.99 rib fractures rib fractures are diagnosed in approximately 35% of patients with blunt thoracic trauma and are present in 10% of all patients presenting to a trauma center.100,101 among older adults, rib fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 102–108 in this patient population, each additional broken rib is associated with a 19% relative increase in mortality.109 several studies have sought to identify a threshold number of rib fractures over which mortality significantly increases. although this number varies based on the study, what is clear is that the frequency of complications and mortality increases proportionally to the number of ribs fractured.105,110,111 given the implications on patient morbidity and mortality and hospital length of stay, appropriate investigation and management of rib fractures in older adults are critical. imaging is particularly important for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with blunt chest trauma. because plain radiographs miss up to 50% of rib fractures, ct scans should be considered given the higher incidence of intrathoracic injuries in older adults.112 optimized analgesia is the cornerstone of rib fracture management. inadequate analgesia from rib fractures contributes to patient morbidity including splinting, hypoventilation, and pneumonia; therefore, early pain management is crucial in older patients. multiple guidelines recommend the use of a multimodal analgesic approach using opioid and nonopioid adjuncts, including nerve blocks, to improve pain management and patient outcomes in patients with blunt thoracic trauma.34,113,114 multiple observational studies also demonstrate the utility of spirometry (typically forced vital capacity) to risk-stratify patients, and identify those that may benefit from closer observation in the icu.115–117 formalizing the approach to rib fracture management, including early assessment, risk stratification for icu care, analgesia, and other aspects of care in a clinical pathway or protocol has also been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality in geriatric trauma patients.114,118–120 one key trauma in the aging population 191 downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan university from clinicalkey.com/nursing by elsevier on april 18, 2025. for personal use only. no other uses without permission. copyright ©2025. elsevier inc. all rights reserved. aspect of this approach is the involvement of multidisciplinary teams, such as a pain service, respiratory therapy, and physical and occupational therapy.121 several risk stratification and management pathways exist. the western trauma association rib fracture algorithm suggests that any patient with two or more rib fractures older than the age of 65 be admitted to an icu or step-down unit. hip and pelvic fractures hip and pelvic fractures are one of the most common traumatic injuries among older adults.122 plain radiographs have an estimated sensitivity of 90% to 98% for hip fractures and should reveal most fractures.123 however, if there is persistent clinical suspicion despite normal radiographs (eg, pain, inability to ambulate), then further imaging should be pursued to rule out occult fracture. among patients with hip fractures, preoperative wait times greater than 24 hours are associated with increased complications and mortality.124,125 a recent randomized trial demonstrated that surgery within 6 hours of diagnosis resulted in a lower risk of delirium, better pain management, earlier mobilization, and earlier hospital discharge.126 these data suggest there should be prompt consultation or transfer to a facility with orthopedic surgery to help expedite surgical intervention if indicated. as with rib fractures, aggressive pain management is the mainstay of treatment while awaiting more definitive care or admission. the literature also supports the implementation of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach in geriatric hip fracture care.127–129 interdisciplinary teams could include geriatricians, physical and occupational therapists, and social workers. studies have shown that this team-based approach decreases morbidity and mortality, and optimizes discharge planning.129–134 for pelvic fractures, older adults are more likely to sustain lateral compression fractures and are at higher risk for bleeding and mortality, and therefore more likely to require transfusion and angiographic embolization.135,136 with potential previous comorbidities and anticoagulation therapy, clinicians should consider anticoagulation reversal and early interventional radiology consultation for consideration of angiographic embolization.137 there are no widely accepted criteria for angioembolization but the threshold should be lower in older adults.89 general indications include hemodynamic instability, ct showing pelvic hematoma or active contrast extravasation, and requirement for massive transfusion.89 soft tissue injuries with age, skin loses elastin and collagen, the epidermis becomes thin, and there is decreased subcutaneous support.138 older adults are therefore more prone to soft tissue injury and the wound healing process is prolonged. in the context of geriatric trauma, there are certain particular considerations. prolonged immobilization early trauma care is often associated with immobilization, including backboards, spine precautions, and cervical collars. patients can be immobilized for a prolonged period of time while they await evaluation, investigations, and diagnostic imaging.139 prolonged immobilization can lead to skin breakdown and development of pressure ulcers, which may develop in 4 to 6 hours.140 clinicians should be even more mindful of minimizing immobilization to prevent iatrogenic soft tissue injuries, especially in older adults, and consider using reactive gel surface mattresses to reduce pressure ulcer risk.141,142 192 lau et al downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at hong kong metropolitan

tears among older adults, skin tears have a significant risk of evolving into complex chronic wounds. the international skin tear advisory panel classifies skin tears into three types: type 1 has no skin loss, with a flap that can be repositioned; type 2 has partial skin loss, where the wound cannot be completed covered; and type 3 has total flap loss, where the entire wound bed is exposed.143 depending on the type and extent of injury, the involvement of a wound care nurse or even plastic surgeon may be advisable. best practice recommendations include cleansing with saline or clear tap water at a low pressure to remove clots and dried blood, debridement of nonviable tissue, and reapposition of any skin flap over the wound bed.144 given the fragility of the skin flaps, suturing and staples are not recommended.145 skin glue or adhesive strips (steri-strips) may be used to approximate the wound edges if the wound bed is appropriately covered by the flap. elder abuse elder abuse includes physical, psychological, sexual, and financial abuse, and neglect. although few studies have accurately captured the prevalence of elder abuse and neglect, a 2016 scoping review of international literature on elder abuse found a worldwide mean prevalence of 7%.146 another review of studies across 28 countries found that one in six older adults older than the age of 60 were subjected to some form of abuse.147 emergency physicians frequently miss and underreport elder abuse.148–150 in the context of geriatric trauma, clinicians should always maintain a high level of suspicion of elder abuse, especially if there is a delayed presentation, inconsistent history, and atypical injury patterns. risk factors for abuse include: problems with physical health; mental illness; substance use; functional, financial, social or emotional dependency; problems with stress and coping; previous abuse; interpersonal conflicts; and social isolation.151 although these risk factors are broad, the key takeaway is to be cognizant of potential nonaccidental trauma in older adult patients and to intervene as needed. the legal duty to report elder abuse and neglect depends on multiple factors, such as geographic location of residence, the patient’s place of residence (ie, care facility), and if a criminal act has occurred. health care providers should therefore inform themselves about their local laws relevant to elder abuse and legal obligations to report to the authorities. given the challenges in identifying elder abuse, adopting a team-based approach involving interdisciplinary health care professionals, including geriatric emergency nurses and social workers, is useful.152 there are also multiple screening tools that are available that could be used to help detect elder abuse, although there is no single tool that is considered to be the gold standard.153 the american college of surgeons best practice guideline suggests that providers consider screening older adults for elder abuse, and lays out the approach to doing so.154 overall, it is essential to maintain high suspicion for elder abuse in the context of geriatric trauma and to involve an interdisciplinary team for support if there are concerns. goals of care with increased morbidity and mortality in geriatric trauma, clinicians should promptly engage in goals of care discussions with the patient, their substitute decision maker, and their family. previous directives need to be noted by the treatment team and trauma in the aging population 193 downloaded for anonymous user

functional status. goals of care discussions should be approached with empathy and clarity.155 transitions to inpatient care delirium prevention delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome that is distressing to patients and is associated with serious adverse outcomes. it is essential to incorporate multicomponent nonpharmacologic delirium prevention strategies, such as optimizing the older patient’s environment (eg, having a clock and calendar, room with windows, placing familiar objects or pictures in hospital room) and addressing basic needs (eg, correct sensory impairments with glasses, hearing aids, addressing hunger and thirst). nonpharmacologic strategies have clearly been shown to reduce incidence of delirium compared with usual care (relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.46– 0.71).156 these interventions to prevent delirium must be implemented as soon as possible, starting in the emergency department. medication: right medication, right dose, right time careful management of medication is imperative in the care of older adults. accurately represcribing and adjusting medication is crucial to avoid potential adverse effects and withdrawal. for example, patients with parkinson disease require their medication to be administered on time to prevent freezing and hypokinesia. older adults are also more susceptible to adverse effects of opioid analgesics. clinicians need to approach medication prescription for geriatric trauma patients cautiously, considering their medical comorbidities and adjusting dosing as needed (eg, adjusted for age, kidney failure). the beers criteria is a published list of medications that highlight those that may not be the safest or most appropriate options for older adults and is a useful resource to review.157 geriatric consultation service providing optimal management of hospitalized geriatric trauma patients is often complex, and needs to balance the care of acute injuries with preinjury comorbidities, frailty, fall risk, postinjury complications, and social and functional issues. current guidelines support the implementation of a proactive geriatric consultation service, consisting of geriatric specialists who evaluate patients early in their admission, before the development of complications. assessment and management by a dedicated geriatric service is associated with decreases in the incidence of delirium, length of stay, discharge to long-term care facilities, and hospital-acquired complications (eg, functional decline and falls).158–160 summary older adults who experience trauma have unique needs compared with their younger counterparts. there are several specific considerations that a provider must take into account when involved in their care. recognition of illness severity based on different physiologic parameters, avoiding undertriage of patients, liberal use of diagnostic imaging, and involving multidisciplinary teams to optimize outcomes are all crucial. on an institutional level, leaders must ensure that care pathways are standardized and that trauma teams have specific training in geriatric trauma. 194 lau et al downloaded for anonymous user (n/a) at
