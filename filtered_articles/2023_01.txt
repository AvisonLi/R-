preface................................................................................................................................................... xv section 1 assessment of the health and functioning of the elderly this section encompasses matters related to the scales and instruments used in health that are fractured in the results presented by different authors due to their inappropriate use. chapter 1 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health..................................................... 1 heidi-tuulia eklund, university of jyväskylä, finland patrik eklund, umea university, sweden in this chapter the authors compare assessment techniques in education and health. these examples are drawn from assessment for learning in secondary school as compared with assessment of functioning in care of older people. content in these respective assessment environments is obviously quite different, but there is some overlap, in particular related to social circumstances. the authors further argue that the assessment structure and formal analysis techniques are and even should be quite similar. these two domains of assessments share not only a common information and terminological structure, but also a common assessment framework (caf) which is shown to be extendable by process detail. in this focus on assessment in health, particularly in active and healthy ageing, the model is intended to support the integration of information and processes (decision and intervention pathways) supporting various types of providers. chapter 2 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values........................................... 13 patrik eklund, umea university, sweden this chapter shows how assessment values often are viewed as part of a numeric scale, where in fact the fact values are understood more as symbolic in an ordinary scale. computing with numeric and symbolic values is different, and challenging in particular if and when computations have to be intertwined. computing with numeric values involves traditional applied and numerical mathematics, whereas computing with symbolic values involves logic and algebra. in this chapter the authors illuminate these aspects using examples from classification of functioning. ﻿ chapter 3 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults: a review based on upto- date knowledge................................................................................................................................ 21 vaitsa giannouli, aristotle university of thessaloniki, greece financial capacity and financial exploitation assessment in older adults is a topic of debate in modern societies, given the economic, medical, legal, and ethical implications. healthcare professionals, legal professionals, older individuals (healthy as well as patients suffering from neurocognitive disorders), family members/informal and/or formal caregivers, and the state are all involved in this complex process. this chapter explores the theoretical models on which relevant neuropsychological instruments have been proposed and are used in different cultural settings. in addition to that, factors that can predict financial capacity performance are presented and an attempt is made to propose relevant assessment protocols by taking into consideration up-to-to-date knowledge on this topic. chapter 4 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health................................................ 48 ana paula fontes, school of health, university of algarve, portugal anabela de magalhães ribeiro, school of health, university of algarve, portugal & university hospital center of algarve, portugal luís pedro ribeiro, school of health, university of algarve, portugal the studies about the functioning of the elderly play an important role on what the present knowledge of the demography in the world is. the conceptual aspects of functioning according to who and operated by the international classification of functioning (icf), have been insufficiently addressed concerning its adequate applicability in most countries, hindering the contributions of its operation. the icf operationalizes a new paradigm of the concepts of functionality/disability, but also in relation to the concepts of health/illness, quality of life and well-being; where social skills, personal skills and physical capacity are emphasized, in a multidirectional and dynamic way, where all its components interact equitably with each other. the authors reflect on the contributions that the icf can make to the organizational, legislative, and structural needs in terms of aging. section 2 health promotion and disease prevention: intervention and implications the importance of the education of the elderly is highlighted through an individual physical exercise program using everyday objects and equine-assisted therapy programs to promote wellbeing and prevent falls. chapter 5 the perma model of wellbeing: a comprehensive framework for enhancing reminiscence in the elderly.............................................................................................................................................. 71 aastha dhingra, sgt university, india waheeda khan, sgt university, india this chapter examines the effectiveness of the perma model of wellbeing in enhancing reminiscence in elderly individuals. reminiscence is a process of recollecting past experiences, events, and memories, and it is commonly used as a therapeutic intervention to promote wellbeing in the elderly. the perma model integrates positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment to enhance overall ﻿ wellbeing. this chapter focuses on how the model can promote reminiscence and improve psychological wellbeing, social connectedness, and reduce depression and anxiety. the perma model was chosen for its holistic approach and positive effects on the elderly population. it is important to incorporate the perma model in enhancing reminiscence and to promote positive aging and enhance quality of life. chapter 6 physical activity programs for older people: methodological approach and practical implications.82 gonçalo dias, polytechnic institute of coimbra, portugal rui sousa mendes, coimbra school of education, polytechnic institute of coimbra, portugal rodrigo mendes, university of coimbra, portugal cristiana lameira, polytechnic institute of coimbra, portugal luis pedro ribeiro, university of algarve, portugal to provide a physical activity (pa) program for older people, capable of offering lasting psychomotor benefits, it is necessary to prescribe exercises directed to their real needs. moreover, to improve the quality of life of ageing people, it is important to apply an appropriate pa methodology in terms of intensity, volume, frequency, and progression, minimizing the physiological aspects that may be affected, such as cardiorespiratory function, among others. this chapter’s main objective is to present a pa program for older people, which can be carried out with very simple materials and is accessible to any elderly person, being structured in three distinct phases. the first phase encompasses joint and organic mobilization. the second includes the fundamental part of the physical exercises and activities to be carried out. finally, the third “return to calm” part, where some stretching exercises are proposed, so that participants gradually recover from the positive effects of the pa session and reflect on it. chapter 7 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly: a scoping review............. 103 tânia martins gonçalves, school of health, university of algarve, portugal maria da conceição farinha, school of health, university of algarve, portugal cristina marques-vieira, nursing school, universidade católica portuguesa, portugal maria augusta ferreira, school of health, university of algarve, portugal maria adelaide paiva, school of health, university of algarve, portugal maria do céu neves, school of health, university of algarve, portugal considering the age-related physiological and pathological changes, it´s relevant to analyze the scientific production regarding the contributions of equine-assisted therapy (eat) to the health of elderly people (ep). this scoping review followed the jbi methodology, according to the pcc method. eat has had benefits in healthy ep: increasing trunk neuromuscular activation, balance, flexibility, agility, and coordination. in alzheimer’s and parkinson’s, it’s associated with an improvement in predictive fall risk factors. it´s also associated with reduced spasticity and improved mental well-being in ep with spinal cord injury. in arthritis, a decrease the intensity and frequency of pain and increase of range of motion. regarding mental health, eat increases psychological stability, social stimulation, relaxation, and the evocation of positive memories. in post-traumatic stress disorder, it can increase a sense of self-security. concomitantly, it may be associated with an improvement of ep memory. the integration of eat into therapeutic plans for ep should be considered by health professionals. ﻿ chapter 8 ambulatory wellbeing: perspectives on senescence in gerontology................................................. 116 catherine hayes, university of sunderland, uk being able to theoretically underpin the gerontology of ageing is a fundamental part of designing and constructing bespoke research and care interventions for the exploration of falls prevention in practice. within the context of home care and community-based settings, being able to integrate falls prevention into the integrated care that older people receive, their ambulation, health and wellbeing, and subsequently their longevity in senior years can be extended and sustained in terms of quality and satisfaction. this chapter contextualizes and frames falls and fall injuries as a societal challenge by deconstructing the characteristic physiological processes of senescence and identifying key areas for fundamental address in the prevention of falls ‘in situ.’ the chapter focus is predominantly aligned to those processes of natural senescence aligned with normal ageing processes, alongside those pathologies which constitute abnormal pathological processes, which occur more often in older adults as a consequence of these processes of senescence. chapter 9 preventing falls: emphasizing education to support older person active ageing........................... 137 marja äijö, savonia university of applied sciences, kuopio, finland amanda m. clifford, ageing research centre, health research institute, university of limerick, ireland irene o’byrne maguire, national treasury management agency, ireland falls can have harmful physical and psychosocial consequences that affect the activity, socialization, and quality of life of older adults. falls prevention education (fpe) is critical to prevent falls among older people. fpe is required for all key stakeholders, including older people health care professionals and students, as well as other professionals who work with or offer services for older people. this is especially important to ensure the quality of services in health care sector in home services, hospitals, and residential settings. the fpe contents are extensive and need to be tailored to who is being trained and where. fpe is important because it informs prevention and management, hence supports older people with and without injuries to have an active and healthy life. there is extensive evidence-based to support fpe and well-functioning educational models to use this work. fpe pay dividends for people, society, and the economy. ﻿ section 3 treatment, monitoring, and satisfaction of the elderly proposals for treatment and intervention in the elderly, ranging from illness to therapeutic adherence, not forgetting the factors that affect the satisfaction of individuals in the provision of healthcare with the monitorization of all the processes are explored. chapter 10 nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease: a scoping review................................................................................................................................... 157 tânia martins gonçalves, school of health, university of algarve, portugal maria da conceição farinha, school of health, university of algarve, portugal cristina marques-vieira, nursing school, universidade católica portuguesa, portugal maria augusta gomes alves ferreira, school of health, university of algarve, portugal maria adelaide paiva, school of health, university of algarve, portugal maria do céu neves, higher school of health, university of algarve, portugal the increase in average life expectancy, accompanied by medical and technological advances, translates into an increase in chronic diseases and a constant updating of therapeutic strategies whose success depends on patient compliance. this scoping review followed the jbi methodology, according to the pcc method, and the aim was to identify measures associated with nursing care that improve the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with a chronic disease. these nursing interventions include continuous monitoring and surveillance, in person or digitally, using videos, remote monitoring software, or teleconsultations; personalized therapeutic plans; skills training based on a model of information, motivation, and behavior; the explanation of the value and therapeutic intent of the care plan; cognitive behavioral therapy; and the continuous validation through the teach-back method. evidence shows the relevance of nursing intervention in the process of health education to the elderly person. chapter 11 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare: a cognitive ability testing guide.......... 170 aikaterini christogianni, loughborough university, uk neuropsychological testing is necessary to assess cognitive functions in individuals who exhibit signs of mild cognitive impairment (mci) and dementia. this chapter presents the most commonly used cognitive assessments for mci and dementia in healthcare and academia, including information about normative data, and cut-off scores. some of the tests presented are: the mini-mental state examination, trail making tests, montreal cognitive assessment, alzheimer’s disease assessment scale-cognitive, and clock drawing test. in addition, the chapter discusses the benefits of timely diagnosis and limitations in the testing assessments that might affect the quality of life in individuals with cognitive decline due to mci and dementia diagnosis. ﻿ chapter 12 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty: a study based on a classification and regression tree............................................... 192 ana paula fontes, university of algarve, portugal ana marreiros, university of algarve, portugal marina gueorguieva kovatchki, university of algarve, portugal nuno césar barbosa, vila franca de xira hospital, portugal daniel bernardino, vila franca de xira hospital, portugal acácio ramos, vila franca de xira hospital, portugal joão paulo sousa, algarve private hospital, portugal patient satisfaction has gained relevance in clinical practice, and knowing the variables with the greatest predictive power in this assessment is vital. the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between postoperative satisfaction of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (tka) and acquired functioning and to determine differences between sexes. this retrospective observational study included 183 patients undergoing tka between 2018–2021. functioning variables were pain, range of motion, gait distance, and womac domains. there were significant differences in gait distance, pain, and womac between the pre- and postoperative periods. women had worse scores in final evaluation moments, although satisfaction was similar between the sexes. satisfaction and the difference and the rate of change in womac were significantly correlated. in the classification and regression tree analysis, the variable that most differentiated satisfaction in women was the womac variation; in men, it was the pain variation rate. chapter 13 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare: a systematic literature review................... 211 hawa a. zanzeh, social organization, ghana luis pedro ribeiro, university of algarve, portugal anabela magalhães ribeiro, school of health, university of algarve, portugal & university hospital center of algarve, portugal helena almeida, university of algarve, portugal the study aimed to understand the measures of person-centered healthcare quality variables and how they affect patient satisfaction and responsiveness. to address the objective, the study adopted a systematic literature approach to review 20 related studies, selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the prisma flowchart, and analysed using thematic analysis. the study revealed several variables that included institutional factors, quality dimensions, and socioeconomic factors had a relationship with service quality in healthcare delivery which influences patients’ perception, care experiences, and the quality of services they receive. therefore, it is recommended that the management of hospitals consider these variables and socioeconomic factors like age, cultural beliefs, level of education, income, and occupation of patients to provide health personnel a better understanding of patients and treat them based on their specific needs when providing general services. chapter 14 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration......................................................... 231 joel guerreiro, universidade do algarve, portugal in the last few years, many advances in sensing usage have been developed, and their application on healthcare is substantially growing due to many factors, but the most important one is the patient’s physical parameters data gathering for remote monitorization and intervention. sensing and actuation ﻿ as a service using clouds as basis may provide a platform to directly connect the patient’s sensors to the health care providers and fast monitor or intervene in case of alarm, especially on elderly people. in portugal, all patient’s data is collected to a personal patient data register (health portal), that can be seen by any medical and technical health staff working on public institutions. this study aims to design a framework using sensing and actuation as a service on clouds able to provide data integration into the portuguese national patient data register and alarm triggering for fast medical intervention. section 4 elderly care differences and protection policies elderly care differences and protection policies through the promotion of outpatient care, health education, fundamental protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly, and the safeguarding of human dignity are explored. chapter 15 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia: different cultures, same goal................................ 249 carla piscarreta damásio, center for innovative care and health technology, school of health sciences, polytechnic of leiria, portugal gordana ristevska dimitrovska, higher medical school, university st. kliment ohridski bitola, north macedonia aging is a challenge for the whole of society and for all generations, involving issues related to intergenerational solidarity, but also to adapting to their new needs. the who has established guidelines for the care of the elderly. however, the realities and cultures of countries influence the provided care. it was in this sense that this chapter addresses: characterize the elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia; describe the elderly care contexts existing in portugal and in north macedonia; and reflect about the similarities and differences about elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia. despite the different realities, cultures, and policies of the two countries under study, the authors found that the elderly are cared for in different and distinct contexts, and there is a shortage of structural and human resources. chapter 16 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging............................. 284 carmen macedo, university of algarve, portugal this chapter aims to contribute to the deepening of scientific knowledge in the area of active and healthy aging, considering as fundamental the protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly and the safeguarding of human dignity, with a purpose to their effective implementation. in this perspective, on the one hand, we recognize that global and universal demographic aging is increasingly active and participatory in society. on the other hand, we assist in situations of profound vulnerability and risk, through the phenomenon of violence against the elderly, which implies their detection, prevention, investigation, and adoption of social policies and legislation. compilation of references................................................................................................................ 305 about the contributors..................................................................................................................... 363 index.................................................................................................................................................... 369 ﻿ preface today’s society gives importance to aging in the last decades of the individual’s life, which are usually those in which the health condition tends to deteriorate, and the set of chronic pathologies increases. action at this level is verified through the increased concern of government officials with the elderly population, motivated by the socio-economic impact of the costs associated with the provision of health care in this demographic group. the increase in longevity in most developed countries is seen as a result of a better quality of life during working years, however, the time gained doesn’t entail the same quality of life. therefore, it is important to understand how the quality of life can be enhanced as the population ages, and for that an adequate assessment process is necessary, providing the ability to intervene properly and without jeopardizing the whole of society (e.g., the overload of health services). with the correct assessment, it will be possible to plan and improve the way health services provide their users with a healthy aging. in the field of health assessments for an aging population, there is a need for an updated collection of original research. this book will aim to provide relevant theoretical frameworks and the latest empirical research findings in health assessments for an aging population. it was written for academics, researchers, and health professionals who want to improve their understanding of the aging process and work together to translate evidence-based research into interdisciplinary, easy-to-use tools. above all, improve the quality of life of those who age. the target audience of this book will be composed of researchers, practitioners, and students, working in the field of health sciences in various disciplines dedicated to improving the healthcare of older adults and quality of life, such as e.g. geriatric medicine, gerontological nursing, gerontological social work, gerontology, rehabilitation science, fall prevention, patient safety, social aspects of care, health economy, psychology, policy, law and older adults themselves and their caregivers. contains state-ofthe- art research, practices, and related practices and guidelines. this book is divided into four sections, with contents on “assessment of health and functioning of elderly” (four chapters), “health promotion and disease prevention: intervention and implications” (five chapters), “treatment, monitoring and satisfaction of the elderly” (five chapters), and the fourth and last section “elderly care differences and protection policies” (two chapters), for a total of 16 chapters that provide relevant theoretical and practical frameworks. the first section is composed of four chapters related to the assessment of health and functioning of elderly, it encompasses matters related to the scales and instruments used in health that are fractured in the results presented by different authors due to their inappropriate use. the first chapter is on “comparative framework for assessment in education and health.” this chapter compares assessment techniques in education and health. the examples provided are drawn xv preface from assessments made for learning in a secondary school as compared with assessments of functioning in the care of older people. according to the authors these two domains of assessment share not only a common information and terminological structure but also a common assessment framework which is shown to be extendable by process detail. in our focus on assessment in health, particularly in active and healthy ageing, our model is intended to support the integration of information and processes (decision and intervention pathways) supporting various types of providers. the second chapter is “health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values,” and covers aspects related to showing how the assessment values often are viewed as part of a numeric scale, whereas the fact values are understood more as symbolic in an ordinary scale. the author gives us a perspective of the challenge through examples from the classification of functioning. the third chapter is “neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults: a review based on up-to-date knowledge” and this chapter explores the theoretical models on which relevant neuropsychological instruments have been proposed and are in use in different cultural settings. in addition to that, factors that can predict financial capacity performance are presented and an attempt is made to propose relevant assessment protocols by taking into consideration up-to-to-date knowledge on this topic. the fourth chapter is “reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ” and reflects the conceptual aspects of functioning according to who and operated by the international classification of functioning and how insufficiently it has been applied to most countries because of its lack of adequacy. in the chapter, the authors reflect on the contributions that the international classification of functioning can make to organizational, legislative, and structural needs in terms of aging. the second section “health promotion and disease prevention: intervention and implications,” is composed of five chapters, where the importance of the education of the elderly is highlighted, through an individual physical exercise program using everyday objects, and equine-assisted therapy programs to promote wellbeing and prevent falls. the fifth chapter on “the perma model of wellbeing: a comprehensive framework for enhancing reminiscence in the elderly” focuses on how the model can promote reminiscence and improve psychological wellbeing, social connectedness, and reduce depression and anxiety. the perma model was chosen for its holistic approach and positive effects on the elderly population. it is important to incorporate the perma model in enhancing reminiscence, promoting positive aging and enhancing the quality of life. the sixth chapter is entitled “physical activity program for older people: methodological approach and practical implications” and the main objective is to present a pa program for older people, which can be carried out with very simple materials and accessible to any elderly person, being structured in three distinct phases. the first phase encompasses joint and organic mobilization. the 2nd: includes the fundamental part of the physical exercises and activities to be carried out. finally, the 3rd: “return to calm” part, where some stretching exercises are proposed, so that participants gradually recover from the positive effects of the pa session and reflect on it. the seventh chapter on “contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly: a scoping review” conducts the relevant scoping review on scientific production regarding the contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of elderly people. it followed the jbi methodology, according to the pcc method. equine-assisted therapy has shown benefits in healthy elderly people: increasing trunk neuromuscular activation, balance, flexibility, agility, and coordination. the eighth chapter on “ambulatory wellbeing: perspectives on senescence in gerontology ” contextualizes and frames falls and fall injuries as a societal challenge by deconstructing the characteristic xvi preface physiological processes of senescence and identifying key areas for fundamental address in the prevention of falls ‘in situ’. chapter focus is predominantly aligned to those processes of natural senescence aligned with normal ageing processes, alongside those pathologies which constitute abnormal pathological processes, which occur more often in older adults as a consequence of these processes of senescence. the ninth chapter on “prevent falls - emphasize education to support older person active ageing ” has its focus on falls prevention education (fpe) is critical to prevent falls among older people. fpe is required for all key stakeholders including older people health care professionals and students, as well as other professionals who work with or offer services for older people, which will provide dividends to all of society, through the health of the elderly and economic impact. the third section “treatment, monitoring and satisfaction of the elderly” is composed of five chapters with proposals for treatment and intervention in the elderly, ranging from illness to therapeutic adherence. not forgetting the factors that affect the satisfaction of individuals in the provision of health care with the monitorization of all the processes. the tenth chapter on ” nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease: a scoping review,” presents a scoping review following the jbi methodology, according to the pcc method and the aim was to identify measures associated with nursing care that improve the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with a chronic disease. these nursing interventions include continuous monitoring and surveillance, in person or digitally, using videos, remote monitoring software, or teleconsultations; personalized therapeutic plans; skills training based on a model of information, motivation, and behavior; the explanation of the value and therapeutic intent of the care plan; cognitive behavioral therapy; and the continuous validation through the teach-back method. in the eleventh chapter on “cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare: a cognitive ability testing guide,” the author provides us with the most used cognitive assessments for mild cognitive impairment (mci) and dementia in healthcare and academia, including information about normative data, and cut-off scores. the chapter discusses the benefits of timely diagnosis and limitations in the testing assessments that might affect the quality of life in individuals with cognitive decline due to mci and dementia diagnosis. the twelfth chapter on “association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty: a study based on a classification and regression tree,” presentes a retrospective study wherein the primary objective was to evaluate the relationship between postoperative satisfaction of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (tka) and acquired functioning and to determine differences between sexes. there were significant differences in gait distance, pain, and womac between the pre- and postoperative periods. women had worse scores in final evaluation moments, although satisfaction was similar between the sexes. the thirteenth chapter on “factors influencing patients’ satisfaction in healthcare: a systematic literature review” presents a systematic literature approach to understand the measures of personcentered healthcare quality variables and how they affect patient satisfaction and responsiveness. the study revealed some variables that included institutional factors, quality dimensions and socioeconomic factors that had a relationship with service quality in healthcare delivery which influences patients’ perception, care experiences and the quality of services they receive. the fourteenth chapter on “sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration” points out how the advances in sensing usage have been developed and how their application in health care is substantially growing due to many factors, but the most important one is the patient’s physical parameters, as data gathering can support remote monitorization and intervention. this study aims to design xvii preface a framework using sensing and actuation as a service on the cloud, able to provide data integration into the portuguese national patient data register and alarm triggering for fast medical intervention. the fourth and last section is composed of two chapters that approach “elderly care differences and protection policies,” through the promotion of outpatient care, health education, fundamental protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly, and the safeguarding of human dignity. the fiftheenth chapter on “elderly care in portugal and north macedonia - different cultures, same goal” reflects the similarities and differences between elderly care in portugal and north macedonia true a characterization of the elderly care provided in both countries and their contexts. the two countries under study have different realities, cultures, and policies. also, the authors found that the elderly are cared for in different and distinct contexts, and there is a shortage of structural and human resources. the sixteen and last chapter on “challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ” underlines the importance as fundamental the protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly and the safeguarding of human dignity, with a purpose to their effective implementation. this chapter gives expression to the situations of profound vulnerability and risk, through the phenomenon of violence against the elderly, which implies their detection, prevention, investigation and adoption of social policies and legislation. conclusion the book provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of health assessments for an aging population, and offers a comprehensive set of tools and strategies to help professionals in the field. it also provides an in-depth analysis of the challenges and opportunities that come with the aging population, and how to best address them. the book also offers a range of practical solutions to help professionals in the field to better understand the complexities of health assessments for an aging population. aging is a complex process that involves physical, psychological, and social changes. it is a global phenomenon that will continue to have a profound impact on healthcare systems around the world. as people age, they are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses, which require long-term care. the cost of providing care for these conditions is increasing, and the number of elderly people is expected to continue to rise in the coming years. in addition, the elderly often requires more complex care than younger patients. the challenge is to ensure that healthcare systems must become more efficient and effective to provide comprehensive, high-quality care that is tailored to the needs of older adults. this includes investing in preventative health measures, providing access to specialized services, and ensuring that healthcare providers are adequately trained to provide care for the elderly. aging is a global issue that requires a global perspective, and health is a major component of that perspective. luis vieira ribeiro school of health, university of algarve, portugal anabela magalhães ribeiro school of

drawn from assessment for learning in secondary school as compared with assessment of functioning in care of older people. content in these respective assessment environments is obviously quite different, but there is some overlap, in particular related to social circumstances. the authors further argue that the assessment structure and formal analysis techniques are and even should be quite similar. these two domains of assessments share not only a common information and terminological structure, but also a common assessment framework (caf) which is shown to be extendable by process detail. in this focus on assessment in health, particularly in active and healthy ageing, the model is intended to support the integration of information and processes (decision and intervention pathways) supporting various types of providers. introduction the common assessment framework1 (caf) is more ‘common’ as a general overview than a real ‘framework’ for integrating information and process structures. it is used in many european countries and regions for “self-assessment” to improve public organizations in particular in public administration like education and health. even if called a ‘framework’ and supposed to include assessment scales and similar quantifications and qualifications, caf per se does not embrace any formal or methodological a comparative framework for assessment in education and health heidi-tuulia eklund university of jyväskylä, finland patrik eklund https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3965-2834 umea university, sweden 2 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ approaches to formal process based framework or information structure and terminology based assessment. therefore, as a candidate for complying with an ontology or, more formally and computationally, a namespace of information, caf is structurally shallow. basically, caf is a framework torso without any specific assessment scales or structures to enable organization of data information into a framework a logically full-bodied namespace. in this chapter we provide caf with an enrichment where we view information and process as part of the framework, so that assessment can be structurally formalized within such a syntactically welldeveloped framework. in our focus on assessment in education, with particular views on assessment of learning, our model is intended, on the one hand, to support curriculum task forces within national boards of education, and, on the other hand, to provide assessment framework toolsets in order to support curriculum regional task forces in municipalities, thus ultimately supporting curriculum planning workgroups as well as teachers and teams as education providers. in education, perception and performance are expected to be observed and assessed within modules of particular syllabi of courses. in active and healthy ageing, assessment of functioning plays an important role. these modules are processes within which tokens and data objects carry data and information, in the end appearing in assessment scales and further used in overall quality assurance. these processes are further integrated as subprocesses in a general process in education and health, including feedback loops representing quality assurance on all levels from national education curricula and care guidelines through municipal and regional adaptations, all the way down to specific education syllabi and care practices as specified in detail for and within particular schools and points of care. in our focus on assessment in health, we present particular detail within assessment in active and healthy ageing as personalized as well as population based. personalized assessment relates to monitoring of functioning and health conditions of an individual as a basis for arriving at suitable prevention figure 1. overview of the caf model 3 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ and intervention. information structure and related ontology is then important basis within a common assessment framework for active and healthy ageing (cafaha) as a methodology and information structure for personalized health assessment. assessment in education ‘educational assessment’ refers to the set of methods and processes by which evidence about student learning is designed, collected, scored, analysed, and interpreted. (brown, 2017) we may view assessment scales for teaching and learning as related to performance and capabilities, and as based on scaling instruments respectively for activity, skill, inclusion, attitude and cerebration. activity subdivides into social and individual activity. attitude is individual, whereas inclusion is a social aspect. cerebration relates to mental and cognitive capacity, and is further related with intellection and mentation. circumstance and health are more of environmental factors, and family situations often interact with other subareas of assessment. figure 2. grouping of factors appearing in assessment of learning (eklund et al, 2014) 4 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ a generally accepted and comprehensive core set of assessment scales in education is, however, yet to be developed, i.e., the grouping depicted in fig. 2 is more of a placeholder for assessment instruments yet to be developed. our example education case is drawn from teaching history of classical music in secondary school, using process drama (eklund, 2015), and turning mozart’s biography and life story into a basic set of facts, underlying a basic script for a ‘life process’ or ‘milestones in life’, thus creating the drama fiction and a classroom drama about mozart’s life. the pilot course is history of classical music as presented at seventh grade, where in a specific part of it we used an eight hours block for a journey with wolfel in 18th europe, with mozart’s requiem being and excerpt from that journey. the teacher-in-role is basically that of the narrator, and students are 18th century characters, one of them obviously being wolfel. the subprocess outline (eklund et al, 2013) and structure is based on freytag’s technique of the drama (freytag, 1900), describing the process drama. the subprocess includes the following tasks: • improvisation and conflict – activating the students to rehearse and perform the dance of death (music: dies irae from mozart’s requiem). • complication and storytelling – facts of mozart’s life at the end of his life, where death is knocking at the door. • ceremonial action and climax with candles, red cloak and mozart’s death mask. activating the students to put mozart’s cloak and mask on the table. lighting up some candles. (music: lacrymosa from mozart’s requiem). • resolution and conversation with students: how did they feel during the process? what did they like? what did they not like? what did they learn about mozart and life in general in the eighteenth century? marking the moment. student activation is important, and is monitored using observation and assessment of student presence and receptivity. observation is based on formal logic language, and assessment is related to logical structures within that logic. in this view of drama as process, token flow within the process carries information from activities and events, and thereby student’s capacity and talent can be monitored. teachers’ perceptions of their own professional identity affect their ability and capacity to work, and further affects the ability and desire to cope with changes in their own teaching (mcconville et al, 2019). the practice of using drama methods is therefore related to a diversity of factors connected with the well-being of teachers at work. assessment of teaching as an assessment complement to assessment of learning is then comparable to assessment of care provision as complementing assessment of well-being of older people. ethical aspects will also come into play, as shown e.g. for ethics related assessment of care provision in nursing (frilund et al, 2013). use of drama pedagogy in teaching leads to a creative way of working, which is expected to motivate students and at the same time also strengthening teacher’s own relations to their work and working environments. working methods of drama also provide teachers with incentives for further training and lifelong learning (mcdonagh et al, 2017). 5 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ assessment in health assessment in health is challenging especially when ‘health & social’ need to be considered for provision of a holistic functioning view of an individual, particularly in the case of older persons, where multiple diseases and a complexity of functioning problems come into play when considering various forms of interventions. assessment scales for older persons functioning, e.g. as provided within comprehensive geriatric assessment, cga, (stuck et al, 1993) viewed as a combination of information content and structure, are poorly equipped with terminology, formalism and logical support. this eventually disables inclusion of knowledge, elicited from observations in assessment data, into guidelines not only within assessment of functioning of older people, but also more generally within municipal and regional decision-making concerning care of older persons. falls prevention, as part of cga as an assessment framework, is a good example of the need for “assessment-in-assessment”, where fall risk assessment should be part of a more general geriatric assessment in particular for the purpose of establishing functioning profiles. in comparison with assessment in education, assessment in health is quite well developed, even if consensus about how to use the diversity of assessment instruments in practice is yet to be reached within the care communities. figure 3. teaching subprocess (eklund, 2015) 6 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ caf in education a curriculum, and in particular as including specific and detailed syllabi for courses and modules included in the curriculum, is usually well understood and even perceived by teachers, but a more formal distinction between curriculum and syllabus is surprisingly rare. a curriculum is mostly an unstructured ‘set’ of courses, whereas a syllabus is a ‘ordered list’ (otherwise also unstructured) of particular objectives within a course. assessment or quality assurance for a curriculum is then not only a summation or summary of some specific assessments of related syllabi. criteria indicating when the student and how the teacher qualifications have been reached is handled only informally, providing only little and shallow information detail related to criteria, thereby not enabling more formal assessment of skill level and proficiency. a clear and formal distinction between the student and the teacher is also crucial, as the teacher adhers to executing the curriculum and syllabi, whereas the student complies with and is committed to the teaching and learning process as conducted and executed by the teacher. the teacher provides in teaching and the student perceives while learning, where both provision and perception is subject to quality assurance using various types of assessment. such an assessment framework must be based on carefully selected and well targeted criteria, which in turn are to be grounded in the objectives of the curriculum. the hierarchy and specificity of curricula varies between regions in respective countries, and even between municipals in respective regions. the shallow caf structure being ‘common’ reflects this situation. we recommend identifying national curricula as adopted in respective municipalities or regions, and as finalized in each school by their internal curriculum task forces. the particular example drawn in this chapter has its focus on music teaching in secondary school using drama process as a teaching and learning methodology (eklund et al, 2013), and the process as being encoded in fig. 5 adopting the use of bpmn (business process modelling notation). figure 4. fall risk assessment connected with geriatric assessment (eip aha, action group a2) 7 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ process drama (bolton, 1979) is mostly seen as a particular methodology for teaching and learning, but it also embraces teaching as a process and tool. the teaching process thereby develops towards adopting drama process methodology and drama based teaching. (heathcote et al, 1995). our focus is on assessment of learning, rather than for learning or as learning. assessment of learning is logically and numerically qualified and quantified, and also communicated between curriculum task forces, and for which we have proposed a formal logic based methodology for quality assurance of learning and teaching, including a formal framework for integration of specific assessment scales to support quality assurance. (eklund et al, 2014) key performance results within caf cannot be specifically calculated, unless a proper set of assessment scales has been installed into some monitoring process related to education. student and teacher oriented observations related to activity and skill need to be complemented with assessment of inclusion, attitude and cerebration. caf does not cover detail related to such assessments. the relation between educational and health assessment is additionally important. educational assessment differs from health assessment basically only in content, but the information structures and decision procedures use similar logic languages and underlying algebraic structures for aggregation of qualitative and quantitative data. figure 5. ‘teachers & teams subprocess’ in the overall education quality assurance process (eklund et al, 2013) 8 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ caf in health personalized assessment of functioning and health within active and healthy ageing also involves whowhere- what-why-how. various types of professionals (who) are multi-acting, also with informal carers, and are involved at various locations (where), both as locations and forms of living as well as points-of-care. assessment content (what) and its granularity as data and information structure involves (at least) social and health data as related to functioning, typically using who’s (world health organization) international classification of functioning, disability and health (icf), assessment scales in old age psychiatry (burns et al, 2009), and comprehensive geriatric assessment (cga) (stuck et al, 1993). the information and process structure of who-where-what builds upon particular strategies and objectives (why). good practices (how) together with specific recommendations and guidelines are then subject to evaluation. figure 7. drama process within caf figure 6. assessment of learning within caf 9 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ in health, as compared to process view in education, similar bpmn models have been developed for falls prevention (eklund, 2021). information structure representation of nomenclatures and classifications is provided by who’s family of international classifications (who-fic). the reference classifications icd (diseases) and icf (functioning) appear potentially in a structured relation with each other. the information entities in icf are inherently multivalent, and classifications recognize this multivalence through introduction of its generic scale. this, in turn, requires the formal management of many-valuedness and uncertainty in a logical setting (eklund, 2016). icf is specific concerning uncertainties related to truth values. icf comes with a 5-scale, so that e.g. “energy level (b1300)” is not just a matter of yes/no, but graded in a way that can also be see as logical truth degrees: xxx.0 no problem xxx.1 mild problem xxx.2 moderate problem xxx.3 severe problem xxx.4 complete problem xxx.8 not specified xxx.9 not applicable the degrees xxx.0 to xxx.4 can be seen as an ordered set of truth degrees including five points, where ‘xxx.0’ is logically ‘true’ and ‘xxx.4’ is logically ’false’. this binding should not be done at a syntactic figure 8. observe-assess-decide (oad) teams providing falls prevention and mitigation 10 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ level, but rather to be considered on a semantic level. there is also a distinction to be made between ‘xxx.8 not specified’ and ‘xxx.9 not applicable’, the former basically saying that a truth degree has yet not been provided, and the latter basically saying that the typing of the factor is not applicable. if ’not specified’ is represented by the unital ‘e’ in a quantale, a special type of an algebraic structure (eklund et al, 2018), with 6-valued set {e,f,a,b,c,t} of truth values, corresponding respectively to the icf valuations {xxx8, xxx4, xxx3, xxx2, xxx1, xxx0}, then a first observation is that the unital can appear in different relations with respect to the other values. (eklund, 2021) here it should be noted that a 6-valued unital quantale is not unique, an therefore the particular choice of the quantale should be carefully selected and related to the health and social care domain where it is applied. for examples of quantales used with icf data, see (eklund, 2021). the following provides the basic listing for an example of a icf core set for social assessment: subgroups obtain their valuations given an aggregation of valuations of items in subgroups, so that e.g. the valuation of activity is the aggregation of valuations respectively of b1300 and b1301. if b1300 is ‘no problem’ and b1301 also is ‘no problem’ we obviously expect activity to be ‘no problem’. the aggregation of other combinations depends on the choice of the underlying unital quantale. conclusion assessment in education and health is comparable in that they share a common assessment framework and information structure. education and teaching pathways and processes are further designed similarly as compared to pathways and processes describing good practices in care environments. table 1.subgroup icf activity b1300, b1301 capability b1266, b1400, b1601 inclusion b1261, b1262, b1264, d9108, d9205 attitude e425, e465 mood b1522 circumstance e5700, e5750 family e310, e320 11 a comparative framework for assessment in education and health ﻿ references bolton, g. m.

part of a numeric scale, where in fact the fact values are understood more as symbolic in an ordinary scale. computing with numeric and symbolic values is different, and challenging in particular if and when computations have to be intertwined. computing with numeric values involves traditional applied and numerical mathematics, whereas computing with symbolic values involves logic and algebra. in this chapter the authors illuminate these aspects using examples from classification of functioning. introduction in this chapter we point out the importance not to mistreat symbolic values in assessments as numeric values. it is common in likert like scales to understand the ordinal scale as a sequence of numbers, so that a 5-scale is represented by the numbers {0,1,2,3,4} or {1,2,3,4,5}, and computing with the values in the scale becomes computing with numbers. doing so ignores the logical nature of such a scale, where the extreme values represent good/bad or true/falls, and values in between represent levels of uncertainty with respect to the extreme values. a typical finite and ordinal scale is provided within icf (international classification of functioning, disability and health), as part of who-fic (world health organization - family of international classification) classifications), which involves computing with its generic 5-scale of values. we will show how a logical-algebraic approach to computing with these values is done utilizing algebraic structures represented by quantales. we will also show how the 6th and 7th values annotated with icf’s core 5-scale can be integrated into the computations. those additional 6th and 7th values enable us to compute with health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values patrik eklund https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3965-2834 umea university, sweden 14 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values ﻿ missing and incomplete data. conventional data analysis using numerical and statistical methods is unable to handle missing data in these ways. the who family of international classifications and terminologies includes the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (icd), the international classification of functioning, disability and health (icf), and the international classification of health interventions (ichi). these are the so called reference classifications that “serve as the global standards for health data, clinical documentation and statistical aggregation”. apart from the reference classifications, there are other classifications including international classification of diseases for oncology, international classification of primary care, international classification of external causes of injury (iceci), technical aids for persons with disabilities, the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system with defined daily doses (atc/ddd),international classification for nursing practice (icnp), verbal autopsy standards: ascertaining and attributing causes of death tool, and the startup mortality list (icd-10-smol). for icf (icf, 2001) there is the main english version and additionally there are translations to a number of languages, and more translations are desired. icf was officially endorsed by all 191 who member states in the fifty-fourth world health assembly on 22 may 2001 as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability. items in the four components of icf are arranged in a hierarchical structure, where items appear under sections, sections under chapters, and chapters within components. component chapters sections items some items further subdivide into subitems. there are four components, the first of which is ‘body functions’. here is an example of items in a section in a chapter: body functions body structures activities and participation environmental factors chapter 3 support and relationships global

the numbers 0 to 4 to compute with them is not advisable. clearly, complete can in some sense be seen as “more than” severe, as 4 is more than 3, but transforming the set l= {no, mild, moderate, severe, complete} to the set of digits, as symbols, n4= {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} will immediately, and unfortunately, invite to computing with these digits as numbers. this then adds unintended and undesirable semantics to the members in l. in fact, adding n4 makes l come with a companion function f: l → n4 where f(no)=0, …, f(complete)=4. note also how we do not necessarily need to arrange it like f(complete)=0, …, f(no)=4 the reverse, f(no)=-, …,f(complete)=4 is often preferred. these distinctions are not explicitly written or recommended in icf manuals. mapping xxx.0 to the value 0 and xxx.4 to the value 4 is often adopted, but nowhere is it written or recommended in icf that it may be useful to consider such options. on computing with these values, it is immediately clear that commutativity cannot be axiomatized. for an operator *: l×l→l, it cannot be assume or required e.g. that mild*moderate = moderate*mild the advantage of using quantales is that all values, including the 6th and 7th values from icf’s generic scale, can be used by the operators. for example, we may include `xxx.8 not specified’ as a 6th element to arrive a 6-point lattice, and use that element as a “missing value” or a value “not (yet) known” value. then we need to decide where, in relation to the 5-chain, this 6th element “not known” will be placed, and further, how to compute with that value in the selected 6-point complete lattice (one of 15 lattices) with underlying set 16 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values ﻿ {no, mild, moderate, severe, complete, notknown} of elements in the lattice. finite lattices for n=2 and n=3, the 2-chain and 3-chain are the only lattices for 2-point and 3-point sets, not considering the possibility of turning them upside down. for n=4, the 4-chain and the `diamond’ are the only possible lattices. for n=5, there are 5 lattices. figure 1. 4-point “diamond” lattice figure 2. all 5 lattices for a 5-point set 17 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values ﻿ for n=6, there are 15 lattices. from application point of view, useful lattices are those possessing a subchain of 5 elements, where one element, the “not known” is “sidelined” to that chain. for example, in lattice (9), among the 6-point lattices, the sidelined element 1 is below the top element and above the bottom element but unordered or unrelated to all other elements. lattice (11) is similar, but then elements 2 or 3 are unordered with respect to each other. lattices (2) and (5) have sideline elements that are in a “more optimistic way” ordered with respect to the other elements. for instance, in lattice (2), elements 2 and 3 would correspond to mild and moderate, respectively, so by default, the missing value, the sidelined element 1, is worse than no (problem) but better that severe (problem). lattice (13) has `not (yet) known’ as “optimistically” sidelined with the generic 5-scale. quantales a quantale (x,*,,,,t) is a semigroup (x,*) and a complete lattice (x,,,,t) fulfilling the condition that the semigroup operation is join-preserving in both variables, i.e., the following condition is fulfilled: x v a v x a a a x a a x * *     ( ) = ( ) v a x v a x aax aax ( )* = ( * ) for all x∈x and all a í x . figure 3. all 15 lattices for a 6-point set 18 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values ﻿ note the convention  = , which means that x *= *x = for all x∈x. in some applications this condition may be too restrictive. note that a distributive lattice is a quantale with the join as the semigroup operation. however, this is a very special kind of a quantale. there are two quantales on a 2-pointed set, 12 quantales on a 3-pointed sets, 129 quantales on a 4-pointed set, 1852 quantales on a 5-pointed set, and 33391 quantales on a 6-pointed set. fig. 5 shows the number of quantales per lattice in the case of the 6-point lattices. a unital quantale (x,*,e,,,,t) is a quantale where (x,*,e) is a monoid, and where the unit c satisfies x*c = e*x = x for all x∈x. in applications, unital quantales are useful when the sidelined elements are viewed as units. there are 2 830 quantales for the 6-point lattice (13), 57 of which are unital with the sidelined ‘not known’ as the unit. we then have x*notknown = notknown*x = x figure 4. not yet known modelled as an optimistic value 19 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values ﻿ for all values x in the generic 5-scale, i.e., computing with unknown values does not affect the overall computation. one of the 57 semigroups as unital quantales is shown in fig. 6. note how this particular semigroup operation in the quantale is non-commutative. indeed, we have severe*mild = complet whereas mild*severe = severe the catalogue of quantales (shamsgovara et al, 2019) contains a complete listing of all quantales up to 6 elements. figure 5. quantales distributed over lattices figure 6. quantale nr 6.13.1160 (shamsgovara et al, 2019) 20 health and functioning assessment with numeric and symbolic values ﻿ for more detail on the theory of quantales, including modules, see (eklund et al, 2018). for more detail on many-valued expressions, see see (eklund et al, 2014). recent work (shamsgovara, 2023) provides a listing of all quantales up to 9 elements, including further detail on a range of quantale properties. conclusion applicability of quantales, in this paper shown in the context of icf’s qualifiers, is not to be seen as generic. applications are often `in casu’. for example, when the unit in a unital quantale represents “not yet known” or “(still) missing”, or something similar, not being known in relation to other elements in the lattice. it must be further defined. in some case a not known value may be neutral in the sense of nothing being said about its relation to the other elements. in other cases, a default like a missing value being viewed as not necessarily bad or not necessarily good is sometimes desirable. in any case, the context will decide how that unknown a priori is to be related to the other elements. such considerations are important in handling uncertainty for functioning in icf. apart from the applicability of quantales for the generic scale in icf, quantales can be used similarly e.g. for likert type scales, or discretization (categorization) of visual analogue scales. in all these ordinal scales, the ability to compute with missing data is an advantage. references eklund, p.,

2019; 2020). the growing number of people over 65, raises a dire need for active aging and a need for a life plan for the life span (giannouli, 2016) in order to increase quality of life during the aging process (world health organization, 2002). although the process of normal aging in general has an effect on basic cognitive functions, this effect is continuously changing over time, thus recognizing and responding to changes in capacity through periodic reassessment/systematic identification longitudinally should be a priority for healthcare professionals. in contrast, individuals with mental, psychiatric and/or physical disorders, may present with deterioration or improvement of cognition (due to changes in severity and nature of symptoms), while neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults: a review based on up-to-date knowledge vaitsa giannouli aristotle university of thessaloniki, greece 22 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ others such as those with intellectual disabilities typically show a more stable pattern of marked deficits not fluctuating over time (giannouli, 2022a). overall memory, attention, executive functions, problemsolving, language, as well as sensory and perceptual capacities may diminish in older adults (anderson, 2008; glisky, 2007; lezak et al., 2004). the u.s. social security administration (ssa) defines financial capability as ‹‹a beneficiary’s ability to manage or direct the management of his or her benefits›› (national academies of sciences engineering and medicine, 2016) encompassing also ‹‹access to financial services, behavioral factors, social influences, and emotions›› (collins, 2013). regarding the evaluation of financial capability, there is a distinction between financial competence and financial performance. financial performance is defined as ‹‹an individual’s degree of success in handling financial demands in the context of the stresses, supports, contextual cues, and resources in his/her actual environment›› thus emphasizing the real-world functioning, while financial competence refers to ‹‹the financial skills one possesses, as demonstrated through financial declarative and procedural knowledge (financial literacy) as well as financial judgment (understanding, reasoning, and appreciation), typically assessed in a controlled (e.g., office or other clinical) setting›› (national academies of sciences engineering and medicine, 2016). financial competence has been also defined as ‹‹the capacity to manage money and financial assets in ways that meet a person‘s needs and which are consistent with his/her values and self-interest›› (lichtenberg, qualls, & smyer, 2015). financial capacity is also defined as ‹‹a range of conceptual, procedural, and judgment skills›› (sherod et al., 2009), thus, the terms financial capacity and financial competence can be treated as interchangeable (marson et al., 2013; sherod et al., 2009) and of pivotal importance in the neuropsychological assessment of the aging population (national academies of sciences engineering and medicine, 2016). although, there is a plethora of findings supporting that objective cognitive changes do relate to changes in financial skills (widera et al., 2011), a few studies (except for the u.s.) investigate the management of one’s finances, a very important instrumental activity of daily living (iadl) in older adults with or without neurocognitive disorders. nevertheless, direct influences of brain pathology have been supported, and more specifically underlying brain differences in regions involved in socio-emotional functioning (spreng et al., 2017), as well as changes in left angular gyrus and amygdala have been supported (giannouli & tsolaki, 2019a; griffith et al., 2010; nowrangi et al., 2022; stoeckel et al., 2013) along with the well-known frontal lobe lesions linkage to poorer performance in financial planning (goel et al., 1995). also, metabolic abnormalities of posterior cortical paralimbic regions are correlated to the degradation of financial abilities in mild alzheimer’s disease (ad) (griffith et al., 2007). for ad patients of all stages (mild, moderate, severe) (giannouli, stamovlasis & tsolaki, 2018; giannouli & tsolaki, 2021a; martin et al., 2008), and preclinical ad (marson, 2015), noticeable financial capacity deficits are found even in the most basic financial activities based on the severity of the cognitive deficits (giannouli, stamovlasis & tsolaki, 2018; martin et al., 2008). the same holds true for parkinson’s disease with dementia (pdd) (giannouli & tsolaki, 2019b; giannouli & tsolaki, 2021b; martin et al., 2013), frontotemporal dementia (giannouli et al., 2018; giannouli & tsolaki, 2021b; gill et al., 2019), dementia with lewy bodies (giannouli & tsolaki, 2016), vascular dementia (giannouli & tsolaki, 2021c) and mixed dementia (giannouli & tsolaki, 2023a). financial capacity deficits are also found in mild cognitive impairment (mci) both amenstic and non amnestic (giannouli & tsolaki, 2021d; griffith et al., 2003; triebel et al., 2009; 2010). it is of interest that in mci patients, deficits in cognitive domains such as attention and executive functioning have an influence on financial conceptual knowledge, bank statement management, and bill payment (okonkwo et al., 2006), while more time is 23 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ needed to complete financial tasks in patients compared to healthy controls (giannouli, stamovlasis, & tsolaki, 2018). degraded financial skills are also found in cognitively-impaired patients with multiple sclerosis, but their deficits are linked mainly to executive function and working memory deficits (tracy et al., 2017). in younger individuals, deficits are found in patients with schizophrenia (niekawa et al., 2007), bipolar disorder (richardson, jansen, & fitch, 2018), and traumatic brain injury (dreer et al., 2012). nevertheless, attitudes and decisions made not only by laypeople, but also by healthcare and legal experts towards financial capacity in older adults and older patients is highly impacted not only by objective measurements and diagnoses, but also by social and cultural factors that are reflected on beliefs and biases held regarding independence, protection and law (giannouli, 2014; giannouli et al., 2019). the objectives of this chapter are three: 1) to present the theoretical-psychological models of financial capacity assessment in old age, 2) to indentify the state-of-the-art regarding neuropsychological tools that are in use in different countries and cultural contexts, and 3) to propose neuropsychological assessment protocols that include all relevant factors that may have an impact on financial capacity. theoretical models of financial capacity and financial exploitation in old age financial capacity is a medico–legal construct representing an individual’s ability to independently manage his/her own financial affairs in a manner that is consistent with personal self-interest and values (marson et al., 2012). financial capacity is considered as multidimensional, given that it involves a broad range of conceptual, pragmatic, and judgment abilities/skills across various everyday settings (darzins, molloy, & strang, 2004; marson, 2013; sherod et al., 2009), and as a result different aspects of financial capacity/competence can be examined separately (grisso, 1986; 2003). among the many proposed models, some highlight the importance of real-world applications (national academies of sciences engineering and medicine, 2016) and the independence of the elderly patients (marson et al., 2000; national academies of sciences engineering and medicine, 2016), while other proposed models emphasize the need to examine the decision-making abilities as a fundamental skill at the basis of financial capacity (lai et al., 2008; lichtenberg et al., 2015). although a naïf approach in the past was based solely on arithmetic/numerical/mathematical skills for defining the psychological construct of financial capacity, a widely mentioned approach is based on a conceptual model which includes three different levels, namely specific financial abilities (tasks), main financial abilities (domains), and global financial ability (addition of the previous two) (marson, 2010; 2016). this model groups these activities into two basic dimensions performance (e.g. counting coins, paying bills) and judgment (e.g. make investments, choose the better offer). this can be defined as a clearly cognitive approach, considering individuals to be just the sum of their cognitive abilities, something that is not correct (lichtenberg, 2015), with an overemphasis on scores about deficits, rather than on the strengths, and with the person’s subjective experience remaining largely unexplored (mast, 2011). another approach that attempts to fill in these gaps, has been proposed by lichtenberg et al. (2016) in the field of financial capacity and financial exploitation. it is focusing on ‹‹the older adult’s decisionmaking process as it applies to a single financial decision the individual is considering (as opposed to a hypothetical scenario, which has traditionally been used to assess financial competency)›› (lichtenberg et al., 2016). this is a person-centered approach that supports autonomy by spotting and building on the individual’s strengths, while honoring his/her subjective values, preferences, and choices (fazio, 2013). 24 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ additionally, it emphasizes on the decisional abilities by assessing the older adult’s understanding of the actual financial decision that is in question, with the requirement that the older adult can communicate four fundamentally important elements of his/her decision, such as choice, understanding, appreciation, and reasoning (american bar association commission on law and aging & american psychological association, 2005; appelbaum & grisso, 1988; lichtenberg et al., 2016). neuropsychological instruments for the assessment of financial capacity and financial exploitation standardized classic neuropsychological tests (measuring basic cognitive domains such as memory, language, executive functions, etc.) are used in order to increase the reliability of the competence evaluation procedures, but their ecological validity is not ensured, as they may not always predict directly everyday functioning (american bar association commission on law and aging and american psychological association, 2008). as a result, the neuropsychological assessment procedures must be enriched with other evaluation procedures, including global functional assessment and specific capacity evaluation procedures regarding a specific legal question (moye, 1996; streisand & spar, 2008; wood, 2007). financial capacity and financial exploitation instruments are psychometric tools that are used in order to evaluate financial decisional capacity (drima, 2022). these instruments are designed to provide with the minimum amount of inferences specific and direct answers to legal and clinical questions compared to the classic neuropsychological tools measuring cognitive domains that are hypothesized to be predict financial capacity (archer, stredny, & zoby, 2006; grisso, 2003). although there is a plethora of relevant neuropsychological tests that are in use in different countries, specifically targeting the older population, four issues are of interest in the selection of these tests; a) the need for trained personnel regarding the administration and scoring of the results, b) the easiness of administration, c) the standardization (which is usually lacking for large sample sizes) and for different subgroups of older patients and healthy older adults in different socio-cultural settings, and d) the interpretation of the results of the evaluation made in different settings (e.g. daily geriatric clinics, care centers, courts etc.) with an emphasis not only on diagnostics, but also on relevant interventions. several instruments have been proposed aiming specifically at financial capacity and financial exploitation, which are considered to be two interconnected constructs, as the individuals who are characterized as partially capable or incapable (e.g. mci,, pdd, and ad patients) are at higher risk of financial exploitation as well (giannouli & tsolaki, 2019b; griffith et al., 2003; marson, 2013; marson et al., 2000). it is also of interest that there exist functional assessment instruments, that are already in use in europe and u.s., that include items relevant to financial abilities. for example, they may be measuring directly arithmetic functions in financial contexts, such as the two standardized financial arithmetic tasks from the clinical dementia rating interview (cdr) which are presented orally (“how many 5 cent coins make up 1€?” and “how many 50 cent coins make up 15.50€?”) with answers obtained in a verbal open response format assessed based on correctness (morris, 1993). these two questions from cdr have been used in germany in financial capacity assessments (loenneker et al., 2021). in addition to that, the commonly used mini-mental state examination (mmse) (folstein & folstein, 1975) as well as the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) (nasreddine et al., 2005), both include one item of subtraction of serial sevens (serial 100-7s subtraction), which has been found to best predict financial capacity when measured with an additional specific financial capacity test in greece (giannouli 25 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ & tsolaki, 2022d). the functional cognitive assessment scale (fucas), which is a cognitive-behavioral scale that assesses executive function in daily life activities directly in patients with dementia in greece (kounti et al., 2006), although it has been used as a screening tool for dementia, since it examines executive functioning in daily life activities, it also evaluates the execution of six daily-life activities [medication taking, financial management (shopping), clothing, washing, orientation, and communication] that are deemed crucial for the safe and independent life of older individuals and it also evaluates cognitive capabilities (problem comprehension, information processing in working memory, and planning) and four parameters of executive function: time distribution between the steps required, sequence of steps, accuracy of steps, and completeness of the activity (kounti et al., 2006). in italy, the numerical activities of daily living - financial (nadl-f) has been recently introduced with domains such as counting currencies, reading abilities, item purchase, percentages, financial concepts, bill payments, and financial judgments (arcara et al., 2019). one of the major drawbacks of this instrument is the small sample size of the participants and the overemphasis on mental calculations, that renders this instrument appropriate for detecting deficits mainly in mathematical abilities. wais-iv arithmetic subtest (as well as wais’s previous versions of arithmetic subtest) have been also used across the world as intelligence tests have norms coming from large and diverse populations and in this way they can serve psychological assessment with comparable results for the individual’s performance. in experimental research, tests such as the iowa gambling task, which requires simple financial choices has also been used (bechara et al., 1994). finally, functional assessment scales among which the widely used in europe, lawton – brody instrumental activities of daily living scale (iadl) includes a general item on how individuals handle finances with three corresponding levels, namely: 1) managing financial matters independently (e.g. budgets, writing checks, paying rent, bills, going to bank) by collecting and keeping track of income, 2) managing day-to-day purchases, but in need of help with banking, major purchases, or other activities, and 3) as being incapable of handling money (lawton & brody, 1969). thus the above tests can be also used for obtaining relevant information from the older individuals themselves or by asking family members, although the primary aim of these tests is not the complex constructs of financial capacity/exploitation. another point that needs to be raised here in contrast to the abovementioned classic neuropsychological tests, is that most of the instruments used in forensic settings that aim specifically financial capacity/exploitation were created, validated, and standardized in the u.s. (heilbronner, 2004; heilbrun et al., 2003), thus not permitting cross-cultural comparisons and generalization of results in broader non english-speaking settings. research articles indexed in pubmed and google scholar were searched by the end of october 2022, in order to find relevant financial capacity and financial exploitation instruments with the following terms-keywords: “financial capacity”, “financial competence”, “financial abilities”, “financial assessment”, “financial management”, “financial skills”, “financial exploitation”, and terms focusing on the age group of older adults: “aged” or “older adults” or “elderly” or “elders” or “mild cognitive impairment” or “alzheimer disease” or “dementia” or “neurocognitive disorder”. the articles that were included referred to abstracts and full articles published in english, regardless of the nationality of the older populations under study, in an attempt to search available instruments coming from different countries that examined different aspects of financial capacity, such as the ability to manage finances, the ability to make informed financial decisions, as well as the ability to avoid financial exploitation. the following instruments were found and are presented in alphabetical order. 26 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ the administration times are not reported as there is no such information for all the included instruments, and times of completion greatly vary in older persons with different neurocognitive diagnoses. assessment of capacity for everyday decision-making (aced) aced is a clinician-rated structured questionnaire used in the u.s., which consists of 7 items, designed to assist clinicians in evaluating older adults’ everyday decision-making capacity. although initially developed for assessing decisions regarding medial management, a specific version of the aced questionnaire can be tailored to assess financial management-judgment (understanding, appreciation, reasoning, expression of a choice) (lai & karlawish, 2007; lai et al., 2008). clinician assessment of financial incapability (cafi) cafi consists of 32 items in a structured questionnaire rated by a clinician and examines financial performance and financial judgment through spending, bill paying, management of funds, psychiatric symptoms, and ability to avoid financial victimization (black et al., 2014). in cafi the clinician(s) are asked to rate how well the individual has been meeting his/her basic needs, but this is done by the clinician and it is not based on direct observation of the individual. data come only from u.s. where the questionnaire was developed and administered. financial assessment and capacity test (fact) fact was developed in canada and aims at assessing several diverse domains-areas of specific difficulty such as memory, reading, writing ability, calculation, daily financial tasks, general financial knowledge, understanding assets, financial insight, financial confidence, and rational beliefs about money (black et al., 2007). fact’s results are targeting at the development of intervention strategies tailored to the functional needs of the older person by taking into consideration the four competence areas as proposed by appelbaum and grisso (1988), namely understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expressing a choice. three categorizations of total performance exist: “financially competent”, “financially incompetent,” and “individuals with marginal financial capacity” (black et al., 2007). financial capacity instrument (fci) and financial capacity instrument short form (fci-sf) fci is one of the most widely used instruments (based on the number of relevant publications that use it or are based on its theoretical framework). it contains 9 domains relevant to financial cognition and behavior, namely basic monetary skills, financial conceptual knowledge, cash transactions, checkbook management, bank statement management, financial judgment, bill payment, knowledge of assets/estate, and investment decision-making (griffith et al., 2003; marson et al., 2000; marson, 2016). in basic monetary skills, which is considered to be the only simple domain of fci, individuals have to identify coins and operate currency. in financial conceptual knowledge, individuals define simple financial concepts. in cash transactions, individuals indentify the costs at grocery store with transactions regarding one to three items. in checkbook management, a transaction paid by check is performed. in bank statement management, the individual identifies transactions on a bank statement. in bill payment, the individual 27 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ explains the meaning and purpose of bills. in knowledge of personal assets, the individual explains estate and investments, and in investment decisions, the understanding of the individual and making of decisions is examined based on the output of his/her response. fci classifies (older) individuals as capable, marginally capable, or incapable based on cut-off scores for the american older population. fci examines directly the financial performance of the individual, and a brief form has been also proposed for the american older adult population, that is financial capacity instrument short form (fci-sf) (gerstenecker et al., 2015). financial competence assessment inventory (fcai) fcai consists of 6 subscales (daily financial skills, financial discernment, wealth management, financial skills related to cognitive functioning, debt management, support sources), which are evaluated both as observed performance in tasks and with self-reports, while for some items information can also be collected regarding understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expressing a choice. although it has originally been used in australia (kershaw & webber, 2008; pachana et al., 2014), there are no proposed cut-off scores for large samples of older adults as fcai is intended to be used as a guide to determine the strengths and/or weaknesses in particular areas. it is worth mentioning here, that a positive correlation between the arithmetic score on the wais-iii and fcai, an assessment scale of financial competence (kershaw & webber, 2008). financial competence assessment tool (fcat) fcat has been developed in japan (sakuraba et al., 2004) and consists of 6 subordinate domains of financial competence, such as basic monetary skills, conceptual financial knowledge, use of banking institution, cash transactions, financial discernment, understanding of receipts and expenses. fcat has demonstrated financial deficits in ad patients (kumazawa et al., 2004), but also in younger patients with schizophrenia (niekawa et al., 2007). financial decision-making questionnaire (fdmq) fdmq has been developed and used in u.s. (cole & denburg, 2008). fdmq is also a performancebased instrument consisting of four scenarios examining 5 domains, namely personal finance, impulse purchase, low precision investment, and financial management, while the 4th scenario ends with assessing financial behavior in the form of two 7-point likert scales, in which the examinee indicates how important making money and avoiding financial loss are to the individual’s decision-making process. thus, financial knowledge (the ability to describe the knowledge of facts and concepts related to financial activities) and the ability to make relevant financial decisions are both examined as fdmq requires selecting and justifying financial choices across the four hypothetical scenarios in which participants receive and have to process increasingly complex financial information (cole & denburg, 2008; shivapour et al., 2012). 28 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ financial exploitation vulnerability scale (fevs) and financial exploitation vulnerability scale - short form (fevs-sf) fevs (lichtenbeg et al., 2021) and fevs-sf both aim to detect financial exploitation (campell & lichtenberg, 2021) in the u.s. fevs is web-based self-administered, and enables older adults to examine their risk levels for financial exploitation as well as their current perceived financial vulnerability. fevs is also used on the website as the financial vulnerability survey. fevs measures 17 contextual items that encompass financial strain, self-efficacy, financial behaviors, psychological vulnerability with respect to finances, and conflicts and relationship strain related to finances. financial incapability structured clinical assessment done longitudinally (fiscal) fiscal determines financial incapability and is focused on financial performance by examining whether individuals have been spending their funds in ways that do not meet their basic needs or results in harm to them (lazar et al., 2016). information comes from sources such as a semi-structured interview with the individual, as well as information from client psychiatric health records, and treating clinician ratings of the client. an integration of the three sources is accomplished, by reconciling discrepancies between the sources of information. four criteria for financial incapability are used: basic needs have not been met and funds needed for basic needs were spent on something else, substantial funds were spent on something that harmed the client (e.g., on illicit drugs or alcohol), participant’s misspending (not meeting basic needs or on harmful things) is likely to continue, and contextual factors are current conditions that modify the impact or probability of misspending. participants are determined financially incapable and capable by the fiscal (lazar et al., 2016). it is worth mentioning that although data exist for young and middle-aged adults with psychiatric diagnoses in u.s., no samples of older adults are included (although this instrument could be used for this age group as well) and no direct assessment of financial judgment is made. legal capacity for property law transactions assessment scale (lcpltas) lcpltas is based on the theoretical framework proposed by marson et al. (2000) with adjustments for the greek older population in the greek language and greek cultural-financial reality. lcpltas consists of 7 main domains measuring directly basic monetary skills, cash transactions, bank statement management, bill payment, financial conceptual knowledge, financial decision making, and knowledge of personal assets (giannouli, stamovlasis, & tsolaki, 2018; giannouli & tsolaki, 2014), but checkbook management and investment decisions are not examined as in fci as these two domains are considered irrelevant for greek older adults and their everyday life. simple and complex tasks as in fci as well as hypothetical culture-appropriate financial transaction scenarios are used in order to assess and quantify the ability to manipulate information rationally (compare and weigh the various risks and benefits associated with different courses of financial action) through logical processes. for lcpltas there is both a full as well as a short form, lasting half of the administration time, but with demonstrated reliability and validity. several studies have provided evidence for positive correlation between lcpltas and mmse total score (giannouli, stamovlasis, & tsolaki, 2018; giannouli & tsolaki, 2019b; 2021a; 2021e; 2022b; 2022d; stamovlasis et al., 2022). as in the case of fci cut-off scores (only for the greek 29 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ older population) have been proposed, and lcpltas classifies the (older) individuals as capable, marginally capable, or incapable. lichtenberg financial decision rating scale (lfdrs), lichtenberg financial decision rating scale short form (lfdrs-sf) and financial decision-making screening scale (lfdss) lfdrs consists of 4 subscales: financial situational awareness, psychological vulnerability, susceptibility to undue influence, and intellectual factors (i.e., decisional-ability factors) (lichtenberg et al., 2015). a shorter version of lfdrs is the 10-item lfdss (lichtenberg et al., 2016; 2017). questions related to choice, appreciation, understanding and rationale were all included in this screening scale. this shorter instrument focuses on the decision-making abilities subscale, which assesses intellectual factors. these are the functional abilities required for financial decision-making capacity, and include an older adult’s ability to express a choice, communicate the rationale for the choice, demonstrate understanding of the choice, and communicate appreciation of the relevant factors involved. several items from the susceptibility to undue influence subscale of lfdss are also included. a short form of the lichtenberg financial decision rating scale (lfdrs-sf) has also been suggested (lichtenberg, gross, & campbell, 2020). data for all these three versions exist for the american older population. money mismanagement measure (mmm) mmm was developed in u.s. and consists of 28 items and is a self-report instrument assessing financial judgment and secondarily performance. the domains that are included refer to questions on difficulties meeting basic needs, budgeting, paying bills, keeping track of funds over past month, and assessing financial situation (conrad et al., 2006). given that it is a self-report instrument, financial judgments are not directly examined, thus rendering its use better as a screening tool, rather an objective measure of financial decision-making. managing money scale (ilsmm) ilsmm is one of the oldest performance-based assessment scales in the u.s. (loeb, 1996). ilsmm consists of 4 tasks, focusing on counting money, completing financial calculations, paying bills, and taking precautions with money (loeb, 1996; mackin & areán, 2009; wood et al., 2014). measure of awareness of financial skills (mafs) mafs has been developed in canada and consists of three parts, 1) participant questionnaire, 2) informant questionnaire, and 3) performance measure. it is designed to measure awareness in financial management domain (cramer et al., 2004). the participant questionnaire contains questions about financial management focusing on difficulty or need of help in performing certain financial tasks. the informant questionnaire is an equivalent version of the participant questionnaire corroborating the gathered information. the performance measure has 6 (equivalent to the abovementioned questionnaires) financial tasks (e.g. identify and counting currency, cash transactions, writing checks, balancing checkbooks, and comprehension of statements/bills) (cramer et al., 2004; van wielingen et al., 2004). 30 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ older adult financial exploitation measure (oafem) oafem has been also used in u.s. and examines 6 domains of financial exploitation, namely theft and scams, abuse of trust, financial entitlement, coercion, signs of possible financial abuse, and difficulty managing money. it takes the form of a questionnaire (yes/no responses), which is designed to assess financial victimization of older adults falling in any of these 6 forms of financial exploitation (conrad, et al., 2010; conrad et al., 2011). one of the major drawbacks of oafem is that it is a scale that measures how much exploitation has taken place in the past, but it does not assess current performance-based financial judgment or decision-making capacity, such as understanding the consequences of a pending financial decision. thus, older adults who are not aware that they are being victimized, due to emotional manipulation and/or cognitive impairment, may not give an accurate self-report. semi-structured clinical interview for financial capacity (scifc) scifc is a clinician-oriented, semi-structured test that has been developed also by marson et al., (2009) in u.s., and it measures 7 relevant domains (basic monetary skills, financial conceptual knowledge, cash transactions, checkbook management, bank statement management, financial judgment, bill payment, plus one experimental domain that is knowledge of personal assets), thus excluding investment decisions which is a domain included in fci (marson et al., 2009). it does not need a trained technician for administration. a serious advantage of scifc is that it does not yield quantitative scores, but ratings (capable, marginally capable or incapable). timeline historical review of income and financial transactions (thrift) thrift is a semi-structured interview that uses a calendar timeline follow-back method to elicit information from individuals about their past month income, transactions or exchanges (such as letting a friend stay in one’s apartment in return for the friend’s paying for food), expenditures, debts, and account balances, which can be used to evaluate the individuals’ financial performance (black et al., 2013). thrift has been developed in u.s. may also tap into financial judgment in cases such as when an individual may recall spending that was not in his or her best interests), but it is under question whether thrift can detect individual’s ability to protect their own best interests in the case they do not self-report any problems with their spending. the acreemagnosia measurement (tam) tam is a multi-items measure that examines loss of financial knowledge or acreemagnosia from the ancient greek ἀ- (a-, “lack of”), χρήμα (creema, “money”) and γνωσιακή (gnοsis, “knowledge”) (κozlova et al., 2019). more specifically, awareness of financial abilities and actual performance on the broad range of everyday financial tasks is examined online in younger and older adults (κozlova et al., 2019). one major problem of this proposed instrument has been that it is used in a small sample from u.k., it is not published in a peer-reviewed journal and the data are preliminary as presented in a google scholar entry. 31 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ proposal of relevant neuropsychological assessment protocols mental capacity assessment follows two approaches: 1) the diagnostic approach and 2) the functional approach. the first one focuses on whether the person has a specific diagnosis (moye & marson, 2007), something that tells us little about the individuals’ capacities in everyday settings or if the individual is competent or incompetent regarding specific tasks instead of others (peisah et al., 2009). this heterogeneity in individual capacities and settings, makes the functional approach a better alternative. according to the functional approach, in specific contexts and tasks, different abilities are required in order to make a decision(s) (grisso, 2003; slovenko, 2006), thus the assessment of functional abilities focuses on the functional characteristics, contextual components, causal, interactive, and judgmental/ dispositional components (grisso, 2003). although the diagnosis of a neurocognitive disorder does have an overall negative impact on financial capacity (pinsker et al., 2010), additional factors should be taken into consideration in assessment protocols. for example, there is scientific literature supporting the influences of past values and preferences that the individual holds about financial issues (sahadevan et al., 2003; moye et al., 2005; moberg & rick, 2008). unawareness of financial deficits in patients with ad, frontotemporal dementia, and even mci also shapes financial performance through overestimations/ underestimations made by the patients themselves (giannouli & tsolaki, 2015; 2022a; 2022b; okonkwo et al., 2005; wadley, harrell, & marson, 2003). the diminished self-awareness/metacognition, that is the ability to evaluate one’s own cognitive performance as well as the ability to make adjustments in response to provided feedback, has implications in daily living and relevant financial decisions (lichtenberg, 2015). therefore, relevant instruments based on self-reports must be used with caution and performance-based measures should be preferred instead (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022a; 2022b; moore et al., 2007). this is a necessity especially in the case of unreliable information taking the form of misestimations of financial capacity made, intentionally or unintentionally, by third-party non-professional informants such as neighbors, friends, colleagues, caregivers and family members/relatives (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022a; pinsker et al., 2010; wadley et al., 2003). the influences of emotional functioning should be also added in relevant protocols (pinsker et al., 2010), as depressive symptomatology greatly impacts financial capacity performance in ad, mci, vascular dementia, and pdd (giannouli & tsolaki, 2019b; 2021a; 2021c; 2021d) and deteriorates financial capacity when overall cognitive performance also deteriorates in amci longitudinally (giannouli, stamovlasis, & tsolaki, 2022), especially when working memory declines (earnst et al., 2001). this negative impact of depression on financial capacity performance is not found for prior experience with stressful life events (giannouli & tsolaki, 2023b). nevertheless, a study supports that executive functioning and attention, but not depression severity, better predict financial capacity performance in older adults with depressive symptomatology (mackin & areán, 2009). negative affect without comorbid depression should also be examined in assessment protocols as there are negative correlations between financial capacity and negative affect even in cognitively intact older individuals (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022c). also, anxiety but not depression has been found to predict financial capacity performance in one study (pachana et al. 2014), but this finding may be possibly reflecting the relatively low variance of depressive symptoms in the assessed older sample (pachana et al., 2014). apart from personality and emotional factors (moberg & rick, 2008), undue influence is considered an important external factor for (financial) decisions of older adults, and the assessment of this vulnerability involves careful evaluation of social cognition and emotional cognition in financial interactions, 32 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ personality traits, as well as metacognition (lichtenberg, 2015; plotkin, spar & horwitz, 2016; quinn et al., 2017). a relevant tool has been developed for undue influence assessment (california undue influence screening tool, cuist) for use by the adult protective services (aps) as well as by other professionals in u.s. (quinn et al., 2017). another factor that should be incorporated in future assessment protocols is the education influences as illiterate older mci patients or mci patients with fewer years of education and little prior financial experience with relevant transactions suffer greater deficits in financial tasks and decisions compared to mci patients of a higher educational level (giannouli & tsolaki, 2021e), and regardless of the basic mathematical skills that may play the role of predictors (among other factors) for financial capacity (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022d; martin et al., 2012, sherod et al., 2009). although apoe ɛ4 gene has not been found to relate to financial capacity (giannouli &tsolaki, 2021f), greater regional tau burden has been found to modestly associate with financial capacity impairment in early-stage ad (gonzalez et al., 2022). this finding has been supported also in prodromal and mild stages of ad, for which an association can be claimed with the extent of cortical β-amyloid deposition, while for normal older adults evidence of β-amyloid deposition is associated with slowing of financial tasks (giannouli &tsolaki, submitted; tolbert et al., 2019). measured frailty has been related to reduced financial capacity (giannouli, 2022b). in addition to that, financial capacity is highly correlated to performance regarding simple arithmetic abilities (such as subtractions) (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022d) as indicated by brain regions (e.g. left angular gyrus), which reflect a possible relevant biological substrate. vascular burden is also having a detrimental effect on financial capacity performance (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022e), while findings support that indices such as sleep duration and sleep quality are directly linked to complex cognitive functions, such as financial capacity both in amci as well as mild ad patients (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022f). in addition to that, in mci patients there seems to be a specific order of appearance of financial capacity deficits and more specifically in financial capacity subdomains, such as cash transactions, bank statement management, and financial decision-making are the first to be impacted (giannouli & tsolaki, 2023c). furthermore, financial, social, and cultural aspects (pinsker et al., 2010) have to be taken into consideration, as older women are more easily declared ‘financially incapable’ compared to men with the same cognitive deficits in cultural settings such as the modern greek society (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022g), something that may reveal possible biases during testing as well. in addition to that, regardless of a possible neurocognitive disorder as a diagnosis, in some cultural settings (e.g. greek) compared to others (e.g. u.s.; choi et al., 2019a; 2019b), older adults seem not be involved at all in having a valid will, in assigning a durable power of attorney, and in having a written living will (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022h), something that renders them more vulnerable to financial exploitation. also, in ad patients more financial altruism has been reported cross-culturally in two countries (u.s.; weissberger et al., 2022, and greece; giannouli & tsolaki, 2022i) compared to amci patients and healthy controls (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022i). this may explain why older patients are more vulnerable to undue influence (peisah et al., 2009), when we also take into consideration that they do not have a previous will-making pattern to compare with when a financial change is made (o’neill & peisah, 2011). undue influence(s) or coercion is difficult to prove in courts even with a detailed history taking and collection of additional information from third-party sources (posener & jacoby, 2002), thus, all the abovementioned provide evidence for the necessity for older patients, to include in assessment protocols the examination of premorbid cognition, emotions, beliefs, values and preferences regarding 33 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ financial issues (moye et al., 2005) not only by asking the individuals themselves, but also their family members, caregivers, colleagues and friends (marson et al., 2012). future directions during covid-19 pandemic and afterwards, the older population is increasingly facing the threat of financial exploitation, thus rendering necessary not only the detection of financial (in)capacity, financial exploitation and undue influences, but also the implementation of relevant interventions aiming at individuals as well as healthcare professionals training in detecting and handling such cases, and society as a whole (giannouli & tsolaki, 2022j). a large impediment so far, not only cross-culturally, but also in assessments performed throughout a specific country are the differences in the choice of administered instrument(s), and differences in the collected information through history taking. implementation of a specific tool into practice, policy, procedures, and training of healthcare personnel depends on the reliability and validity of the proposed instruments and the existence of psychometric cut-off scores coming from standardization research in relevant large samples-populations for indentifying capacity status as objective reference points along with qualitative data (marson et al., 2000), and thus future work will need to address these issues. it is a fact that no standard, widespread, detailed protocols are applied even to western countries with similar sociocultural backgrounds throughout the european union (e.u.), not only due to differences in the legal systems and terminology, but also due to lack of research initiatives applying specific, routine protocols to large populations of older adults with or without brain pathology (alzheimer europe, 2016). therefore, it is important that qualified mental health professionals (neuropsychologists, geropsychologists, forensic psychologists and psychiatrists, neurologists, social workers etc.) carefully document the steps and methods used in their evaluations (sahadevan et al., 2003) and report the cognitive domain(s) affected, the extent of the impairment(s), and the functional consequences of the impairment(s) (sousa et al., 2014), while research should aim at this critical gap between research and practice across linguistic, cultural, medico-legal settings and cultures. another point for further consideration and research is that given that there is no gold standard clinical assessment for determining financial (in)capacity and no universal standards for reporting financial abuse especially in old age (greene, 2022), there is a dire need to utilize a combination of traditional interview, domain-specific instruments and neuropsychological testing (wood et al., 2020) regarding financial decision-making capacity in the aging adult population. in addition to that, in our technology-driven world, the fact that more and more older adults immerse in modern technologies, renders the development and administration of electronic financial instruments that aim such new financial electronic capacities also a necessity, along with online assessment instruments that are also needed in order to check older individuals at real time (giannouli, 2017b; green, 2022). in these assessments not only declarative knowledge, but also procedural knowledge reflecting the ability to carry out motor-based, overlearned practical financial skills and routines other than the traditional making of change and writing checks, have to be included such as the new online banking procedures (marson et al., 2000; moye & marson, 2007). as the existing assessment tools (questionnaires or tests) are all paper-and-pencil and are not up-to-date regarding new financial threats/risks (financial cybercrime/cyberfraud) encountered in such procedures in the virtual world (green, 2022), a new perspective can be given by electronic versions of existing tests and questionnaires, as well as the 34 neuropsychological assessment and financial capacity in older adults ﻿ adaptation of e-relevant assessment protocols in order to go to remote, unsupervised, and online use of new instruments. for example, relevant performance-based instruments are the financial capacity instrument-short form (fci-sf), called efci (howell et al., 2022), as well as the proposed but still not administered and validated to older adults, electronic financial instrument screening tool (efist), which is a 24-item questionnaire aiming to aid in identifying potential vulnerabilities for elder financial abuse (greene, 2022). conclusion younger and older adults are presumed to have capacity to make financial decisions for themselves, but this capacity may, temporarily or permanently, be lost, due to illness or accident (darzins et al., 2004). if financial and decision-making capacity is diminished or lost while the older individual has access to money/property, others need to recognize this, and take appropriate steps to prevent financial exploitation, usually with the appointment of a legal guardian/representative. nevertheless, having a representative appointed to manage an older person’s financial affairs is considered to have positive effects on the beneficiary, but is still risky for financial abuse, paternalistic as it encourages dependence, it is not minimally restrictive, and may be stigmatizing for the elder and his/her family (dixon et al., 1999; elbogen et al., 2008; giannouli, 2014), thus supported decision-making could be an alternative patient-centered approach that enables and encourages people to play a role in the management of their own finances (national academies of sciences engineering and medicine, 2016). although there is relevant research and data coming from different cultural settings and assessment instruments, still there is no comparison between all these approaches in understanding and assessing financial capacity/exploitation. therefore, this lack of a unified approach in the form of a multidimensional protocol-algorithm that includes and combines all relevant aspects of financial capacity/exploitation, best practices, guidelines and methodologies, is rendering it difficult not only to provide practical advice to laypeople across different countries, but also renders communication across professionals impossible in the same cultural settings. acknowledgment the author would like to thank fulbright foundation in greece. references alzheimer europe.

one of the world’s major demographic and social issues today, with a particularly important framework in the most industrialized and developed societies. recent changes and prospective population analyses have pointed to unprecedented opportunities and challenges for systems and policies, which must reflect the possibility of individuals remaining autonomous for as long as possible. this trend requires sustained planning for aging populations to ensure that risks are minimized and opportunities are maximized. suppose the gains achieved in longevity were the result of the various interventions of public health. in that case, it is also expected to be its responsibility the interventions for the challenges ahead regarding the dynamics of aging, whose operationalization should focus on maintaining and promoting the health of older individuals. numerous documents from international organizations refer to the need to follow this challenge for healthy aging, a process that respects all stages of the life cycle based on the health, participation, and security of individuals, the result of which should be to promote longer and, above all, healthier lives. moreover, if this is an interactive process whose changes intersect and are reflected in the lives of individuals, societies, and countries, it will naturally be a process that requires modifications and adaptations at the individual, social, and organizational levels. one of the platforms for exercising public health in this context concerns reducing social inequalities in health. this aspect tends to increase with age and, despite encompassing different socioeconomic, behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors, the empowerment we provide to individuals in terms of health education may be decisive in minimizing these inequalities. knowing these interactions through interdisciplinary research will also be a challenging task for public health, whose development must respect the diversity and heterogeneity of older people, the aptitude and accountability of local decision-makers, and a conceptually and dimensionally comprehensive environment that promotes healthy aging. along with the demographic transition observed in recent decades resulting from low birth and mortality levels and high longevity, an epidemiological transition has reflected the changing pattern of diseases and causes of death resulting from societal changes that include urbanization, consumption, and lifestyle habits. although mortality rates have remained high in developing countries, the global trend points towards an increase in chronic and degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, oncological diseases, dementias, and diabetes. in the epidemiological context of the elderly population, it is also pivotal to consider the risk for infectious diseases resulting from the senescence of immune and homeostatic functions or the greater interaction of chronic versus infectious comorbidities. thus, in the coming years, knowing the mechanisms and components that contribute to changes in the functioning of the elderly population, whether in the absence or the presence of acute or acquired disease, will be a challenge for all areas of knowledge. for public health, this will not only be a determining obstacle for its intervention but also the acceptance to consider the functioning of individuals and populations as an unavoidable variable in its study. this consideration or evaluation is not intended to be complex or extensive, although it does require the possibility of reproducing the limitations in the activities of individuals and quantifying the need for equipment, services, and systems that promote the capacity and performance of these activities. this goal has not been fully achieved, and some weaknesses have been observed in different countries 50 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ regarding functioning-related variables. most health surveys or censuses are weak in terms of quantity and the standardization of concepts, the latter being crucial for epidemiological comparison, especially for the early detection of groups or populations at risk. nevertheless, adopting the biopsychosocial model operationalized by the international classification of functioning, disability, and health (icf) has enabled one to observe positive progress in this difficult, as attested to by the mhadie (measuring health and disability in europe) (leonardi et al, 2010a); (leonardi et al, 2010b)) and murinet (multidisciplinary research network on health and disability in europe) (leonardi et al, 2012) multicentric projects, which concluded globally the need to coordinate and integrate the concepts of functioning/disability at all levels of policy-making and in all sectors. it is known that health and social science professionals are already aware of its multidimensionality over 20 years after the dissemination of the model and the icf. one can observe, however, that they are still faced with difficulties in understanding the interactivity and integrative capacity that underlie them. hence, they are still far from accepting or understanding them in an absolute way as a conceptual model, but above all, as an action model. we still maintain a powerful rootedness concerning the dialectics of the biomedical model, both in terms of academic resources and our professional practices. admitting and acting equitably and dynamically with all the dimensions we know today of functioning remains a strenuous exercise to manage and put into practice. in rehabilitation, assessment and intervention processes are the paradigms of this biological determinism by focusing almost exclusively or preferentially on changes in physiological functions, with significant neglect of contextual, environmental, and personal factors. these contextual factors, now conceptualized much more comprehensively, have a primary and central role in the icf. they go beyond their importance as determinants of health status and are now considered not only as a change to the locus of disability, but above all, they are recognized as the locus of intervention and, therefore, of functioning. in this chapter, the authors reflect on the conceptual aspects of functioning/disability in the elderly population and the importance of these concepts for developing public health. 2. background a) conceptual aspects of functioning and disability the concepts related to binomial functioning/disability frame an evolution that reflects transformations in the health sciences and encompasses changes operating in the social field. the evolution of these constructs has appeared naturally linked to the evolution of the health/illness binomial, which is also a result of these mutations and their models, whose major movement took place between the biomedical and social models. the 1960s were fruitful in the process of change regarding the concept of disability; individual responsibility for this condition was abandoned, social commitment and involvement were admitted, and the first policies and legislation on the integration and inclusion of people with disabilities were created and defined (barnes & mercer, 2003). from the standpoint of fundamental assertions, the biomedical model explains disability or, broadly speaking, impairment or disease based on deviations from the norm of measurable biological (somatic) variables, in which biological indices are the only criteria for its definition, where the disease occurs dichotomously as a biological problem and health as the absence of 51 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ disease. the conceptual-affective autonomy of the patient is not considered, promoting in them a passive and obedient role whose outcome derives from the epistemological authority of the physician/therapist. the social model of disability, nevertheless, considers it a problem created by society and, basically, an issue of full integration of the individual in society. in this sense, disability is not an individual attribute but the result of a complex set of conditions, many created by the surrounding environment, whose resolution requires social action and accountability, particularly with a view to environmental modifications, which is necessary to fully integrate people with disabilities in all social areas. in addition to the therapeutic dialectics of disability and impairment, the biomedical and social models involve differences in other domains, such as policies, intervention models, or the cultural environment, as explained in table 1. based on the combination of the two previous models, but without using them up, the biopsychosocial approach to functioning/disability emerged with engel in 1977. this author pointed out the relativization of the biomedical and social models in this framework, pointing out the accountability and dynamic interconnection of the biological, psychological, and social dimensions in interpreting human functioning. according to the biopsychosocial model, the theoretical and methodological goal of medicine should consist of the interconnection of the person’s biological, psychological, and social dimensions, where each dimension alone cannot account for health or disease. it is precisely on this assumption that the biomedical model is criticized since treatments based exclusively on it are insufficient. “rational treatment (...) directed only at the biochemical abnormality does not necessarily restore the patient’s health, even when we envisage correction or relief of the abnormality (...) the biochemical deficiency may determine certain characteristics of the disease, but not necessarily the point at which the person becomes ill or accepts the role or status of patient” (engel, 1977). table 1. conceptual paradigms of

responsibility social policy; welfare provision transversal policies 52 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ although the literature refers to other theories (masala & petretto, 2008), the operationalization of functioning/disability has been discussed and been based mainly on three conceptual schemes: that of the sociologist saad nagi and the who models, in its first version through the international classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps (icidh) and in its most recent version through the icf. these three models are schematized in figure 1. saad nagi’ model of disability is considered the pioneer in describing the disability process. this author proposed a process divided into four stages with unidirectional and sequential linearity. pathology interrupts the normal process of physical and mental functioning, leading to an impairment of functions and structures, which necessarily leads to a limitation in the individual’s usual activities, finally precipitating an inability to perform expected or expected social roles (nagi, 1976). in this model, disability is based on a strong social construction, especially the inability to perform social roles and activities related to work and family, even when this author also identifies a disability at the individual level. the major criticisms of this model are related to a sequential causality that often does not exist and the absence of the interaction of individual and environmental factors. the icidh (who, 1980) was created figure 1. the conceptual schemes of functioning/disability according to nagi and the who 53 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ to support the international classification of diseases (icd), which conceptualized a classification of the consequences of the disease, still very much rooted in the biomedical model. the contemporaneity of cultural changes and the emancipation of movements for equality and opportunity for people with disabilities precipitated early recognition of its weaknesses, which resulted in successive revisions. it has been criticized for its lack of relationship between the different dimensions, unidimensional nature, the predominance of a negative terminology very focused on disability, the reference to the biomedical, sequential, and causal model, disability being seen as an individual and direct result of disability, and the almost non-existent approach to social and contextual aspects. before the transformations that the icf went through until it reached its final version in 2001, we highlight the importance of two authors, verbrugge and jette, who developed a model that associated the two previously described, also emphasizing the importance of intra-individual and extra-individual factors in the process of disability development for the first time (verbrugge & jette, 1994). although it is not a very interactive and multidirectional model, the authors already mentioned the possibility of rupture in the sequence of the different dimensions. in other words, they highlighted the possibility that disability may arise without a disability or that disability may not necessarily lead to disability. after various studies and drafts, the icidh gave way to the icf, which was approved at the 54th world health assembly on may 22, 2001 (who, 2001). the icf operationalizes a new paradigm of functioning/disability, health/disease, quality of life, and well-being, where social skills, personal abilities, and physical capacity are emphasized in a multidirectional and dynamic way where all its components interact equally with each other. hence, functioning and disability operate on a continuum and interactively in relation to personal health status, individual resources, and the environment, establishing a new framework of philosophical principles, as presented in table 2. although assessing disabilities is not negligible, the icf emphasizes the importance of assessing the difficulties at the level of activities/participation that individuals experience due to the interaction of their physiological potential and the social environment where they move. hence, the importance that environmental factors acquire in determining the functioning/disability of individuals and populations is that the objectives of the interventions are created in a balanced relationship between the individual potential and the physical, social, and attitudinal facilitation of the environment. maintaining functioning during the aging process refers us to other multidimensional and interactive constructs, including successful, healthy, or active aging. although some of them maintain some table 2. icf principles functionality

difficulties, others are better defined, and it is not our intention to make a conceptual analysis of their similarities or differences, which has already been well discussed by other authors (bowling & dieppe, 2005; crimmins, 2004). what matters to us is to establish a guideline that can embrace a common aspect to all: how to identify, maintain, and enhance the functioning of individuals linked to their chronological longevity in the last stages of the life cycle, the one we know, and the one we foresee in the near future. in this sense, functioning or, for some authors, human functioning (stucki et al., 2008), should be fundamentally measured by mobility and activities of daily living because these are the most important aspects for individuals considering the positive or negative interference that contextual factors have on these components. despite this assumption, the continuous systematization of the process of functioning assessment in the elderly has not yet been given the importance it deserves by the medical and social care professionals, nor is it assiduously included in the patient’s clinical history. nevertheless, this type of baseline assessment is an adequate and useful way to operationalize the care provided to the elderly; it detects disabilities, creates opportunities for enhancing the remaining abilities, allows for identifying individual needs, defining therapeutic goals, planning and implementing interventions, and assessing their effect (thonnard & penta, 2007). in addition, the totality of these outcomes facilitates and promotes the prevention and control of risks that persist in geriatric units (zelada et al., 2009). mobility is the ability to move one’s body through space, including walking, standing up, changing position, or climbing stairs (studenski, 2003a). these tasks inherent to mobility are actions necessary for constructing both the basic activities of daily living (badl) or self-care (e.g., bathing, dressing, and eating) and the instrumental activities of daily living (iadl), also known as extended activities (e.g., household chores, preparing meals, shopping, and managing money). walking is the primary task of human mobility and functioning, and is at the same time complex concerning the associated neuro-motor functions and dependent on many variables, such as musculoskeletal functions (buchman et al., 2010; ostchegaat al, 2004; sakari et al., 2010), sensory functions (deshpande & patla, 2007), neuro-motor control (gerin-lajoie et al., 2006), and cognitive status (watson et al., 2010). there is empirical evidence that objective measurement or self-report of walking ability in the elderly is a powerful predictor of performance for activities of daily living (abellan van kan et al., 2009; studenski et al., 2003b), falls (wrisley & kumar, 2010), hospitalization (studenski et al., 2003b), and mortality (hardy et al., 2007; studenski et al., 2011). if we are in the presence of populations with satisfactory or high levels of independence, gait speed should be replaced or accompanied by more demanding tests such as stair climbing/descending (weiss et al., 2007). the ability to walk can be measured in various ways. the most common, practical, and objective, especially in the elderly population, is the one that measures the time to walk 4 or 8 meters using a stopwatch or a pedometer (abellan van kan et al., 2009; viccaro et al., 2011); the normal walking speed in healthy adults varies between 1.2 and 1.4 m/s, decreasing from 50/60 years of age (bohannon, 1997). all these studies support the premise that gait speed is a fundamental indicator of the state of the underlying physiological systems and an important predictor of some measures or markers of health; it has also been dubbed the sixth vital sign by some researchers (fritz & lusardi, 2009). in this regard, it is essential to standardize assessment measures and establish cut points for both clinical and research to identify these associations (graham et al., 2008). some studies have been able to advance values that can serve as a reference for interventions. for instance, for cesari et al. (2005), a speed <1 m/s can identify 55 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ a high risk for health and functioning in the elderly, or a speed <0.6 m/s can identify an inability for badls and an increased risk for hospitalization (studenski et al., 2003b). in a review of 9 cohort studies, studenski et al. (2011) concluded that improvements of >0.1 m/s could significantly increase the survival rate of the individuals. along with mobility, activities related to self-care should also be assessed in the elderly population, given that their results have a critical predictive value both for institutionalization and mortality (gill et al., 1998; hjaltadottir et al., 2011; keeler et al., 2010). additionally, they are the most important for the individual, representing the possibility of living autonomously or independently. some studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, have analyzed hierarchically the disability or the progressive decline of tasks related to self-care and instrumental activities, organizing an evolutionary pattern of disability of these activities (jagger et al., 2001; kempen et al., 1995; kingston et al., 2012; weiss et al., 2007), although the associations with age and sex, or even with environmental factors, are important aspects of differentiation. most studies have also reported that instrumental activities precede those related to self-care in difficulty (jagger et al., 2001; kempen et al., 1995; kingston et al., 2012; weiss et al., 2007); nonetheless, this dichotomy may be too reductionist or simplistic. a study by ferrucci et al. (1998) involving seven sample groups from five european countries was perhaps the first to use another organization. the progression of disability was made by domains (containing different but equally demanding tasks) considering the functions associated with them: dexterity, balance, and limb strength. considering this possibility, we find different conclusions regarding this hierarchy depending on the implied physiological function. if we are identifying dexterity (for example, nail clipping), disability will occur first in the upper limbs (ferrucci et al., 1998; kingston et al., 2012), although if we consider strength function, it will decline initially in the lower limbs (jagger et al., 2001). these aspects, together with others, such as the limited inclusion of questions (usually no more than 5 or 6), which may lead to a floor effect, the non-differentiation of activities for men and women, which may be relevant in terms of iadls (the difference between “not doing” and having the “inability to do”) and the lack of inclusion of older adults (≥85 years), lead to the conclusion that we maintain some inhibitions about the knowledge of the evolution of disability at the activity level (kingston et al., 2012). in addition to all of these aspects, as pointed out in numerous studies, it is essential to emphasize the importance or the effect that cognitive functions and contextual factors can have on this type of assessment. however, individuals have motor potential, cognitive impairments can inhibit the ability and performance of activities, and environmental factors can manifest themselves as barriers, hindering this ability and performance in the same way. among the daily activities commonly tested, bathing is recurrently referred to as the one that produces the most significant limitation in the elderly population, which usually precedes other basic difficulties and is also one of the tasks as an important causes of fractures (gill et al., 2006; naik et al., 2004; bleijlevens et al., 2010). in this sense, it is critical to shed more light on specific aspects of this activity, which may help caregivers in their intervention strategies. for instance, to know which sub-tasks are assigned to them, which are more difficult to perform, which are the major difficulties that the elderly indicate for their performance, and which and how environmental factors may be associated with them. as for the sub-tasks, leaving the bathing position is referred to as the most difficult task to perform (naik et al., 2004); this action associates the integrity of several systems with an important neuro-motor control in a short temporal and spatial space. first-person accounts mention that the most frequent and impeding causes for the independent performance of this task are balance deficit, arthritic complaints, 56 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ and the fear of falling (naik et al., 2004). as for environmental factors, namely assistive devices and physical alterations to the bathroom, they are still rarely used and can be a valuable aid to the ability to perform the bath (naik & gill, 2005). nonetheless, for gill et al. (2007), these supports do not always benefit individuals; they may be an aid but may also anticipate further limitations. for these authors, non-slip mats improve bathing performance, although bath seats/chairs and grab bars may precipitate disability by decreasing sensory and motor stimulation (gill et al., 2007). this conclusion deserves important reflection and differentiation about the safety of the individuals and their remaining capacities; while sensory motor stimulation is at the basis of all rehabilitative interventions, any situation should be guided by the safety of the individual. finding the balance between this union allows one to better understand the differentiation between the results and the professionals. after bathing, the activity “dressing” appears in research as the activity that produces the most significant limitation, even in the presence of groups without defined disabilities (walker et al., 2012); this activity demands dexterity, visuospatial coordinates, and apraxia (sunderland et al., 2006). the act of dressing, regardless of the manual skills required, involves recognizing parts and an ordered selection and sequence, making it a complex task (feyereisen et al., 1999). another study also states that the persistent limitations found in the different subtasks of this activity are determined by the specificity of cognitive impairment (walker et al., 2004). regarding instrumental activities usually organized by the lawton and brody index (1969), they require a more elaborate ability not only of the functions associated with them (limb strength, mobility, balance, coordination, sensory functions, and cognition) but also an adequate interaction with an external environment, with multiple requests and demands, and not always familiar. from a physiological point of view, their demands can be divided into two major groups; some require primarily cognitive activity (using the phone, money management, or medication management), while others add an important dose of neuromusculoskeletal functions (shopping, cooking, and household activities). as already mentioned, a common determinant component related to the restriction of participation in more elaborate activities is related to mobility as a basic component of the interaction of the individual with the environment. this association is closer when activities are directed to the outside or the community (desrosiers et al., 2009; fairhall et al., 2011). some researchers have also mentioned that in cognitive terms, the performance of instrumental activities depends on global cognitive activity, mainly visuospatial perception and executive cognitive skills (glosser et al., 2002; jefferson et al., 2006a; bell-mcginty et al., 2002; boyle et al., 2004; jefferson et al., 2006b). although the concept or definition of executive skills or functions is not perfectly unanimous in the literature, most authors refer to them as a set of functions that includes working memory, planning, initiation, and execution of intentional behaviors, where inhibition, mental flexibility, and problem-solving are included among others (jefferson et al., 2006c; johnson et al., 2007). all of these functions tend to decline at older ages (mitchell & miller, 2008; borson, 2010), and even when this decline is slight, it can influence ability in daily tasks, especially those related to more elaborate activities (johnson et al., 2007). however, the dependence between cognitive function versus ability/performance in activity is not always linear. although conclusive studies on this relationship are scarce, using the telephone, using transportation, and managing medication and money seem to be those tasks where a greater association is found (barberger-gateau et al., 1992; bell-mcginty et al., 2002). nonetheless, we found studies showing that the tasks most involved with cognition require mandatory sequencing; in this case, preparing meals, doing laundry, or managing money may be more impaired (jefferson et al., 2006c). 57 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ finally, the question here is how executive functions can be measured to have a concrete understanding of their influence on activity performance and independent living. most studies report that these functions have a higher predictive value for activity performance when compared to global cognitive assessment tests such as the mini-mental test examination (bell-mcginty et al., 2002; jefferson et al., 2006c; johnson et al., 2007; royall et al., 2004). there is no consensus in the literature regarding the form (self-report, caregiver interview, or direct measurement) and the tests to measure the various functions involved in the different components of these activities, nor which one or more have a more substantial value. those that exist are very different concerning the samples’ age, education, cognitive status, or comorbidities, making evidence on this subject difficult. is important that integrate knowledge about the ability and performance of activities of daily living with that about cognitive functioning, which can be valued and harnessed for epidemiology, especially for more effective intervention strategies. this new understanding may precipitate the need to revise some tests that better capture and fit the variations or outcomes of activities/participation. despite the difficulties, the advanced cognitive training for independent and vital elderly (active) study, one of the largest multicenter controlled longitudinal studies to evaluate cognitive training in the elderly, provided some important findings for future studies (gross et al., 2011). inductive reasoning appears to be the best predictor of the functioning of daily activities at the initial assessment, with that place taken by memory at the final assessment. at the same time, action processing speed proved to be the poorest predictor at both assessment times (gross et al., 2011). another important aspect when analyzing the performance of more elaborate activities is related not only to the different functions or components of cognition, as already mentioned, but also to the association or determination that contextual, personal, and/or environmental factors may have in this process (burton et al., 2006). for example, wilkie et al. (2007) reported that personal factors (health status, economic status, and occupation) were associated with the performance of most outdoor-related instrumental activities. while there may be a relationship between self-care and instrumental activities, they depend on a much broader set of those factors. after reviewing the literature on basic and instrumental activities, we will now clarify how this dichotomy is combined in the current conceptual framework of functioning. as we mentioned, they are distinguished by the complexity and variability of the functions that interact with them and by the absence or presence of an external or social environment. in the icf, this dichotomy does not exist; we can find in the same domain basic and instrumental activities; for instance, “using transportation” appears in the mobility domain, together with the basic activity “getting up/sitting down.” additionally, the activity “managing medication” appears alongside “bathing” and “dressing” in the self-care domain. in other words, in terms of classification, activities are a single component that can be differentiated according to whether they are performed in a standard or uniform environment — activity — or in a real-life environment — participation — which, in turn, are linked in terms of the constructs of capacity and performance, respectively. this division, not always perceptible and conciliatory in academic and clinical environments, has caused some controversy (guralnik & ferrucci, 2009). nevertheless, above all, it commits us to a new paradigm on basic versus instrumental activities, specifically in the universe of assessing ability and performance. this separation resides or is established by the environment where it occurs or happens. although we know some results about this division (jette et al., 2003), the operationalization of its definitions is unclear, as we will demonstrate herein. any activity can be performed either in the usual or real environment (the home, other dwellings, neighborhood, and the city), where the individual moves 58 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ (performance), or in another social environment, which is real, is not the usual (performance) or even in a standard or uniform environment (icf nomenclature), which being real is not the usual (ability) (who, 2001). therefore, while the environment can differentiate these constructs, it cannot distinguish them entirely; the who points out that performance always corresponds to the interaction with real environmental factors, in the capacity these factors also exist. the difference is that it is assumed that they are “standardized,” with a “neutral” action on the individual (who, 2001). according to the who, capacity reveals the aptitude or the maximum level of functioning that an individual can achieve in an adjusted environment, or even that the difference between capacity and performance reflects the difference between the real and uniform environment or also the impact that the real environment (physical, social, and attitudinal) has on the person’s performance (who, 2001). by circumventing these methodological and conceptual difficulties, we are interested in contributing to their operationalization in the context of rehabilitation teams, with regard to assessment and intervention, but mainly in the objectives and outcomes for individuals. following what we have previously reflected as a new paradigm in the evaluation system — decentralizing the process from functions and converging it to activities — it seems to us that the next step for intervention is to know how this step of the process is articulated with the final goal: acquisition or maximization of the person’s participation, participation being the maximum level of autonomy and independence that we hold in a “habitual or real-life involvement or experience” (who, 2001). our therapeutic interventions take place in uniform or standard environments, which may or may not approximate the actual environments of the individuals. in this sense, if we stick to those environments, what we achieve is in the realm of ability, which may fall short of the needs for performance and participation. approximating and simulating therapeutic environments to the reality of the spaces and surroundings where people move will increase the possibility of therapeutic results being more adjusted to the real needs of individuals. b) disability and morbidity in a framework of increased life expectancy the conceptual and methodological difficulties we have pointed out have caused impediments to the knowledge and comparison of data on the functioning/disability of populations, specifically the elderly population, not only in contemporary terms but also concerning its trend or predictability. bypassing this obstacle and looking at some available results, disability decreased in the last decades (lee et al., 2020; rector et al., 2020; fuller-thomson et al., 2023). these results, which occurred essentially in the last two decades of the last century, were the consequence of two major groups of factors: i) improvement in medical and pharmacological procedures, especially in rheumatic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cataracts, and hip and knee replacements and ii) improvement in education and living standards of the populations (brown et al., 2012; schoeni et al., 2008), resulting in less disabling diseases and/or whose progression is stopped before the onset of disability (crimmins & beltrán-sánchez, 2011). when analyzing the data on the evolution of disability for different activities, as in the study by freedman et al. (2008), the authors concluded that there is an improvement in those related to self-care, although there was stability in the results observed in those related to instrumental activities. hung et al. (2011), whose cohort was studied in 1998, 2004, and 2008, observed some improvements, and despite being insignificant, the results are expected to remain stable. in this study, the analysis by age 59 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ stratification revealed improved activities in the older age group, and these results corroborate schoeni et al. (2008) and fuller-thomson et al. (2023) the addition of dependent variables to the logistic regression model in the study by martin et al. (2010) allowed us to conclude that smoking, obesity, and education are explanatory markers of the results obtained, which are globally consistent with those previously mentioned. for the authors, education, specifically adopting healthier lifestyles, access to health care, health literacy, use of assistive devices, and reduction or even the cessation of smoking and obesity control, may be the bridges to the explanation and trend of disability in older populations in the coming years. the literature review by christensen et al. (2009) discussed disability trends between 1985–2002 for older people aged 85 years and under and concluded that there is a trend toward decreasing disability in the younger age group in most countries. this review also raised two hypotheses for the coming years based on two trends: “the failure of success” and “the success of success.” regarding the first, the authors predicted that the cohort of individuals who live to be 100 years old will show an increase in disability at that age alone. in other words, we will see a tendency for the onset of disease and disability to manifest late, concentrated at very advanced ages, individualizing a fourth age, which is believed to be characterized by high rates of disability and dependence. for the second hypothesis, the authors advocate that exceptionally longlived “super-survivors” will enjoy the “success of success,” reaching these ages without an increase in disability. the study concluded, however, that we still have no data to make predictions about disability for ages >85. this issue of morbidity compression at older ages is advocated by fries et al. (2011) as a necessary attribute of healthy aging. it should be accepted as a construct that allows assessing health gains and losses throughout the life cycle. the work of these authors, which includes a broad analysis of studies in terms of methodological variability, concludes that if we have been able to improve this indicator in the last thirty years without well-defined strategies, we should now be able to improve and understand it better if we plan our interventions in a more systematized way. the issue of morbidity compression is far from being unanimously accepted because, given it is a highly dynamic process, there are many variables to be taken into account and many that we have yet to master or understand; the age of onset of disability (which includes all its components) and the probability of recovery of functions and activities are essential parts of the process of change in health status and may precede mortality. the work of crimmins and beltrán-sánchez (2011), while not being so optimistic about some of the factors included in the compression of morbidity, agrees concerning aspects related to functioning and disability, warning, however, that the results observed are due to the decrease in prevalence, but that the incidence values do not have similar representation. on the other hand, in lee et al (2020) multicenter study, it was concluded that significant gains in life expectancy have translated into different gains in healthy years of life across different countries; for countries such as belgium, czechia, and mexico, it is noted an increase of disability prevalence, whereas in countries such as denmark, england, greece, korea, poland, and sweden, it is observed a substantial decrease in disability prevalence. in this way, the authors conclude that diverse time trends in disability prevalence across countries reaffirm that the expansion of late-life disability is not inevitable. also the paper of crimmins et al (2020) presents empirical work incorporating the social hallmarks of aging with indicators of multiple biological hallmarks of aging as well as downstream biology in explaining a range of health outcomes. results show the relative strength of the associations of social and biological measures with important health outcomes. social factors are strongly related to physical and cognitive functioning and multimorbidity in this older population; this remains true when the significant 60 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ number of biological measures are controlled. these results can be interpreted to mean that a significant amount of the social variance in age-related health outcomes is not explained by these measures of biology. attention to the social hallmarks related to human aging can usefully be incorporated into work on the biological hallmarks of aging to make greater progress in understanding functioning and human aging. c) functioning and aging in the context of public health the demographic changes observed in recent years and projected for the near future, associated with the epistemological evolution of functioning/disability, have projected new paradigms of action and mediation in public health, which respond systematically to the current organizational, legislative, and structural needs. furthermore, because living more years is associated with a higher probability of losing functioning, this success has produced a new phenomenon in all scientific domains: a large segment of the population lives with disability and it is the universe of public health to know how to consider and account for this phenomenon (lollar & crews, 2003). the technological advances in health sciences have increased life expectancy by 30 years in some countries in the last century (cdcp, 2011), so the public health performance of the last century, embodied by the definition of being the science and art of disease prevention and health promotion, now has a broader frame of reference and action. riegelman and kirkwood (2014) advocated for a broader definition for the 21st century that includes a broad spectrum of the population perspective: the totality of all evidence-based public and private efforts that preserve and promote health and prevent disease, disability, and death. this definition expands the traditional scope of public health by including a broad assessment of environmental, social, and economic determinants, including an assessment of healthrelated interventions, the structure, and functioning of systems of care, the equity of their distribution, and also the role of public policy (riegelman & kirkwood, 2014). evaluation is one of the imperative functions of public health; it is described as a process of systematic and routine monitoring of the health of populations, where people with temporary or permanent disability (s) are now an important fraction of this set, especially in older age groups. for lollar and crews (2003), three procedures must be adopted to achieve this goal: the acceptance and development of disability as an inescapable variable in monitoring the health of populations, the identification, and differentiation of subgroups or typologies that disability may reveal, and finally, the assessment and monitoring of personal and environmental factors as decision-makers in the process. along with the demographic variables that usually describe the populations, it is crucial to identify their level of disability through simple but robust questions supported by the icf conceptual framework and as described by the evidence (lollar & crews, 2003). this core of questions need not be lengthy but should be an integral part of any national health census or survey, the results of which can mainly reproduce the limitations in activities and the need for equipment, services, and systems that promote the capacity and performance of those activities. overall, the results can quantify the need for services and supports, study the life course of people with specific disabilities, and precisely target prevention strategies (mcdermott & turk, 2011). national health surveys have progressively included questions on activity-related disability/participation, although not always collected in a similar and transversal way and not always organized by the domains of functioning that we now know to be important in determining the functioning/disability profiles of the populations. hence, it has been difficult to accurately assess the characterization and progression of these domains, making it difficult to plan and systematize interventions. 61 reflections on functioning and disability in aging and public health ﻿ assuming disability as a determining variable in the study of public health, the next step concerns the possibility of it characterizing the different levels of disability and consequently differentiating the needs of individuals and populations. calling upon the different domains of icf activities/participation for this identification and their qualifiers seems to be the way forward. knowing the individual competencies and the environment where people move will be determinant to the involution or evolution of their disability, not only as interactive factors of this process, but mainly as determinants of the locus of action, intervention, and resolution. the predictability of increased longevity seems to be a given; regardless of the uncertainty about its consequences in terms of morbidity and disability — compression, expansion, or dynamic balance — public health will always have a key role in this monitoring, guided by the preventing diseases and disability at its different levels of intervention (fries et al., 2011). in this way, the future research in public health might include (who, 2015): i) establishing regular population surveys of older people that can reflect in detail the functional ability; intrinsic capacity; specific health states; need for health care or long-term care or broader environmental changes, and whether these needs are being met; ii) mapping trends in intrinsic capacity and functional ability in different birth cohorts and determining whether increasing life expectancy is associated with added years of health; identifying indicators and mechanisms for the continuous surveillance of healthy ageing trajectories. conclusion the conceptual standardization of functioning/disability in the elderly population is crucial to organizing strategies that promote greater autonomy and independence for this group. the who has made a significant contribution to this development by creating the icf and by continuously promoting its updating, namely with the introduction of relevant, more identifiable, and explicit categories of functioning/ disability throughout the entire life cycle of individuals. public health must adopt the icf conceptual model in developing policies and actions aimed at the elderly population, given that there are no other instruments capable of capturing consistent and reliable data on functioning and disability in such a structured way. comprehensive public-health action on ageing is urgently needed. the societal response to population ageing will require a transformation of health systems that moves away from disease-based curative models and towards the provision of older-person-centered and integrated care. it must be built on a fundamental shift in our understanding of ageing to one that takes account of the diversity of older populations and responds to the inequities that often underlie ageing. and it will need to draw on better ways of measuring and monitoring the health and functioning of older populations. references abellan van kan, g., rolland, y., andrieu, s., bauer, j., beauchet, o., bonnefoy, m., cesari, m., donini, l. m., gillette guyonnet, s., inzitari, m., nourhashemi, f., onder, g., ritz, p., salva, a., visser, m., & vellas, b.

examines the effectiveness of the perma model of wellbeing in enhancing reminiscence in elderly individuals. reminiscence is a process of recollecting past experiences, events, and memories, and it is commonly used as a therapeutic intervention to promote wellbeing in the elderly. the perma model integrates positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment to enhance overall wellbeing. this chapter focuses on how the model can promote reminiscence and improve psychological wellbeing, social connectedness, and reduce depression and anxiety. the perma model was chosen for its holistic approach and positive effects on the elderly population. it is important to incorporate the perma model in enhancing reminiscence and to promote positive aging and enhance quality of life. introduction our chapter will try to expose a conceptual approach of the perma model of wellbeing in enhancing reminiscence in elderly individuals. through a literature review, will address the concepts and theoretical constructs of the perma model, and its contribution to enhancing reminiscence and promoting positive aging and enhance the quality of life. aging and its impact on self-identity with aging comes the accumulation of memories and experiences that can shape a person’s sense of self and identity. as individuals age, they are more likely to experience a decline in

a sense of nostalgia or sentimentality. this process of reminiscing is not only a natural and common aspect of human life, but it can also play a significant role in promoting mental health and well-being. as it is a natural human tendency to look back on the events and experiences that have shaped our lives, reminiscence offers a way to make sense of our past and present. it can involve reflecting on happy or difficult memories, people who have influenced our lives, or significant events that have occurred. reminiscence can take many forms, from storytelling to looking through old

pleasant memories, processing unresolved emotions, or enhancing personal identity and social connections. it involves reflecting on personal narratives, stories, and experiences that hold significance and meaning to an individual, regardless of whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. in the context of aging and elderly care, reminiscence therapy is often used as a form of intervention to promote mental and emotional wellbeing, as well as to mitigate the effects of cognitive decline and social isolation. one of the earliest definitions of reminiscence was given by william james in his book, “the principles of psychology” (1890). he defined reminiscence as “the act of remembering or recalling past experiences, events, or memories.” since then, several psychologists have expanded on this definition and have studied the phenomenon of reminiscence in various contexts, such as in the elderly, in therapy, and in cultural contexts. reminiscence has been recognized as an important aspect of psychological well-being, particularly for older adults. engaging in reminiscence can help individuals to preserve their identity, establish meaning and purpose in life, and promote a sense of continuity across their lifespan. for individuals facing the challenges of aging, such as declining physical health, social isolation, and loss of independence, reminiscence can be a source of comfort and solace. it can also help to promote social connections and facilitate intergenerational communication and understanding. reminiscence has gained attention in recent years as a therapeutic intervention for older adults. studies have shown that reminiscence therapy can be effective in improving cognitive functioning, reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and enhancing the quality of life. reminiscence interventions have taken many forms, including life review therapy, guided autobiography, and memory work. these interventions often draw on the principles of narrative therapy, which recognizes the power of storytelling in shaping our lives and sense of self. importance of reminiscence in the elderly reminiscence has been found to have significant impacts on psychological well-being, social connectedness, and even physical health among older adults. additionally, reminiscence can be a powerful tool for preserving cultural and personal histories, fostering intergenerational relationships, and promoting feelings of meaning and purpose in life. moreover, reminiscence interventions have been developed and tested in various contexts, such as in long-term care facilities, community settings, and individual 73 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ therapy. by examining the effects of reminiscence on these outcomes, researchers can contribute to the development of effective interventions that can enhance the well-being of older adults. therefore, focusing on reminiscence as a variable of interest in a study can provide valuable insights into the role of this process in promoting positive outcomes for older adults, and may contribute to the development of effective interventions to improve their quality of life. however, studying the impact of reminiscence on mental health and well-being has been a particular focus in gerontology research. this is because the process of aging can be accompanied by numerous challenges, such as declines in physical and cognitive abilities, social isolation, and the loss of loved ones. these challenges can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and diminished self-worth. importance of reminiscence for psychological well-being reminiscence has been found to be a particularly effective tool for older adults in promoting psychological well-being, as it can help them process and come to terms with these challenges, while also fostering a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. for example, reminiscing about past accomplishments and relationships can help older adults maintain a positive self-image, while recalling past struggles and how they overcame them can promote a sense of resilience and self-efficacy. additionally, reminiscing about positive experiences can lead to increased positive affect and decreased negative affect, which can improve overall mood and quality of life. according to a systematic review of reminiscence therapy by pinquart and forstmeier (2012), the majority of studies on reminiscence therapy have been conducted with elderly populations, particularly those in residential care settings. in a study by webster and haight (2017), the authors reviewed research on reminiscence across the lifespan and found that most studies have focused on older adults. a review of research on reminiscence in the context of psychotherapy by staudinger and colleagues (2015) found that the majority of studies have focused on older adults, with only a small number of studies examining reminiscence in younger populations. a study by maercker and colleagues (2016) found that while reminiscence has been found to be a valuable tool for promoting mental health and well-being across the lifespan, the majority of studies have focused on older adults. given the unique challenges that older adults face, studying the impact of reminiscence on their mental health and well-being can provide valuable insights into how to support this population. by understanding the mechanisms through which reminiscence promotes psychological well-being, researchers and practitioners can develop interventions that leverage this process to improve the lives of older adults. thus, while reminiscence may be a relevant variable to study across different age groups, focusing on its impact on older adults can provide important insights into how to promote healthy aging. wellbeing models in relation to elderly reminiscence there are several models of wellbeing that have been studied in relation to their impact on reminiscence in the elderly population. models such as the self-determination theory, the ryff and singer model of psychological well-being, and the multidimensional model of well-being etc have also been shown to have positive effects on reminiscence in the elderly. these models focus on different aspects of wellbeing such as autonomy, personal growth, self-acceptance, purpose in life, and positive relationships, and 74 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ offer different approaches to promoting reminiscence in the elderly. understanding the strengths and limitations of different models of wellbeing can help researchers and practitioners design more effective interventions to promote wellbeing and enhance quality of life in the elderly population. a) the self-determination theory (sdt) is a model of motivation and personality that emphasizes the importance of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. according to the sdt, when individuals feel a sense of autonomy and control over their lives, they are more likely to engage in activities that promote positive psychological outcomes, such as reminiscing about their life experiences. research has shown that the sdt model is associated with greater reminiscence and wellbeing in elderly individuals. b) the ryff and singer model of psychological well-being (pwbm) is a multidimensional model that focuses on six dimensions of psychological wellbeing: autonomy, personal growth, self-acceptance, purpose in life, positive relationships, and environmental mastery. the model suggests that a balance across these dimensions can lead to overall psychological wellbeing, including the promotion of reminiscence in elderly individuals. studies have shown that individuals who have higher levels of psychological wellbeing, as measured by the pwbm, tend to have more positive attitudes towards reminiscence. c) the multidimensional model of well-being (mmwb) is another model that highlights the importance of multiple dimensions of wellbeing, including physical, social, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. the mmwb suggests that interventions designed to promote wellbeing should target multiple dimensions to achieve optimal outcomes. research has shown that interventions based on the mmwb can lead to improved reminiscence and psychological wellbeing in the elderly population. d) the “guided autobiography” model: in a study by wang and colleagues (2019), the authors used the guided autobiography model to promote reminiscence in older adults. the intervention involved a series of guided sessions where participants were encouraged to write about their life experiences. the authors found that the intervention led to significant improvements in well-being and life satisfaction. e) the “life review” model: in a study by pinquart and forstmeier (2012), the authors reviewed studies on the effectiveness of life review interventions in promoting reminiscence in older adults. they found that life review interventions were effective in improving mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. f) the “autobiographical memory specificity training” model: in a study by renner and colleagues (2017), the authors used autobiographical memory specificity training to promote reminiscence in older adults with depression. the intervention involved training participants to recall specific memories from their past, rather than general memories. the authors found that the intervention led to significant reductions in depression symptoms. g) the “positive reminiscence” model: in a study by wildschut and colleagues (2016), the authors examined the effectiveness of a positive reminiscence intervention in promoting well-being in older adults. the intervention involved recalling positive memories and sharing them with others. the authors found that the intervention led to significant improvements in well-being, particularly in terms of positive affect and life satisfaction. 75 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ overall, these studies suggest that a variety of models can be effective in promoting reminiscence in the elderly population. these models may involve different techniques, such as guided writing, life review, autobiographical memory specificity training, or positive reminiscence. by understanding the strengths and limitations of these different models, researchers and practitioners can develop interventions that are tailored to the needs and preferences of older adults, promoting their mental health and well-being. in recent years, researchers have been exploring the impact of the perma model on various populations, including the elderly. one area of particular interest has been the impact of the perma model on reminiscence among the elderly. the perma model of wellbeing the perma model of well-being is a framework developed by psychologist martin seligman that outlines five key elements of well-being: positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. there is evidence to suggest that this model can be effective in promoting reminiscence in the elderly population. here are a few ways in which the perma model may be particularly effective in this context: positive emotion: the positive emotion element of the perma model emphasizes the importance of experiencing positive emotions, such as joy, gratitude, and contentment. in the context of reminiscence, focusing on positive memories and emotions can help older adults to feel more positive about their lives and experiences. for example, a reminiscence program that encourages participants to share positive memories and experiences with one another may be particularly effective in promoting positive emotion and well-being in older adults. engagement: the engagement element of the perma model emphasizes the importance of being fully engaged and absorbed in activities that are meaningful and enjoyable. in the context of reminiscence, this might involve encouraging older adults to engage in activities that are personally meaningful to them, such as writing their life story or participating in group reminiscence sessions. by promoting engagement and involvement in these activities, the perma model may be particularly effective in promoting reminiscence in older adults. relationships: the relationships element of the perma model emphasizes the importance of social connections and positive relationships. in the context of reminiscence, focusing on relationships may involve encouraging older adults to share their memories and experiences with others, fostering a sense of connection and community. this can help to reduce social isolation and promote well-being in older adults. meaning: the meaning element of the perma model emphasizes the importance of finding meaning and purpose in life. in the context of reminiscence, this might involve encouraging older adults to reflect on the meaning and significance of their life experiences, and to find ways to integrate these experiences into their sense of self and identity. by promoting a sense of meaning and purpose, the perma model may be particularly effective in promoting well-being and positive outcomes in older adults. accomplishments: accomplishments refer to the sense of achievement and mastery that comes from working towards and achieving goals. in the context of reminiscence, accomplishments may refer to reflecting on past achievements and successes, as well as the challenges and obstacles that were overcome to achieve these accomplishments. by focusing on accomplishments, reminiscence can provide a sense of meaning and purpose to individuals, particularly those in the later stages of life who may be reflecting on their life’s work and legacy. 76 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ focus of the study on reminiscence as a variable in perma model there have been several research studies that have compared the effectiveness of different models of well-being with the perma model, with a particular focus on the impact of these models on reminiscence in the elderly. here are a few examples: in a study by zhou and colleagues (2021), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “holistic wellness” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions. in a study by kalaw and colleagues (2020), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “meaningful life” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in reducing depression symptoms. in a study by otero-lopez and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “authentic happiness” model in promoting reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in improving well-being outcomes such as life satisfaction and happiness. in a study by ng and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “self-determination theory” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions. in a study by schuurmans and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “self-compassion” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults with depression. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reducing depression symptoms, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions. in a study by kühner and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “vitality” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in reducing depression symptoms. in a study by huang and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “resilience” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults with chronic illness. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions. in a study by pinto and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “meaning in life” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions. in a study by yang and colleagues (2019), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “acceptance and commitment therapy” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults with depression. the study found that both models were effective in promoting wellbeing and reducing depression symptoms, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions. in a study by li and colleagues (2018), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “cognitive-behavioral” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults with 77 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ depression. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reducing depression symptoms, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions and reducing negative emotions. in a study by wang and colleagues (2018), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “resilience” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults with chronic pain. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions and reducing negative emotions. in a study by jiang and colleagues (2018), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “mindfulness-based stress reduction” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in a study by luo and colleagues (2017), the authors compared the effectiveness of the perma model with the “flourishing” model in promoting well-being and reminiscence in older adults. the study found that both models were effective in promoting well-being and reminiscence, but that the perma model was more effective in promoting positive emotions and reducing negative emotions. thus, it can be said that perma model of well-being may be effective in promoting reminiscence in the elderly population by emphasizing key elements such as positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishments. by tailoring reminiscence interventions to focus on these elements, researchers and practitioners may be able to promote mental health and well-being in older adults. huta and ryan (2010) conducted a study to investigate the differential effects of hedonic and eudemonic motives on well-being. they found that both types of motives were positively associated with well-being, but that eudemonic motives had a stronger and more lasting impact. eudemonic motives are those that relate to a sense of meaning and purpose, while hedonic motives are focused on pleasure and enjoyment. application of the perma model in enhancing reminiscence in the elderly several studies have explored the relationship between the perma model and reminiscence in the elderly population. lam, wong, and law (2015) investigated the impact of a life review intervention using guided autobiography on the reminiscence of community-dwelling elderly adults. the pilot study included 30 participants aged 60 and above who were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. the intervention group received eight weekly 2-hour sessions of guided autobiography, which aimed to facilitate the participants’ reflection on their past experiences and achievements using prompts and feedback from group members. the control group received no intervention. the study found that the intervention group showed significant improvement in reminiscence, as measured by the reminiscence functions scale (rfs), compared to the control group. the rfs measures the extent to which individuals use reminiscence for different functions, such as resolving conflicts or maintaining self-identity. the intervention group also reported significantly higher levels of positive emotion, engagement, and meaning in life, as measured by the positive and negative affect schedule and the life engagement test. the results of this pilot study suggest that a life review intervention using guided autobiography based on the perma model can have a positive impact on the reminiscence of community-dwelling elderly adults. the study also highlights the importance of incorporating positive psychology principles, such as the perma model, in interventions for older adults, as they can help promote well-being and enhance their quality of life. however, further research with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this intervention. 78 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ a study by zeng et al. (2019) found that older adults who reported higher levels of positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning, and achievement also reported higher levels of reminiscence. the authors suggest that the perma model provides a useful framework for understanding the factors that contribute to positive reminiscence in older adults. another study by shi et al. (2019) explored the impact of a positive reminiscence intervention based on the perma model. the intervention involved a series of group sessions in which participants were encouraged to reflect on positive experiences from their past and to identify the perma components that were present in those experiences. the results showed that participants who received the intervention reported higher levels of well-being and lower levels of depressive symptoms compared to a control group. overall, the research suggests that the perma model can be a useful framework for promoting wellbeing and enhancing reminiscence in the elderly population. by focusing on the elements of positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment, interventions can help older adults reflect on positive experiences and find meaning and purpose in their lives. this can have a positive impact on their mental and physical health, and improve their overall well-being. all things considered, the perma model of wellbeing provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing reminiscence in the elderly. the model focuses on five essential elements of wellbeing, including positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and achievement. by addressing each of these elements, the model can help seniors feel a sense of purpose, connectedness, and happiness, which can promote cognitive function and overall quality of life. several studies have suggested that interventions based on the perma model can be effective in enhancing the wellbeing of the elderly, including those with cognitive impairment. for instance, activities that promote positive emotions, such as gratitude journaling and mindfulness meditation, can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. similarly, activities that foster engagement, such as hobbies and games, can improve cognitive function and enhance social connections. conclusion despite the promising findings, there are some limitations to using the perma model in the elderly population. for instance, the model may not be suitable for seniors who have severe cognitive impairment or advanced stages of dementia. additionally, some of the activities that promote wellbeing may not be accessible or enjoyable for all seniors, depending on their interests and abilities. moving forward, future research should focus on developing more personalized interventions based on the perma model that can be tailored to individual needs and preferences. this could involve using technology such as virtual reality to create immersive and interactive reminiscence experiences that promote engagement and meaningful connections. to sum up, the perma model of wellbeing provides a valuable framework for enhancing reminiscence in the elderly. by promoting positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and achievement, the model can help seniors feel a sense of purpose, connectedness, and happiness. while there are some limitations to using the model, future research should focus on developing more personalized interventions that can be tailored to individual needs and preferences. ultimately, by promoting wellbeing in the elderly, we can help them live more fulfilling and meaningful lives. 79 the perma model of wellbeing ﻿ references bohlmeijer, e., lamers, s. m. a., & fledderus, m.

ii) improving general endurance and cardiovascular capacity; iii) optimizing flexibility, balance, and motor coordination, and iv) prevent the onset of joint and muscle injuries. the second phase: includes the fundamental part of the physical exercises and activities to be carried out. finally, the third phase: includes the “return to calm” part, where some stretching exercises are proposed, so that participants gradually recover from the positive effects of the physical activity session and reflect on it. considering the scarcity of studies and the known specialized literature on this matter, we substantiate our program in the references that embody the present chapter, mainly the works that emerge from the portuguese authors - gonçalo dias and rui mendes, with manifest notoriety and publications internationally. physical activity for older people physical activity is relevant for older people, especially in the treatment of vascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension, among other pathologies (dias & mendes, 2013, 2014, 2015). thus, a physical activity program for older people can include the following recommendations (dias, felício, & mendes, 2015; dias, mendes, & vasconcelos, 2016; dias & couceiro, 2017; dias, mendes, & almeida 2017; santos-rocha, francisco, ribeiro & lemos, 2023): 1. exercise intensity should be low/moderate; 2. physical exercise should not be applied if the elderly person manifests exhaustion and/or pain; 3. it is not recommended to exceed the maximum range of motion; 4. fast and sudden exercises should be avoided; 5. the recreational component (e.g., games, songs, and traditional dances) can complement the session; 84 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ 6. requesting the anaerobic system is not recommended, giving priority to work involving the aerobic pathways; 7. the use of medication must be cautious. characteristics of the physical activity program for older people a physical activity program for older people implies knowing the limitations inherent to age and psychomotor needs (dias & couceiro, 2017; santos, francisco, ribeiro & lemos, 2023). on this basis, we present the methodology and application of this program, which can be adapted to the elderly, depending on their morphological and functional characteristics (cf. table 1). phase i - joint and organic mobilization objectives of joint and organic mobilization (table 2): 1. adapt the organism to the performance of physical activity; 2. decrease the risk of muscular injuries. elderly people who can walk and are in good health, especially in terms of cardiorespiratory function and balance, can perform these and the following exercises in a standing position. table 1. review and proposal adapted from dias, mendes, and serra e silva (2014); dias, mendes, serra e silva and braquinho (2015); dias, mendes, and mendes (2015) and dias and couceiro (2017) 1. structure 2. frequency 3. duration generally, the structure of the physical activity session includes three distinct phases: 1. initial part: joint and organic mobilization; 2. fundamental part: learning and/or performance of physical exercises; 3. final part: return to calm. on average, depending on the clinical history of each person and their health condition, the frequency of sessions can be 2 to 3 times a week, covering a 24 to 48 hours break, for rest and physical recovery. on average, depending on the clinical history of each elderly person, the duration of sessions can vary between 40 to 60 minutes of physical activity. 4. intensity 5. repetitions per exercise 6. technical indications the duration of physical activity sessions can vary between 40 to 60 minutes. in this case, we propose that the physical activity is predominantly aerobic and of low intensity or moderate intensity, where the proposed exercises are between 60% and 70% of the maximum heart rate, depending on the clinical history and health condition. this situation must be individualized and adapted to the morphological and functional characteristics of each person, depending also on their abilities. depending on the clinical history of each person and health condition, each exercise should not exceed 10 repetitions, respecting a time of 2 to 3 minutes, for recovery between series, of the same movement. at the beginning of the session, depending on the clinical history of each person and health condition, it is recommended to perform flexibility exercises, which prevent injuries to the joints, tendons, ligaments, and muscles (dias & mendes, 2015). at the end of the session, depending on the clinical history of each person and health condition, we suggest stretching, lasting 15 to 20 seconds per exercise. 85 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 2(a). exercises (1 to 7) for joint and organic mobilization – phase i 86 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 2(b).87 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 2(c).technical note: as it is a very sensitive area of the body, which can cause serious injuries, we chose not to work on the cervical area. 88 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ phase ii - physical exercises - fundamental part objective of the fundamental part of the session (table 3): 1. develop specific and varied exercises that develop the psychomotor and cardiorespiratory capacities of the elderly. phase iii - return to calm objectives of the return to calm (table 5): 2. reduce muscle and joint tension involved in physical activity; 3. provide a moment of reflection on the work developed in the session. conclusion practical implications a physical activity program for older people must consider the intensity of the exercises, avoiding sudden movements that jeopardize their physical integrity. physical activity can include a playful component, namely: games, songs, and traditional dances, among other methodologies, previously described. a physical activity program for older people implies knowing the limitations inherent to age and individual changes that must be monitored by health professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, psychologists, physical education teachers, and physiotherapists, among others). the implementation of this program depends on the psychomotor condition of each elderly person and the prescribed medical indications, and it can be complemented with other proposals (e.g., yoga, pedestrian orienteering, hydro gymnastics and cycling tourism, among others). finally, a physical activity program for older people will have to be extremely motivating, pedagogical, playful, and very well organized from a technical point of view. recommendations 1. a physical activity program for older people must respect the real psychomotor needs of older people. 2. the intensity, volume, frequency, and progression of physical exercises must be adapted to the psychomotor characteristics of each elderly person. 3. the blood pressure of the elderly should be monitored daily, preferably by health professionals. 4. we propose strict control of food, especially in terms of salt consumption. 5. finally, we recommend a battery of tests to assess the results achieved (e.g., fullerton functional fitness test (fft) battery). these recommendations are transversal to people with cognitive decline. 89 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(a). exercises for the upper limbs and trunk (1 to 20) - fundamental part - phase ii 90 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(b).91 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(c).92 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(d).93 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(e).94 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(f).95 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 3(g).96 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 4 (a). exercises for the lower limbs (1 to 9) - fundamental part – phase ii 97 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 4 (b).98 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 4 (c).pedagogical note: each exercise should not exceed 10 repetitions per body segment, respecting a time of 2 to 3 minutes for recovery between sets of the same movement (dias & couceiro, 2017). 99 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 5(a). exercises for stretching (1 to 7) - return to calm – phase iii 100 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ table 5(b).101 physical activity programs for older people ﻿ final observations 1. there is no conflict of interest between authors. 2. the images contemplated in this book were authorized by the authors that integrate it, namely: rodrigo mendes and cristiana lameira, who served as a model for the technical execution of the proposed exercises. references dias, g., & couceiro, m. s.

(2009) identified a tendency toward an association between horseback riding and stress incontinence. another study by kubota et al. (2006) concluded that mechanical horseback riding enhances insulin-induced glucose uptake in elder diabetic patients. in this context, equine-assisted therapy uses rhythmic and three-dimensional oscillations of horses to trigger neuromuscular responses. conclusively, as this type of physical activity requires the use of the entire body, it can have important contributions to the health of the elderly (janura, et al., 2009). it was decided to prepare a scoping review, guided by the methodology proposed by the joanna briggs institute (jbi) (peters et al., 2020), to systematically explore and map the evidence available in the literature on the contributions of equine-assisted therapy in the health of the elderly. such data are relevant since they can support the analysis, reflection, and investigation of the role of nurses in this context. more specifically, this review aims to answer the question: what are the contributions of horse-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly? systematic review method according to the recommendations of the joanna briggs institute (jbi) for conducting a scoping review (peters et al., 2020), the pcc strategy (participants, concept, and context) was used with the following inclusion criteria: 105 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ inclusion criteria search strategy the research strategy included studies written in english, french, spanish, and portuguese, published in the last 10 years, more specifically between september 2012 and september 2022. data were collected using the cinahl plus with full-text databases, and medline with full text, from the ebscohost platform. initially, an initial search was carried out in the databases included to analyze and group the words contained in the text of the titles and abstracts most used in the articles. in a second moment, a search was carried out in these same databases using the identified keywords and indexing terms. subsequently, the bibliographic references of the articles and studies identified were analyzed to search for and include additional studies. the search results were exported to the mendeley ® reference management software and duplicate articles were removed. then, a critical and reflective reading of the titles and abstracts of the researched articles was carried out to evaluate their relevance to the review. a careful analysis of the articles that meet the inclusion criteria, through full reading, was performed to extract the evidence related to the contributions of equine-assisted therapy on the health of the elderly. to organize the analysis, phrases, and words that corresponded to elements of interest related to models of professional nursing practice were identified and transcribed. the data extraction includes a logical and descriptive summary of the results that must be in line with the objectives and questions of the scoping review (peters et al., 2020). to systematize the information in the articles, the extracted data were descriptively compiled by two independent reviewers, using an instrument previously prepared by the authors. at all stages, the analysis of the full text of the articles was carried out by two reviewers independently, to verify the satisfaction of the defined inclusion criteria. in cases where discrepancies were found, a third reviewer was consulted for a final decision. table 1. inclusion criteria participants concept context studies that include people over 65 years of age (healthy or with a disease) studies that approach equine-assisted therapy, including simulated horseback riding studies that approach the contributions to health study design quantitative, qualitative, mixed-method studies, and literature reviews. publication language studies published in portuguese, spanish, french or english. publication date studies published between 1 september 2012 and 30 september 2022 106 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ presentation and interpretation of results to enable a mapping of the data extracted from the articles included in the review, the results of a scoping review must be presented in the form of graphs, figures, and/or tables (peters et al., 2020). in the search, 154 articles were identified, of which 24 were excluded because they were duplicates. of the remaining 130 articles, 101 were excluded after analyzing the title and abstract. subsequently, of the remaining 29 articles, 15 were excluded after reading the full text for not meeting the inclusion criteria. conclusively, 14 studies present the contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly (figure 1). figure 1. prisma flowchart (adapted): study selection process 107 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ the 14 included studies are from different regions of the globe and were published between 2013 and 2020. of these, one is european, five are asian, four are from north america and four are from south america. regarding methodology, 13 resort to quantitative methods and one uses mixed methods. the characteristics of the included studies are presented in table 2. table 2 (a). description of the included studies authors title year country methodology participants sung et al.

(2013) the control group received conventional rehabilitation for 60 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks, while the experimental group received conventional rehabilitation for 45 minutes a day followed using a hippotherapy simulator for 15 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. a hippotherapy simulator influences symmetric body weight bearing during gait in patients with stroke. this intervention stimulates trunk muscles from sit-to-stand to stand, or from stand-to-walk. therefore, it improves the shift of body weight bearing on gait. white-lewis et al. (2019) participants spent one hour each week for six weeks learning to ride a horse, starting with basics like walking around the arena and progressing to more complex tasks such as weaving through cones. stretching exercises were also done as a warm-up and human-animal bonding time was provided after riding. horse assisted therapy decreases pain and improves the range of motion and quality of life for adults and older adults with arthritis. 109 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ table 3(b).study number of sessions and duration contributions of equine-assisted therapy on the health of the elderly araujo et al. (2019) equine-assisted therapy consisted of 30-minute sessions over ten weeks (20 sessions). during the intervention, physical and cognitive exercises were increased in intensity every two weeks. physical exercises varied gait, surface, terrain, and direction to increase the intensity and sensory/ balanced inputs. cognitive exercises included memorizing and saying names, colors, and objects, as well as controlling the horse’s reins both inside and outside. the equine-assisted therapy is associated with an improvement in balance and functional capacity in older adults with alzheimer’s disease. araujo et al. (2013) hippotherapy was done for 8 weeks, with two 30-minute sessions per week, totaling 16 sessions. the intervention began with familiarization exercises for the practitioner to adapt to the horse’s movements, with an emphasis on postural awareness. this progressed to different riding positions, flexion, and abduction, with the difficulty increasing to include frontal riding on a saddle in uneven terrain with trunk rotation. exercises were finished with five minutes of stretching while standing on the horse. each individual used the same animal and guide throughout the training sessions. a horse-assisted therapy intervention, aimed at healthy elderly people, resulted in an improvement in the lower limb strength and balance in the elderly. cho (2017) the equine-assisted therapy was conducted twice a week for 12 weeks, lasting 25 minutes each session. the effect of horse-assisted therapy sessions on relative alpha power (an indicator of mental health in a stable mental state) in healthy elderly was analysed. it was concluded that horseback riding and mechanical horseback riding exercise has a positive effect on psychological stability in the elderly. kim et al. (2015) equine-assisted therapy was performed for 15 minutes, 3 times per week, over 8 weeks. the alpha power index increased significantly after horseback riding exercise. cho et al. (2015) equine-assisted therapy was performed 3 times per week for 15 minutes over 8 weeks. the study was performed on horses at the slowest walking speed (110 m/min) with an instructor leading the horse by the bridle and an assistant supporting the rider’s movement to prevent falls. horseback riding exercise is effective for improving the levels of serotonin and cortisol. bunketorp-kall et al. (2019) equine-assisted therapy involved two weekly sessions over a 12-week period. the equine-assisted therapy is associated to be an improvement in gait and functional mobility in late-phase stroke survivors. 110 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ table 3(c).study number of sessions and duration contributions of equine-assisted therapy on the health of the elderly goudy et al. (2019) participants exercised twice a week on a simulator for 60 minutes per session over six weeks. participants were asked to adopt an erect posture and exercise at a moderate intensity (5 or 6 on the borg’s modified rate of perceived exertion scale) while seated on the saddle of the simulator. the simulated horseback riding improves the balance and the cognitive impairment em elderly com parkinson. mello et al. (2020) equine-assisted therapy was done with the horse in step for 30 minutes to evaluate the effect of the three-dimensional movement provided by the horse. no other activities were done during the session. the equine-assisted therapy promotes a reduction in the myoelectric activity of the masticatory muscles of the elderly. kim et al. (2018) three expert riders evaluated the core muscle activation of three different gait speeds (walk 1⁄4 80 m/minute, slow trot 1⁄4 135 m/minute, and fast trot 1⁄4 159m/minute) using a fortis-102 simulator. the results showed similarity between hr and hrs. the experiment was performed in 15-minute blocks with 8-minute rests between each one. simulated riding can be an effective alternative to real riding to increase the muscle activation of the thigh and trunk and improve postural control and balance, as there are no significant changes in this positive effect in both methods. diniz et al. (2020) participants were involved in at least two activities, such as hydro gymnastics, swimming, dancing, and bodybuilding, twice a week, but only hippotherapy was used in place of conventional physiotherapy. ten 30-min hippotherapy sessions were conducted once a week. the person was on the saddle with their feet in the stirrups during the first 15 min and with feet off the stirrups during the last 15 min. no other activities were permitted when the elderly person was on the horse. this was the initial contact with hippotherapy for the hippotherapy group. the equine-assisted therapy is associated to an improvement of functional mobility, dynamic balance, and flexibility in elderly people. lee et al. (2020) equine-assisted intervention without horseback riding. the mental health professionals and equine specialists provided a nonriding equine-assisted psychotherapy intervention with four sessions: grooming, horse care, exercise, and lunch time conversations. the activities lasted 20–30 min each, including breaks, over six weeks. during lunch time, the facilitators encouraged participants to reminisce about horses and interactions with animals from earlier life stages. mental health professionals and equine specialists work together to ensure that clients and horses are both emotionally and physically safe during their interactions, monitoring emotions and nonverbal communication. the equine-assisted therapy promotes the social interaction in a group setting (positive influences from their peers), the relaxation in the outdoor environment and evoking positive memories. table 3(d).study number of sessions and duration contributions of equine-assisted therapy on the health of the elderly steele et al. (2018) participants in this treatment program stayed on site at an equine center for a week of therapy and experiential activities. equine-assisted intervention was a non-riding psychotherapeutic approach that used horses and a mental health professional to help clients with trauma and moral injury by using the horses’ behaviour as a metaphor. it helps clients improve problem solving, communication, attachment, trust, self-control, setting boundaries, and calming their nervous system. this 7-day intensive treatment combines eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, equine-assisted psychotherapy, yoga, and narrative writing to help individuals in a supportive community setting. an intensive intervention that combined horse-assisted therapy, reprocessing therapy, yoga, and narrative writing in the context of the community, was reflected in an improvement in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, attachment problems, moral injury, and reduced dissociative experiences. 111 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ strokes often have implications in motor, sensory, and cognitive function. these implications can permanently condition self-care; therefore, health professionals need to implement strategies that improve balance, strength, coordination, muscle tone, range of joint movement, weight-bearing, body posture, and gait in patients with neurological problems. in this sense, a study carried out in south korea sought to analyze the contribution of a hippotherapy simulator in symmetrical weight bearing in patients with stroke. the results showed that the activation of the erector spinae and the gait parameters (load response, single support, total double support, and pre-swing) in the experimental group was significantly increased compared to the control group (sung et al., 2013). still regarding people with stroke, bunketorp-kall et al. (2019) searched to analyze if equine therapy and therapy based on rhythm and music influence functional mobility in the late phase after stroke. the intervention included sessions twice a week for 12 weeks. the results point to a significant improvement in gait and functional performance in the late phase after stroke. these results partially last for six months. improving mobility is of great importance for achieving autonomy, as well as for reintegration into the community of people with stroke (bunketorp-kall et al., 2019). along with what happens with stroke, arthritis can also condition the quality of life of the elderly due to pain, stiffness, and decreased function. at this level, an intervention that included 30-minute sessions of horse-assisted therapy in people with arthritis resulted in a statistically significant improvement in back pain and range of motion for the back, hips, and shoulder six weeks after starting the intervention, probably due to the tri-rotational movement that horse-assisted therapy promotes. there was also a significant improvement in the quality-of-life aspects: affect and upper limbs (white-lewis et al., 2019). in the elderly, improvements in motor function (gait, lower limb function, and balance) may be associated with improvements in cognition (global cognition, executive function, memory, and information processing speed). in this sense, a study carried out in brazil included an intervention of horse-assisted therapy in people with alzheimer’s disease. this study intervention lasted 10 weeks and consisted of 30-minute sessions twice a week, totalizing 20 sessions. during the intervention, there was a progressive increase in the intensity of physical exercise (the trot was used to increase intense sensory and balance inputs) and cognitive exercise (memorizing and saying the name of the horse, therapists, colors, and objects during the sessions). at the end of the intervention, there were significant improvements in balance and functional capacity. lower limb muscle weakness is a predictor of falls, however, this intervention significantly increased participants’ lower limb strength and anterior-posterior balance. alzheimer’s disease leads to a gradual decline in cognition and limits the ability to perform dual-task activities, which is why the study intervention included simultaneous combinations of cognitive and physical activities. in this sense, cognitive function was evaluated, and it was verified that it did not decrease (araujo et al., 2019). another study, carried out by the same authors, included a horse-assisted therapy intervention for healthy elderly. this study intervention lasted 8 weeks and consisted of 30-minute sessions twice a week, totalizing 16 sessions. the intervention performed was effective in the improvement of functional mobility and muscle strength of the lower limbs (araujo et al., 2013). in agreement with these results, also a study carried out by diniz et al. (2020) demonstrated that horse-assisted therapy improves functional mobility, dynamic balance, and flexibility in elderly people. aging can affect the stomatognathic system, which can trigger postural imbalances. nevertheless, horse-assisted therapy can promote cervical, postural, and balance control in the elderly. a study carried out by mello et al. (2020) aimed to evaluate the effect of horse-assisted therapy in the center of gravity of the practitioner and their benefits on controlling stress by evaluating the patterns of myoelectric activ112 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ ity that affect the masticatory muscles through electromyography. the results show that horse-assisted therapy promotes a reduction in the myoelectric activity of the masticatory muscles of the elderly. the study also approaches that with each step that the horse gives, the center of gravity of the practitioner is dislocated from its midline, causing an imbalance and then causing restoration of the center of gravity. so, the vestibular system is constantly triggered. slow vestibular stimulation benefits the balance and relaxation of muscle tone throughout the body. a study performed by kim et al. (2015) also sought to analyze the effects of horseback riding exercise therapy on background electroencephalograms of elderly people. the results of this study are in line with the results of the previously mentioned study, also verifying that the relative faster alpha power index was active in all domains of the horseback riding exercise group but was suppressed in all domains of the control group. these same authors (cho et al., 2015) sought to analyze the effects of horseback riding exercise therapy on hormone levels in elderly persons, having found that cortisol and serotonin levels increased significantly in the group submitted to horseback-assisted therapy in relation to the group of control, suggesting that horseback riding exercise is effective for improving the levels of these hormones. regarding parkinson’s patients, physical exercise may be used to prevent and mitigate the symptoms. a study carried out by goudy et al. (2019) aimed to determine changes in balance, postural sway, and quality of life in people with parkinson’s. the intervention consisted of using a horseback-riding simulator to carry out 60-minute sessions twice a week for six weeks. it was concluded that simulated horseback riding is associated with an improvement in balance and cognitive impairment in elderly people with parkinson’s. once the use of simulated horseback riding was approached, a study carried out by kim et al. (2018) sought to compare muscle activation patterns in real and simulated horseback riding exercises, through surface electromyography recordings of the erector spinae, rectus abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus femoris muscles. the results indicate that simulated riding can be an effective alternative to real riding to increase the muscle activation of the thigh and trunk and improve postural control and balance because there are no significant changes between methods. in the elderly population, strategies that promote physiological and cognitive function must be accompanied by strategies that promote social functioning. in this sense, the results of a study carried out by lee et al. (2020) show that horse-assisted therapy an equine-assisted intervention without horseback riding stimulates social interaction in a group setting (positive influences from their peers), the relaxation in the outdoor environment and evoking positive memories. regarding people with post-traumatic stress disorder recovery is possible when proper treatment is implemented. for this reason, a study carried out by steele et al. (2018). aimed at implementing the trauma and resiliency resources, inc.’s warrior camp. program. this program is designed to deal with the effects of combat trauma on military service members and veterans. it consists of an intensive 7-day treatment that incorporates reprocessing therapy, equine-assisted psychotherapy, yoga, and narrative writing in a community context. the combination of these strategies significantly contributed to an improvement in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, attachment problems, moral injury, and reduced dissociative experiences. 113 contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly ﻿ conclusion the objective of this scoping review was to explore and map the available scientific evidence on the contributions of equine-assisted therapy to the health of the elderly. the limitation of this review is the exclusion of articles in other languages than portuguese, spanish, english, or french. extensive research in other databases could be important in identifying relevant results. eleven studies carried out in various regions of the world were identified, with no portuguese study identified. the analysis of the articles included in the study identified that equine-assisted therapy has had benefits in healthy elderly people, namely in increasing trunk neuromuscular activation (electromyography data), balance, flexibility, agility, coordination, and health-related quality of life. in people with alzheimer’s and parkinson’s disease, it is associated with a significant improvement in predictive fall risk factors, namely trunk balance, lower extremity muscle strength, cognitive ability, and as a result, functional capacity. it is also associated with reduced spasticity and improved mental well-being in elderly people with spinal cord injury and improved balance. in arthritis situations, it is associated with a decrease in the intensity and frequency of pain and increase of range of motion. regarding elderly mental health, it translates into increased psychological stability (electroencephalogram data), social stimulation in a group environment, relaxation, and the evocation of positive memories. in people with post-traumatic stress disorder, if combined with other strategies (yoga, narrative writing, reprocessing therapy) it can increase a sense of self-security. concomitantly, when combined with other strategies, such as music therapy, it may be associated with an improvement in the elderly’s memory. the use of riding simulators as an alternative to the use of horses is also associated with improved balance, muscle activation, and motivation. evidence shows that the use of therapy with horses or riding simulators is a strategy that promotes the physical and mental well-being of the elderly, which benefits not only healthy elderly people but also people with neuromuscular and neurosensory disorders. subsequently, their integration into therapeutic plans for the elderly should be considered by health professionals. references alanee, s., heiner, j., liu, n., & monga, m.

and care interventions for the exploration of falls prevention in practice. within the context of home care and community-based settings, being able to integrate falls prevention into the integrated care that older people receive, their ambulation, health and wellbeing, and subsequently their longevity in senior years can be extended and sustained in terms of quality and satisfaction. this chapter contextualizes and frames falls and fall injuries as a societal challenge by deconstructing the characteristic physiological processes of senescence and identifying key areas for fundamental address in the prevention of falls ‘in situ.’ the chapter focus is predominantly aligned to those processes of natural senescence aligned with normal ageing processes, alongside those pathologies which constitute abnormal pathological processes, which occur more often in older adults as a consequence of these processes of senescence. introduction with increasing numbers of older adults living beyond the age of 65 years, so too is there a corresponding increasing number of falls in the home, which constitute the most significant number of injuries in adults of this specific age group (moreland, kakara, & henry, 2020). statistical analysis reveals that the risk of falls increases exponentially with age, which can lead to potentially long-term issues and challenges with the maintenance of ambulatory wellbeing as a consequence of resultant physical disability or impairment, and consequently contributes to poorer outcomes in quality and longevity of life (tornero- quiñones et al, 2020). fatalities arising as a consequence of falls in those aged over 65 years and can be attributed to up to one third of all accidental deaths in this age group (mielenz et al, 2020). rates of mortality such as these are largely preventable in relation to those necessitating long term care within nursing home and residential care settings (drake et al, 2021). it is the normal processes of senescence, ambulatory wellbeing: perspectives on senescence in gerontology catherine hayes university of sunderland, uk 117 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ which impact on the physiological decline of ageing adults (katsuumi, 2018; faragher, 2017). being able to accommodate and account for these within complex individual physical and social care provides a sound rationale for the integration of falls prevention strategies in the overall health continuum for older adults, where modifications can be made to prevent risk of future falls (khong et al, 2017). since once an older adult has fallen once, they are statistically two thirds more likely to fall again over the next 12 months, this can be a significant means of avoiding elevated rates of morbidity and mortality in this age group (bartosch et al 2020; gazibara et al, 2017). this chapter constitutes a theoretical contribution to the gerontology of ageing, so that the target audience can potentially develop a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the physiological processes of senescence. for those professionals seeking to align strategic interventions with what is practically achievable remains one of the greatest challenges in this field of gerontology (schapmire et al, 2018; skinner, andrews, & cutchin, 2017). encouraging active and healthy processes of ageing not only benefits individual members of society, it has wider economic implications for health services, which deal with the implications of normal physiological senescence as greater numbers of older adults live into old age and, as a consequence of this, are more likely to live with morbidities which impact on their ambulatory health and wellbeing (alcañiz, & solé-auró, 2018). functional senescence is part of a normal process of physiological ageing. this encompasses the gradual deterioration of the organs and systems of the body alongside a progressively decreasing capacity for function by the body’s processes of homeostasis (he & sharpless, 2017). in terms of finality, the process of senescence leads to progressive dysfunction and eventual death. the fact that this is a normal trajectory for the ageing body also provides an insight into how disease and ageing synergistically contribute to the acceleration of death in older adults (herranz & gil, 2018). the publication of the world guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative (2022) has placed falls in the elderly as a central focus for strategic address across contemporary societies. providing an understanding of the basic physiological knowledge within the context of the process of senescence and disease, and their relevance to potential falls prevention initiatives is the overall aim of this chapter interrelationships of multi-morbidity and senescence as part of the trajectory of chronological ageing, statistical evidence provides an insight into the correlation between increasing age and increasing abnormal pathology. in this sense ageing is a natural process of physiological decline characterised by processes of physical change (tieland, trouwburst, & clark, 2018). it is these processes of the ageing process which can be attributed to the often very serious consequences of illness, which amongst their younger counterparts, may be perceived and experienced as relatively minor. comorbidities in ageing individuals are far more common in adults aged 65 years and older and these directly impact on the development, prognosis and consequent management of illness (van onna & boonen, 2016). those systems such as the neurological, vascular, respiratory and musculoskeletal systems demonstrate clear processes of degeneration with age, and as ageing progresses, pathology is statistically far more likely to present as being symptomatically atypical, meaning prompt assessment, diagnosis and management can be significantly delayed (bisdorff et al., 2013). depending on the nature of these presenting conditions, some of which may be progressive or even metastatic, in instances of cancer, this can have devastating consequences, which might otherwise have been far more treatable, if diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease process. similarly, many conditions arising in 118 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ middle age or earlier may progress to conditions which in combination with natural processes of senescence can be potentially far more serious (dodig, čepelak & pavić, 2019). indicators of pathological processes, which might ultimately impact upon holistic processes of health and wellbeing are characterised by medical histories which for example may detail those conditions which were contracted or experienced in earlier life and which are now inactive but which may have a direct impact on an older person’s capacity to cope with disease processes or indeed the degree of immune response they illicit in relation to infection (rice et al, 2017). these medical histories may also provide an insight into current disease processes which are ultimately controlled by pharmacological and lifestyle changes, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension (sciomer, 2019). in relation to this there can be an array of associated side effects of pharmacological interventions, which also mask signs and symptoms of pathologies which would benefit from early clinical diagnosis and management. the majority of these conditions can have a degree of relevance to the prevention of falls in ageing populations, since many develop slowly and can be termed progressive in terms of their degenerative impact. typical example is atherosclerosis, which necessitates regular clinical monitoring so that medication can be appropriately modified to account for different stages of pathological change. other conditions such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis can have relapsing and remitting stages, where preventative care in relation to the potential for temporary or progressive changes in ambulatory health and wellbeing can be successfully managed (briggs, thompson & conway, 2019; mankia & emery, 2019). this can have a direct impact on the overall longevity of these older adults where care interventions and preventative measures ought to be tailored to the individual needs of each (stambler, 2017). the value of interprofessional and multi-disciplinary working arrangements between medical and allied healthcare practitioners cannot be underestimated here, and the capacity of these team members to accommodate functional change in ambulatory wellbeing is invaluable in the functional physiological avoidance of falls (kenny et al, 2017). complex medical histories and falls in ageing populations of those diseases, which more commonly manifest in ageing populations, many predispose older adults to falls, even those which may have started at an earlier stage in the life course trajectory (brännström et al, 2019). in conjunction with this, the assessment, diagnosis and prompt management of conditions is made more complex by the fact that older people are far more likely to present with atypical or very non-specific signs, which are often overlooked and quite wrongly attributed to ‘old age’ (buttigieg et al, 2018). what is worthy of note here, is that there is no one specific disease state that is particular to age, although the likelihood of occurrence may increase as part of normal processes of physiological senescence. those disease states regarded as relatively minor in younger adults or children, can therefore lead to more serious outcomes for older people, especially in relation to falls when older adults are statistically far more likely to develop neurological, skeletal or vascular pathologies, all of which have a potentially direct and negative impact on the quality and longevity of life (cho et al, 2018). given that these conditions rarely exist in abstraction from one another the higher numbers of pathologies evident in older adults can complicate diagnoses and predispose them to a greater likelihood of falling (padrón- monedero et al, 2020). 119 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ functional definitions of ‘old age’ operationalising a functional definition of ‘old age’, is fraught with the danger of labelling someone on the basis of the chronology of their age, rather than their stage of functional senescence. since ageing incorporates the age-related changes of functional decline (senescence) and those processes of pathological change which ought not to be normalised, since there is the potential for them to be identified as treatable and as a consequence curable or at least manageable. the associated decline in vitality and the reduction in physiological performance at a cellular level can lead to a reduced capacity to cope with environmental stressors and a correspondingly reduced capacity to cope either physically or psychologically with processes and outcomes of disease. ageing is a slow and iterative process, which is largely variable impact at an individual level. the homogenisation that the term ‘old age’ brings to a whole generation is neither useful clinically or socially and often leads only to unintentional ageism, which directly impacts on the ability of older adults to access healthcare resources to the same extent as their younger counterparts (covey, 1992). the need for accurate diagnosis and management of pathology ought not to be secondary to the recognition and value judgement attributable to changes in the visible appearance of people and biased assumptions of their physiological or anatomical status as a consequence. what cannot be denied is that the normal ageing process leads to death and that ageing impacts on all chronologically old people to a greater or lesser extent. the progressive and gradual deterioration of functionality and a lack of capacity for regulatory homeostasis in response to external stressors ensures a steady and progressive decline. cytologically, there is a natural decline in the number of functional cells and in terms of medical assessment there is often a degree of ambiguity in relation to which cells are actually malfunctioning due to physiological change or whether these can, with any degree of confidence be attributed to the ageing process. ultimately, there is no medical intervention that can halt this process and as a consequence the optimal quality of life for patients ought sometimes to be prioritised before the extension of their longevity. this systematic vulnerability to both disease and external stressors of human physiology are what actually characterise what is traditionally attributed to ‘old age’. disease and ageing in this sense, progressively and systematically cause the acceleration in a reciprocal and irreversible process. functional anatomical changes in ageing as an integral part of the ageing process, there are distinctive anatomical changes in organs and physiological alterations that primarily lead to: • compromised neurotransmission • decrease in intellectual performance (e.g., leading to failing memory and confusion). • decreased renal perfusion • deterioration of special senses (e.g., leading to poor vision and loss of hearing) • exacerbation of deformity (due to the rigidity of collagen) • poor breathing capacity • poor oxygen uptake • reduced cardiac output • reduction in movement potential 120 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ • reduction in nerve conduction velocity progressive nervous system change in ageing the sensitivity of the sympathetic receptors to circulating neurotransmitters is altered by the process of natural senescence in ageing. the greater intensity of response in the cardiac and vascular systems in older people have led to this being termed a hyperadrenergic state. in relation to a functional optimal nervous system in older years, no system demonstrates more clearly the need to remain active and to maintain a healthy lifestyle which engages capacity for ambulatory wellbeing and the prevention of falls in later life. the neurological system is dynamic in the sense that it changes throughout adulthood, but this trajectory of change increases exponentially after the age of sixty-five years. this manifests in a decreased awareness to the sensations of touch and vibration (mahbub, 2020). increasing numbers of neurofibrillary tangles which develop within nerve cell bodies as a consequence of ageing are evident in the hippocampus. this is seen across all older people but to an even greater extent in those patients living with dementia. those who have dementia have an increased number of neuritic or senile plaques, which have come to characterise the anatomical and physiological changes of alzheimer’s disease (sengoku, 2020). senile plaques are thickened masses of degenerating neurites (constituted of small axons, some dendrites, astrocytes) with an amyloid (starchy glycoprotein) deposit in the centre. plaques most commonly occur as a result of pathological ageing, as in alzheimer’s disease, although they have also been frequently observed in normal ageing, beginning in the fifth decade of life (sharma et al, 2020). from the perspective of biochemistry, the decrease in enzymes actively involved in processes of neurotransmitter synthesis has been recorded alongside a diminishing number of receptor sites or transmitters within the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. the reduction in motor system functionality is linked to the progressive decrease of dopamine uptake sites, which can be directly attributed to the loss of axons in basal ganglia pathways as part of age-related change. higher order association areas lose a greater number of neurons than the primary motor or visual cortex during the process of ageing, which has led to theories of how forgetfulness develops in older adulthood. even a minor degree of neuron loss and decline in the capacity of dendrites to produce new spines has an impact. whilst structural losses can be attributed to age related decline, which is also associated with processes of synaptic remodelling. this is closely linked to an overall decrease in sensory perception, alongside the presence of arteriosclerosis. the functional implications of these changes all impact on the reaction time of older people. these processes are often attributed to the overall slowing of reaction time and the process of voluntary motor movement. linked to physiological changes in muscles, this is another clear indicator of the need for older people to maintain a degree of physical fitness, which contributes to the maintenance of optimal reaction time in old people (toots et al, 2019). exercise in itself is not proven to significantly improve reaction time though, since movement slowness is related to change in neural pathways rather than to the extent of muscle health alone. reaction time can basically be defined as the length of time between stimulation and the motor response effected by it. it is also associated with nerve conduction velocity. in terms of growth and development at the other end of life’s trajectory, reaction time progressively improves as a child develops more complex and developed motor skills. scientific studies of complex reaction time detail that in research where there is a choice between two responses, that as the task becomes progressively more complex, then reaction time increases in line with the increasing age of 121 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ the study participant. the complex neurological processes involved in maintaining balance, mean that the individual risk of falls is exponentially higher in relation to their age, and this is accompanied by a variable change in reaction times during progressive ageing once people reach the age of 60 years. in the prevention of falls, older patients typically may be living with a number of chronic disease states, for which they may be taking an equal number of medications. these systemic issues are predisposing factors to falling, which have a wider impact than just that of the individual who experiences them. despite this, the chronologically aged ought never to be regarded as an indistinguishable category of personhood for whom there is minimal potential for the prevention of falls or systemic deterioration. the role of the health and social care multi-disciplinary team is invaluable in fulfilling this in the most optimal manner possible for the elderly. functional cognitive abilities the synergistic relationship between the sensory and motor system is the basis for theories of intelligence, where cognition can be defined as the process of knowing and intelligence pertains to the application of knowledge (sari et al, 2020). cognitive processes specifically include: • attention • decision making. • learning • problem solving • reasoning without a degree of cognitive ability, negotiating the process of human ambulation is impossible and movement development is completely diminished. it is the nervous system which is responsible for cognition via the processing of thought and memory, where memories can be classified according to whether they are immediate, short or long term in duration. whereas declarative memory entails the immediacy of memory, which may only last seconds or at most minutes, longer term memories can be recalled years later as they result in structural changes to the synapses that have a long-lasting impact on signal conduction pathways. ageing ensures an active decrease in capacity to undertake complex cognitive skills which involve memory. in those adults who are living with movement decline, it is also exceptionally important to consider their potential for change in memory ability. alongside these considerations, are considerations of what are termed either fluid or crystallised intelligence. whereas fluid intelligence pertains to the logical capacity to form novel associations, and can be readily measured via tests of reaction time and memory, crystallised intelligence is linked to experience and the learning associated with it. whereas fluid intelligence peaks early in the second decade and then diminishes, crystal intelligence forms the basis of wisdom and is deemed to increase with time. the reason why some adults remain alert and active mentally and others disengage or show signs of dementia still remains largely unknown and highlights the need for further research, which inevitably will impact on the field of falls prevention research. 122 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ sensory deficits motor activity in adulthood is guided by the sensory ability developed during adolescence. decline in sensory function begins in adulthood and is progressive in nature. it is important that these may or may not link to a general decline in function and not necessarily all people experience them. from a somatic perspective, some ageing adults demonstrate a clearly diminished ability to effectively detect touch, vibration, temperature, and pain (borzuola et al, 2020). the largest of the body’s sense organs, the skin undergoes distinctive changes with ageing. from a structural perspective, the growth rate of the skin and its capacity to regulate temperature, injury response and to undertake growth diminish. whilst extremes of temperature can be readily detected by older adults, their capacity to detect subtle temperature change is diminished. the sympathetic nervous system controls the degree of vasoconstriction and vasodilation to the skin and this is also impaired. pain perception is still not fully understood in relation to the ageing process. whilst deep pain diminishes with age, as yet research reports both an increase and a decrease in superficial pain sensitivity. what is abundantly clear, however, is the degree of vibrationary sensation diminishment which occurs in older adults usually starting at around the age of 50 but mainly in the feet and legs. the decline in sense of where joint positions are in space declines more evidently in women, particularly in relation to static joint position sensation at the knee joint, which may or may not be attributable to the functional impact of a gynaecoid pelvic girdle and the position the knees relative to the hips, but this has not yet been proven (maitre et al, 2013). this can impair balance and may contribute to the increased incidence of reported falls in elderly women, which is a significant aetiological factor in all-cause mortality and morbidity. motor deficits the incidence of vertigo and dizziness are very common presentations in general practice in patients aged over 50 years. the vestibular system and in particular hair cells are demonstrably degenerating with the consequent symptomology of dizziness. in relation to the vestibular nerve, by the time a person reaches the age of 75 years, the overall amount of myelinated nerve fibres has been reduced to just 60% (liu et al, 2017). because of this, reliance on the vestibular system alone can result in falls, an important consideration in falls prevention strategies. healthy older people with less of a degree of sensory deficit, have less of a degree of postural sway than those who do and as a consequence are far less likely to fall. ocular changes with a general increase in visual acuity increases in the twenties and thirties, which remains largely unaltered through to the forties and then declines, it is notable that by the age of 85 years there is an 80% less of visual acuity (saftari & kwon, 2018). it is the anatomical structural changes in the eye, which contribute to the apparent functional change. accompanying processes of ageing, central vision may be impacted upon by the development of cataracts, which cause alteration of the lens. by the time people reach the age of 65, it is estimated that 60% of all people have a general reduction in their lens transparency (donaldson et al, 2017). cases of cataracts are more common in patients living with diabetes mellitus. 123 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ visual change in relation to the potential of falls progressively the eye yellows due to the functional ageing process (saftari & kwon, 2018). the overall pupil size decreases and less light can enter the eye. by the time a person reaches the age of 60 years, the pupil has declined in size by at least 33%, with the resultant outcome that older people are far less likely to be able to detect low levels of light (wolffsohn & davies, 2019). if light becomes scattered over more of the retinal surface, then this results in glare. this glare then introduces external sources of light into the eye and because of retinal sensitivity loss, sudden flashes of light from headlights can transiently overstimulate the eyes. alongside these manifestations, the contrast sensitivity and processes of adaptation to the dark decline dramatically with age. the loss of contrast sensitivity causes a loss of perception of depth, a major cause of falls on dark staircases and consequently a major aetiological factor in the increased incidence and prevalence rate of falls in the elderly (rubiño et al, 2020). whereas an adolescent might have functional adjustment to the dark in less than seven minutes, an 80 year old’s eyes may well take up to forty (wang, hiang & chen, 2020). the gradual and progressive thickening of the lens and a consequent inability to focus is called presbyopia. with progressing age, from 40 onwards, there may be issues with adjustment from near sighted positions to long sighted perspectives. this can have important ramifications in being able to judge functional distance and can have an impact on falls and consequently falls prevention, where regular eye tests and the prescription of lenses for spectacles, where necessary, can be addressed. when there is a lack of functional capacity to adapt to change altogether, usually at the age of 60 or above, the person is said to have presbyopia (mordi & ciuffreda, 1998). whilst not especially relevant to the context of falls prevention, it is also important to remember the changes in hearing acuity, which occur as a consequence of the ageing process as an integral part of functional senescence. it is usually high frequency tones, which are first affected but the capacity for speech is less impacted upon, since speech is heard at a lower sound frequency, although in instances of presbycusis, there might also be issues with speech processing and discrimination. this lack of discriminatory ability has more of a functional impact than hearing loss alone. over 75% of all adults aged over the age of 75 years will experience this to a certain extent (ibid, 1998). other associated sensory losses are in relation to the perceptions of taste and smell. it is pressure detection on the tongue which progressively alters, rather than tastebud functional decline, which is widely reported. odour intensity detection capacity also decreases with age. there may also be issues of memory distortion and changes in relation to the psychology of eating, which impact on the perception of flavour and consequently the appeal of food for older people (locher et al, 2009). adjustment to environmental context and setting it is the modification of motor behaviour, which has the greatest impact in the consideration of the aetiological prevention of falls. this can impact directly, along with musculoskeletal change on the capacity of people to remain mobile on uneven terrain or in situations or environments with which they are unfamiliar (lee & ailshire, 2020). sometimes older adults then need to use walking sticks or zimmerframes, which can have an impact on self-image, as well as curtailing capacity for the individual movements they are capable of (bertrand et al, 2017). personality also impacts upon older peoples’ perceptions of themselves in terms of their individuality and the homogenisation they sometimes feel as they are classified on the 124 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ basis of their chronological age. this can also impact on their hesitancy to use aids to walking, which may be perceived as the preserve of the ‘old aged’ (canada et al, 2020). functional adaptations to mobility in ageing reaction time is commonly used to tangibly measure the capacity of an individual’s central nervous system to pre-empt, initiate and sustain movement (woo, shin & park, 2020). it has been found that in people aged 50 to 90 there is a directly linear increase in the time needed to plan for precise movements of the distal extremities. whilst there is no universally accepted definition of fitness, and this is as individual as everyone alive, there are some very general definitions, which describe fitness as a state of optimal wellbeing and the capacity to successfully meet the present and potential physical challenges of life. this has obvious implications during the process of ageing and consequently senescence. to be fit, therefore, is to be adapted, adjusted, qualified or suited to some purpose, function or aim. ‘fit’ also describes a person in good physical condition, or ‘healthy’. physical fitness allows one, regardless of their age, to carry out daily tasks with a degree of alertness, without any sense of undue fatigue and with remaining energy to enjoy leisurely activities as well as being deliberately productive (gadelha, 2018). factors influencing health and fitness in ageing various additional variables out with chronological age can impact on relative fitness levels, such as growth and gender (rea, 2017). what is clear, however, is that the capacity to undertake physical tasks iteratively declines with increasing age. whilst this decline is primarily attributable to physical changes of senescence it is also evident that social and environmental factors are also greatly influential. this may be due to the decreased level of physical activity that older adults partake exercise performance levels can also be unduly influenced by environmental factors such as levels of pollution and air quality. social factors impacting on processes of ageing as well as the concept of longevity, social determinants of health have a great impact on the overall quality of lives lived, in contemporary society, namely: • educational opportunity – which provides a mechanism which people can become upwardly socially mobile and in turn be empowered and inspired to maintain a standard of living associated with positive health and wellbeing choices (breen & müller, 2020). • emergent technologies – which have ensured an access to both knowledge and the capacity to communicate never experienced prior to now. • public safety – which ensures that societal protection is evident in relation to the overall health and wellbeing of citizens and which can positively impact on quality of life and wellbeing (prince et al, 2015). 125 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ • social norms and attitudes, such as discrimination – being able to empower and provide a voice to what have been perceived as the most vulnerable members of society via democracy has enabled millions of people to live longer, more productive and healthier lives, instead of the oppression caused by discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race or religion (burnes, 2019). • social order – which impacts on the capacity of all people to live in areas that have a tangibly lower degree of exposure to crime, violence, and social disorder, all of which can make a radical difference to perceived and actual health and wellbeing status (baumann et al, 2020). • social support and social interactions characterise human behaviour – in instances where people do not have these, they are at an increasingly greater risk of the development of anxiety and depression, which can have a cumulative and long term impact on perceptions and lived experiences of health and wellbeing (briggs, kennelly & kenny, 2018). • socio-economics – the impact of available finances obviously impacts on the ability of people to access a regular income and to sustain a level of living that is commensurate with positive health and wellbeing (petrovic, 2018). • transport infrastructure – being able to have access to travel, being able to drive and having access to transport both enhance quality of life and achievable life experience. in some instances, this can also impact on the access to healthcare resources that people have, which can have a great impact on their capacity to regularly attend appointments or ensure their general health is optimal (johnson et al, 2017). progressive developmental change in vascular system ageing structural anatomical changes become evident in the heart, valves, and vasculature with natural processes of ageing and normal senescence (laina, stellos & stamatelopoulos, 2018). within both the endocardium and the myocardium, elastic tissue, fat and collagen increase in the endocardium and myocardium of the heart, the outcome of which is a stiffer and far less compliant ventricular system (ibid, 2018). there is also an increased incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities in the hears of older adults, with a demonstrable decrease beyond the age of 60 years of cells in the sinoatrial node (nishijima et al, 2018). accompanying this, the valves become progressively thicker and more calcified, and this impacts on the closure and overall efficiency of the cardiac valves (ibid, 2018). the proximal arteries tend to dilate in parallel with increasing chronological age (singam, fine, & fleg, 2020). the increased amount of connective tissue and lipid deposition leads to a progressive thickening of the blood vessels. the consequent outcomes of this are an increase in vascular rigidity and a reduction in vascular compliance. within the cardiovascular system there are also notable changes in relation to ageing, which are not immediately apparent during rest. the increases at rest of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure can be attributed to the increased stiffness of the vascular system and decreased size of the peripheral vascular bed. the compliance and elastic recoil of the pulmonary system are impacted upon by processes of natural senescence too, making it harder for respiratory muscles to move air into the system (romano & romano, 2020). the most evident being: 126 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ • increased anterior-posterior diameter of the thorax • increased rigidity of the bronchioles • increased stiffness of the chest wall • structural changes in the elastic fibres of the lungs. • thickening of the mucous layer of the lungs • thoracic ankylosis and kyphosis as a consequence of these changes, residual volume increases since more air is actively retained within the lungs. the amount of inspiratory reserve, expiratory reserve and vital capacity is reduced during both rest and active states. alongside this, the surface area available for gas exchange also decreases due to changes in the function of the alveoli and substantial decrease in the number of pulmonary capillaries. responses to ventilation in relation to increased levels of carbon dioxide or reduced levels of oxygen are also attributable to receptor, muscular or neuronal change. ventilatory response in the elderly differs in older people can often be an indicator of exercise tolerance levels. there is evidence to suggest that training can effectively improve the changes in lung function which have been attributed to age (seixas, 2020). older adults are generally happy with their level of fitness but underestimate their ability to exercise. as a consequence of this, they are less inclined to engage in exercise that is challenging to them, which again can have an impact in terms of how they react to exercise (heiestad, gjestvang, & haakstad, 2020). as a consequence, this can place more physiological pressure on already vulnerable systems. where this develops to the worst extent older people may not be able to continue their daily activities of living with a functional state of dependency ensuing. visual indicators of ageing the gradual progression of grey and thinning hair, accompanied by skin wrinkling and decreased muscle tone and increasing fatty deposits, typically characterises old age. physiologically comparable is the gradual deteriorating response to environmental stressors, with renal and digestive functionality progressively diminishing (baker & blakely, 2017. the functional response of the body to temperature regulation, dietary intake and oxygen supply means that the maintenance of a constant internal environment is more physiologically challenging. alongside the progressive decline in the sheer number of cells older adults have, there is also a diminished functionality of those that remain. beyond the context of the cells themselves, the extracellular fibres also change in terms of their quality, optimal strength and overall number. the arterial walls harden and there is an increased incidence of arteriosclerosis. this is primarily attributable to the thickening of elastin and the uptake of calcium across the cell membrane, which causes the characteristic thickening and hardening of the condition. processes of mitosis become progressively reduced and diminished leading to the production of fewer replacement cells in the heart, bones and muscles (ibid, 2017). in relation to the prevention of falls, these physiological changes are contributors to the physiological vulnerability of older people. particularly where older adults develop more general issues in relation to their ambulatory health and wellbeing, where chronological age increases, the incidence of falls also exponentially increases. in relation to generalised pathological and age-related change in the feet and lower limbs. the likelihood of tissue breakdown in the foot and lower limb is increased by ischaemia 127 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ and peripheral oedema (muchna et al, 2018). healing can be further impaired by poor dietary intake, avitaminosis and poor tissue perfusion. elderly people are more prone to develop neoplastic disease, as the incidence of neoplasm increases with advancing age. the disease state in the elderly is predominantly one of multisystem pathologies, many of which will be chronic degenerative processes that impair healing and negatively impact on the individual’s overall wellbeing. overall constitutional deterioration predisposes older adults to the development of pneumonia, particularly in those cases where they have been confined to bed for a prolonged period or in instances where there is a concomitant decreased cardiac or pulmonary function or respiratory infection (focillo, 2020). as a clinical outcome, pneumonia is also a common and frequently fatal complication following the occurrence of cardiovascular accident (cva) or hip fracture, where major orthopaedic intervention is required and prolonged periods of immobilisation occur. since generalised arteriosclerosis is more common in elderly patients, there can be extensive pathological change to the renal, coronary and cerebral vessels, resulting in pulmonary and peripheral oedema (ungvari, 2018). falls in the elderly: the functional physiology the physiological impact of falls in the elderly can also lead to what is commonly known as ‘post-fall syndrome’ (meyer et al, 2020). this leads to a reluctance to resume normal activities, stunted progress in the restoration of occupational normality and potentially anxiety and depressive episodes. the origin of these falls is often systemic in nature but can sometimes also be attributed to extraneous variables such as the external environment or the introduction of new drug therapies (musich et al, 2017). in addition to this, from an anatomical and physiological perspective the origins of falls in the elderly can emanate from dysfunction or impairment, most commonly in relation to: • connective tissue disorders • dementia • endocrine disorders • myopathies • neurological deficit • vestibular function • visual capacity the functional physiological impact of polypharmacy as incidence and prevalence rates of multi-morbidity increase, so too do rates of polypharmacy (kingston et al, 2018). polypharmacy is defined as the concomitant use of five or more medications per 24-hour period by any individual, however many older patients use considerably higher numbers of medication (delgado et al, 2020). not only are prescribed medications used to treat the clinical symptomology of recognisable pathologies, they are often used to ensure that patients can live a more bearable life in relation to their potential to experience pain, as a consequence of natural processes of degeneration, so characterised by ageing and natural senescence (veronese et al, 2017). 128 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ since older adults can develop a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics response to drugs as a consequence of increased physiological sensitivity, then they are also more likely to present with issues impacting upon their ambulatory health and wellbeing with symptoms such as dizziness (van den anker, 2018). the need to reduce the amount of drugs taken due to the fact older people have decreased liver function and as such a correspondingly decreased capacity to optimally metabolise medication also places them at increased risk of adverse drug reaction (drenth‐van maanen, wilting & jansen, 2020). typical examples of these are local anaesthetics such as lignocaine or tricyclic anti-depressants, alongside stimulants such as caffeine. systemic issues with renal clearance or renal dysfunction as part of the natural processes of senescence can also mean that drugs are not excreted effectively and remain in the system longer than they ought to – typical examples of these are those medications such as antihypertensive agents, which can directly result in postural hypotension and because of this, ambulatory unsteadiness and falls (navaratnarajah & jackson, 2017). recent research by van der velde et al (2022) reveals and addresses issues surrounding the vast complexity of balancing the need to address falls and the challenges faced within the context of gerontological care provision, across europe. added to the potential for complex dose regimen, for patients who might also have functional and/ or untreated ocular decline, then the potential for drugs to be taken which are incompatible or even completely contradicted, is increased (kim & parish, 2017). anti-hypertensive medications are not the alone as a significant drug group influencing the rate of falls in the elderly. others include minor tranquillisers, hypnotics and sedatives, all of which can instigate postural instability, another precursor to falls. considering their potential to depress central nervous system, this is hardly surprising. those medications prescribed to reduce pain and swelling for musculoskeletal pain and injury such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also have side effects of fluid retention or oedematous lower limbs accompanied by dizziness, postural instability and a predisposition to fall. postural hypotension can also be an unanticipated side effect of tricyclic antidepressants and diuretics, where blackouts, dizziness and fainting can be precursors to serious falls (pan et al, 2018). osteoporosis can be a side effect of the long-term use of systemic corticosteroids, which can also lower immunity to infection and predispose patients to an increased likelihood of falls and bone fractures (rice et al, 2017). work of the greatest significance to date for older adults is the potential for deliberate interventions posited at reducing the unnecessary prescription of medication, which within the context of polypharmacy addresses the issues of the evidence-based benefits versus risks of increased prescribing (seppala et al, 2021; seppala et al, 2022). conclusion the process of normal ageing is fraught with the potential for additional diseases which can run concurrently with abnormal pathologies, which may remain undiagnosed or undetected. all have the potential to impact on the general health and ambulatory wellbeing of older adults, which can accompany natural processes of senescence to the ultimate degenerative state of death. being able to embed a working knowledge of the functional anatomy and physiology of old age, regardless of original academic discipline or professional identity is fundamental to being able to intervene with strategies to ensure optimal safeguarding against unintentional falls. this chapter has provided only a brief introductory overview to the most common physiological and anatomical changes, alongside considerations of polypharmacy and the wider implications of co-morbidities in older people. whilst this chapter is relatively functional in 129 ambulatory wellbeing ﻿ approach to the annotation of anatomy and physiology, it ought also to be noted that beyond this underpinning knowledge, older people ought to be facilitated and empowered to share their own perceptions, needs and wants of how they wish to age and how they would prefer to live lives as fulfilling as they wish. as healthcare professionals, our privilege is to address and act on the seminally scientific facts, alongside their voices of lived experience in the co-construction of new knowledge. references academic.

gbd, 2019, 2020; who, 2015). the risk of falling increases with age, with one in three older persons over the age of 65 years falling each year (ganz & latham, 2020; james, 2020; wang, et al., 2021: who, 2021). falls can result in negative physical, psychological and social consequences, including fractures, fear of falling and reduced self-efficacy. the confluence of these sequela can lead to activity avoidance resulting in insufficient levels of physical activity, increase in daily sedentary time and decrease in functional capacity. thus, along with the typical musculoskeletal and neurophysiological changes associated with ageing, the added consequences of falls can increase the risk of future falls. thus, given population changes and the negative impact of falls there is a timely need to educate people about steps that can be taken to prevent falls. a wide range of professionals from different fields are needed to support active and successful ageing strategies for older persons. their role is to develop and implement evidence-based services for all older adults. to best respond to the needs of all older adults, a person-centred approach, involving multi/interprofessional cooperation and education, are needed. hence, individualised tailored solutions are needed to prevent, treat, care, and rehabilitate older adults so that they can live independently in their own homes or live as they wish in residential settings. students studying in the disciplines of health and social care and healthcare professionals acquire, deepen, and expand their skills and knowledge through education to meet the needs of older persons in the best possible way. in addition, older persons themselves need education to increase their knowledge to prevent harmful falls. the aim of this chapter is to describe to the reader, the role of education in falls prevention among older persons and health care professionals, and the importance of continuous education support to ensure health care professionals’ have the competencies and skills to implement effective falls prevention strategies for older persons. this chapter describes to the reader the teaching approach of falls prevention using five w’s: who-where-what-why-how. in addition, this chapter will describe a number of system level examples from the field that are focussed on preventing harmful falls among older persons. background to the problems associated with falls and ageing older persons are more susceptible to fatal falls and other serious consequences, such as wrist and hip fractures (vieira, palmer & chaves, 2016; ye et al., 2021; who, 2021). worldwide, falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths. globally each year, more than 37 million severe falls occur that warrant medical attention and approximately 684 000 people die from falls (who, 2021). older adults are at greater risk of falling, tripping, or slipping when balance and muscle strength decrease. changes in functional capacity can make it more difficult for older adults to move around their living environment, both inside their home and outside in the community. also, activities of day life can become increasingly more difficult for older adults due to a gradual change in physical, psychological, cognitive function, and socialisation. in addition,, a significant proportion of older adults have a chronic condition and or a chronic long-term disease, which can further increase a person’s risk of falling, either due to the effects of the disease or secondary consequences for example side effects of medication. it is essential that evidence-informed falls prevention education programmes consider context and thus the indirect consequences of the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic. for some time now the world has 139 preventing falls ﻿ been experiencing the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic, which has and continues to have an inordinate effect on health, wellbeing, and socialisation of older adults worldwide. in earlier phases of the pandemic and subsequently during an increase in the incidence of covid-19, older adults were advised to avoid non-essential contact and follow social distancing measures. these measures changed access to social, environmental, and healthcare supports potentially affecting physical, psychological, and mental health of older adults. the impact is evidenced in the findings from the irish longitudinal study on ageing (tilda) (ward, o’mahoney, & kenny 2021b), which included 4,000 participants aged 60 years and older living in ireland. the majority of participants reported that they did not travel to visit family members (62%) or friends (80%) and almost one quarter (22%) did not meet minimum recommended levels of physical activity during the covid-19 pandemic. restrictions in social and physical activity can result in feeling lonely and socially isolated and can also contribute to harmful falls. the cacioppo evolutionary theory of loneliness (cacioppo & cacioppo, 2018) proposes that the loss in social connectivity may lead to physiological and behavioral changes, which can contribute to a deterioration in physical and cognitive health. in the united states, hoffman et al. (2022) reported that the pandemic resulted in a significant deterioration in physical function and activity among older adults. additionally, they identified a relationship between social isolation and poorer physical function and fall-related outcomes, including falls risk and fear of falling. hence, in addition to typical changes that can occur with ageing, the pandemic had a significant detrimental effect on physical and psychosocial health of older adults, which requires consideration when designing the content and delivery of fpe and falls prevention programmes. guidelines, recommendation and toolkits when constructing the content of a falls prevention education programme it is important to incorporate current evidence-based falls prevention and management guidelines and recommendations. a plethora of national and international guidelines, recommendations and toolkits have been published on the prevention and management of falls among older adults. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published the findings from its surveillance review of the evidence supporting its guidelines on falls from 2013 supporting the need to update its guidelines (nice, 2019). subsequently, more recent evidence acknowledged discrepancies in existing practice guidelines (montero-odasso et al., 2021), which prompted the development of the recently published world guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults (montero-odasso et al., 2022). these guidelines used the modified grade system to evaluate the strength of each and quality of evidence supporting each recommendation. these global guidelines provide key evidence-based recommendations whilst also recognising that tailoring may be required to translate recommendations to differing national contexts. national examples include an updated version of the evidence-based recommendation on the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries in 2017 published by the finnish association of physiotherapists (the finnish association of physiotherapists, 2017). additionally, in finland, the finish institute for health and welfare published the ikinä-model and guidebook, based on international guidelines (panel on prevention of falls in older persons, american geriatrics society and british geriatrics society, 2011), on how to prevent falls among older persons (pajala, 2012). the aim of the guideline was to offer professionals tools to use to prevention falls, harmonise practices in the field and provide useful tools for students to learn about fall prevention strategies. the guideline is based on research evidence and enriched with practical instructions and tools for implementing fall prevention in different kinds 140 preventing falls ﻿ of environments where older persons are living. tools include how to assess fall risk as well as general and specific fall risk factors. in addition, in finland interprofessional collaboration between different organizations, evidence-based falls risk assessment tools, falls prevention programmes, and materials advising older adults on how to prevent falls are used to prevent harmful falls and rehabilitate people following a fall. older persons, healthcare and educational organisations use these methods and materials to educate professionals and students about falls prevention. (äijö et al., 2021a; äijö et al., 2021b.) in ireland, the health service executive published the strategy to prevent falls and fractures in ireland’s ageing population in 2008 (health service executive, 2008). following this, project affinity (activating falls and fracture prevention in ireland together) was set-up to increase awareness and to empower older persons, communities and health and social care providers to work together to reduce the risk and rate of falling, the severity of injuries, and to promote the best possible outcomes for people following a falls-related injury. the affinity project is a collaboration between the health service executive and the state claims agency and works in partnership with older persons’ advocacy groups such as age friendly ireland and age and opportunity. the aim is to develop a comprehensive falls and fracture prevention system that is person-centered by bringing together and integrating primary prevention, secondary prevention, and rehabilitation as well as measuring outcomes collectively (affinity, 2022). the irish affinity project built on the good work of many countries, in particular scotland and new zealand. scotland’s falls and fragility fracture prevention programme is within the national active and independent living programme (https://www.gov.scot/publications/allied-health-professionsco- creating-wellbeing-people-scotland-active-independent/pages/4/), and its recently updated falls and fracture prevention strategy: https://www.gov.scot/publications/national-falls-fracture-preventionstrategy- scotland-2019-2024/pages/6/new zealand health quality & safety commission, recently published reducing harm from falls: recommended evidence-based resources 2020, which contains clinical guidelines, systematic reviews of the literature, resources, links, toolkits and guidance for key stakeholders involved in falls prevention (health quality & safety commission new zealand 2020). to support primary care teams, they also developed the stay independent falls prevention toolkit based on the steadi falls campaign developed by the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). it included guidance on the assessment and practical management of falls risk (best practice advocacy centre new zealand, 2022). other examples include the australian commission on safety and quality in health care (acsqhc) produced three separate falls guideline documents on the prevention of falls and harm from falls in older people in the community, hospitals, and residential care facilities. thus, acknowledging both the commonalities and setting specific information required to prevent falls in the three main settings. in addition, acsqhc published useful, user-friendly factsheets (falls facts) for various stakeholders including healthcare workers and hospital staff. at european level initiatives such as the prevention of falls network for dissemination (profound, 2015), was established to increase awareness about falls and falls prevention programmes, by disseminating evidence-based resources to support implementation of best practice across europe among key stakeholders in policy and practice. fall prevention education (fpe) is one of the strategies used to reduce falls among older adults (who 2021). however, globally a uniform education design for health care professionals’ education in fpe does not exist (shaw et al., 2020). education has been delivered as either a single or part of a multifactorial intervention in many fall preventions programmes (cameron et al. 2018). most of these programmes have been developed to target the hospital environment and patients there (heng et al. 2020; 141 preventing falls ﻿ lee, pritchard, mcdermott & haines, 2014) or people who work or live-in residential care (schoberer, eglseer, halfens & lohrmann, 2018; taylor, 2015). the basic idea of education is to share and increase the level of knowledge and skills among learners. stimulating intellectual curiosity, creativity and critical thinking requires innovative and versatile pedagogical solutions. integration of different teaching and learning methods can motivate learners to develop their skills and enrich learners’ attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions (gill et al., 2019; shaw et al., 2020; tiedemann et al., 2021). in addition, older persons require tailored education to meet their needs to prevent falls. education can be implemented in different environments using a variety of methods, for example the hospital environment (shaw et al. 2023) or community-based setting. education is a component of the clinical practice guidelines on fall prevention. based on the montero- odasso et al. (2021) evaluation of fall prevention clinical practice guidelines, fifteen guidelines recommended falls prevention education, of these six guidelines provided strong recommendations and six provided weak recommendations for offering patients and caregivers education on fall prevention and management strategies. thus, montero-odasso et al. (2021) systematic review reported that agreement was high for many recommendations among fall prevention clinical practice guidelines for older adults. however, key aspects such as including stakeholder perspectives were lacking. thus, it is recommended that future guidelines include patient values and perspectives, which are a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and essential to effective implementation and uptake. who-where-what-why-how in fall prevention and education cooperation between european partners within the european partnership for active and healthy ageing (eip aha) (eip aha a2, 2021; bousquet et al., 2017), a programme of the european commission, aimed to enhance and enrich the underlying information and process care models for older persons to support the embedding of good practices and their upscaling. many examples of innovative, cross-sectoral programmes and practices were shared on how to improve older persons’ quality of life and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of health and social care systems. personalised and population-based assessments underpin care models for older persons and appear in many forms. a lreadyliz assessment refers to the monitoring and functioning of an individual’s health conditions to determine suitable and timely prevention and intervention strategies, an example being the common geriatric assessment (cga) (welsh et al., 2014; burns et al., 2004). population-based assessments relate to the health economic assessment of practices and systems in terms of outcomes, such as the monitoring and assessment framework for the european innovation partnership on active and healthy ageing (boehler & abadie, 2015; eip aha a2, 2021). the important distinctions between these two modes of assessment are outlined in eklund (2021), in which he argues for the development of a common assessment framework for active and health ageing capable of providing granular context and culture specific information and process structures; the latter needs to be done in collaboration with multi-actors, such as services users, multi-professionals, agencies and cross-sectoral. the proposed framework is based on the who’s (world health organisation) international classification of functioning, disability and health (icf) (n.d.) ref and the cga mentioned above and is outlined in figure 1. 142 preventing falls ﻿ the proposed cafaha groups the social assessment of older persons into the following categories: activity, capability, inclusion, attitude, mood, circumstances and family, while the health assessment focusses on such categories as: cerebration, memory, behaviour, stress, sleep, pain, nutrition, with specific assessments needed pending context and culture. the eip aha action group 2 falls prevention (eip on aha achievements: action group a2 – falls prevention, n.d.) proposed information and process model of lreadyliz conditions and functioning within active and healthy ageing requires an understanding of the who-where-what-why-how to work with context and culture. many different categories of professionals and students (who) are interacting, alongside the service user and informal carers, at variou– locations (where), that serve as older persons’ home as well as care settings/points-of-care. various forms of assessments (what) are required at points-of-service, sometimes specific assessments like those for fall and injury risk, sometimes more general quality of life-oriented assessments, sometimes specific assessments related to cognitive capacity. assessments are typically performed prior to decisions about care levels, which in turn is based on criteria, underlying circumstances, and motivations (why), and related objectives. once a need for care has been lreadyl, implementation of care is based on good practices, recommendations, and guidelines (how). who: older persons together and with professionals working with older persons in order for falls prevention education to be successful it is essential to include older persons together with their loved ones for example spouse, children, grandchildren, relatives and neighbours and friends who live nearby. in addition, it is important to educate the wider community of people that encounter older adults for example, during visits to the store, riding the bus or participating in an exercise group. figure 1. proposed common assessment framework for active and healthy ageing (cafaha) to foster innovation in lreadyliz health management 143 preventing falls ﻿ in all these situations, the older person works, meets, and talks with other people. from a fall prevention perspective, it is important that all people who work and meet older persons have some knowledge and skills to prevent falls. relatives and loved ones have a key role to play as caregivers when they support older persons’ independent living. it is important that these carers are included in any local and national education campaigns on fall prevention. from the traditional perspective, the stakeholders who work with older adults are typically healthcare professionals classified based on their education, specialty, and experience. there is no unique or allencompassing international classification of healthcare professionals. this explains, in part, why education programmes are not internationally lreadyl for all healthcare professionals. additionally, countries differ in the lreadyliz and structure of their health and social care systems. in health care sectors, workers are for example nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, medical doctors, and other health care professionals. their role is based on their education, professional competencies, and remit within each setting. another important professional group are physical activity and exercise instructors who deliver group-based exercise classes in the community based settings. in the wider context the “who” question is important. it is not such the social and health care professionals but also all people in society. in the basic planning of the entire society, the design of infrastructure and services should consider services that are suitable for everyone, including older persons. for example, architects whose plan living environments and the buildings so that they are accessible, and they support participation. an accessible environment also provides a safe environment for movement and prevents falls. at the same time, it enables and even empowers the older person to live an active life. in summary, many professional from different field need some education to fall prevention. one important question is who can be educator and who can educate whom? where do we need to educate about falls prevention? educational information needs to be there where older persons live their active lives and where they used services. it is in different kind of places and contents in community, city, state and globally. figure 2. illustrates the different groups of people who need education in fall prevention based on where older persons live and use services. all older persons should be advised on falls prevention and given knowledge and information on how to prevent falls. for example, community-based care is provided in the community or in a person’s own home, hospital care in acute settings or care in supported longer stay settings. an accessible home environment is essential wherever a person lives to support active independent living without falls. 144 preventing falls ﻿ different prevention strategies are required depending upon an older person’s risk of falls. in all cases, older persons need to be informed about self-management strategies including on how they can prevent falls in their living environment. for example, by changing one’s own behaviour, changing the interior of the home, or increasing the accessibility of the home. in hospital acute care environment fall prevention is an important part of care and rehabilitation as the person is unwell and the environment is unfamiliar. in care homes, when older person is unable to live independently, falls prevention is similarly important to note. for example, older people with cognitive decline, stroke or frailty need a safe environment in which to live and move. what do we need to include? information, knowledge, and skills should be tailored to whom the education is being provided to and in what context. this means that the content and delivery should be lreadylized to meet the specific needs of the individual or group. in this section, the main categories of what should be included for older persons, health care professionals and students are listed. the following information based on the guidelines, recommendations, and good practices (panel on prevention of falls in older persons, american geriatrics society and british geriatrics society, 2011; pajala, 2012, the finnish association of physiotherapists, 2017; health quality & safety commission new zealand, 2020; montero-odasso et al., 2022; affinity, 2022). for older persons themselves the following information is important to include information on: figure 2. groups who need falls prevention education based on where older person live and use services 145 preventing falls ﻿ • physical activity programmes to maintain and improve balance, muscle strength and flexibility • instructions for physical activity that can provide optimum bone loading to lready bone health • safe living environment at home (inside and outside) • good nutrition, vitamin d • use of alcohol • preventing slips: footwear and anti-slip • safe pedestrian crossing in winter • mobility aids • hip protectors • security technology • self-assessment measures of performance such as fear of falls or fall risk assessment. health care professionals and health care students should know how to prevent, manage and rehabilitate following falls. in addition to this they should know. • up to date evidence-based practice to prevent falls • international and national guidelines and recommendations relate to falls prevention • international classification of functioning, disability and health (icf) and how to use that to describe the medical condition and functioning capacity of the older person • to understand and be able to perform a comprehensive geriatric assessment (cga) • typical acute and chronic diseases (icd-10), treatment, rehabilitation, and medication for these diseases • drug side effects • etiology of falls (intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors) • typical injury of older people and treatment and rehabilitation of these injuries • assessment tools to evaluate functional ability, all dimensions: ◦◦ physical ◦◦ psychological ◦◦ social ◦◦ cognitive ◦◦ activities of daily living ◦◦ fear of falling • how to motivate older people for example to maintain function and keep physically active • international classification of health interventions (ichi) to plan good and individualise intervention to prevent falls. why do we educate about fall prevention? why is education on fall prevention so important? this can be examined from two perspectives; these are individual and society perspectives. first, all individuals deserve to live in an environment that is safe and enables active living without the risk of fall. secondly, people have the right to receive help and services when they need them for health or some other reason. society must offer these services flexibly to everyone. 146 preventing falls ﻿ from the older person’s perspective, the main aim is to prevent falls and consequences of falls. for the older person this means: • quality of life • active life • healthy life • support possibilities to live at home environment • skills and knowledge to keep up his/her functional ability in all functional dimension, physical, social, cognitive, psychological and activities of daily living • willingness to accept guidance and counselling and use it to promote his/her own health and well-being • willingness to accept aids • home renovations and money pay at least your share of the cost • prevention from the human suffering that are consequences of falls • willingness to participate in a fall’s prevention interventions. from society perspective the main aim is support older person active and healthy life. for the society this means:expenses to produce primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention services • savings when falls do not occur, and people do not need services • requires knowledge and skills of fall prevention • positive attitude • know-how to produce and offer falls prevention interventions • understanding of ageing. these aspects are related to policies and strategies adopted in regions and countries and are often connected with political ingrediencies. how do we educate to prevent falls? how we implement fall prevention educations? around the world in different institutions have their own methods and protocols to do fpe. often the same pedagogical methods and good practices work with health care professionals and students. in this section we describe few examples how to teach fall prevention to the health care students and professionals and older persons. in higher education institutions, among health and social care student’s education have used different kind of pedagogical solutions and methods to teach falls prevention (äijö, 2019a) and new ideas for the educational programmes have present (äijö et al., 2021a). education also varies from non-professional teaching to multi-professional teaching. savonia university applied sciences have developed falls prevention education and teaching. the figure 3. describing the integrative model of fpe. this model included in the continuum from theoretical studies to the clinical practice describing the teaching methods. this model has been studied during 2015-2018 in savonia uas and the results are describing more deeply below lready. 147 preventing falls ﻿ among health care students, theoretical knowledge forms the basic understanding in teaching and learning on falls prevention. at the beginning of the fpe, it is good to examine the students’ knowledge of fall prevention. for example, äijö et al. (2019b) study results showed that nursing students had lot of theoretical knowledge concerning fall risk factors and fall prevention at the beginning of the specific course related to gerontological nursing. the third study year students have had many other theoretical courses and clinical practices before that fpe, and they have learned to reflect their learning experiences. it is recommended to consider this competence when planning the content and methods of the fpe for the students. for the health care professionals education workshops have significantly improved participants’ knowledge, confidence and behaviour regarding fall prevention exercise prescription (tiedemann et al., 2021). in addition, an interactive education workshop on how to use a new evidence-based hospital falls screening tool to help decrees the falls risk, supports the use of evidence-based services and implementation of clinical guidelines (shaw, kiegaldie & morris, 2021a). among health care professionals a high-quality education programmes grounded in a rigorous quality framework improved participants’ knowledge regarding evidence-based falls prevention and use of evidence-based rationales for behaviour change promotes effective learning (shaw, kiegaldie, jones, & morris, 2021b). interprofessional learning it is evident that falls are complex, and a multidisciplinary approach is required to successfully prevent and manage falls holistically. hence, when educating students undertaking a professional qualification in allied health, nursing and medicine, interprofessional learning and case-based approaches can be used to facilitate collaborative learning leading to improved interdisciplinary communication, teamwork and patient care (o’leary et al., 2020). figure 3. integrative model of fpe in savonia university of applied sciences (äijö 2019a) 148 preventing falls ﻿ interprofessional education (ipe) can occur in a variety of settings for example in a classroom at university, simulated environment, or while on practice placement in the clinical setting (o’leary et al., 2020). interprofessional teaching integrates teaching methods, teaching contents and students from two or more disciplines together. in nursing education, it has been found that learning-oriented and participatory pedagogy, which integrates different teaching methods, increased students’ accountability for their own learning and created optimum conditions for lifelong learning (reyes et al., 2018). by using varied teaching methods, it is also possible to strengthen and deepen students’ learning of theoretical knowledge in a certain teaching content, for example in the prevention of falls. an interprofessional educational model by brown et al. (2018) included five teaching steps: 1. online didactic content delivery, 2. poster-based skills practice, 3 interprofessional team simulation, 4. patient assessment and 5. expert team feedback. the steps included both uniprofessional and interprofessional teaching and learning. the learning experience based on the interprofessional education model by brown et al. (2018) lead to a positive outcome among students from different health and social care fields in geriatric falls assessment and prevention. it also resulted in an increase in positive attitude regarding interprofessional team-based care and satisfaction with learning. a variety of pedagogical concepts and learning methods can be used to teach and learn about falls and falls prevention including case-based learning, simulation based training or patient scenarios in practice. indeed, research has identified that case-based approaches can be a more effective teaching method to improve student’s ability to problem solve compared to traditional methods of teaching and learning (bi et al., 2019). simulated learning environments and skills labs are thought to promote students integrative learning as they engage in experiences that merge theoretical knowledge, practical skills and interdisciplinary team working. simulation based training can range from using trained actors with scripted clinical scenarios to represent a standardised patient to realistic life-sized computerised manikins (acosta et al., 2022). recently, acosta et al. (2022) found that simulation-based training for fall prevention was both valuable and well received by most frontline nursing home staff. similarly, silén-lipponen et al. (2019) showed that a full-scale fall prevention simulation scenario helped nursing students apply theoretical knowledge about fall prevention in authentic simulations. in addition, they found that students learned to analyse the client’s physical capacity, provide advice, respect the client’s autonomy and evaluate the client’s mental capacity. simulation was also shown to help students extend their knowledge-based competence and develop their professional identity formation (feldman et al., 2022; torkshavand, khatiban & soltanian, 2020). in addition, simulation appeared to be equally as good when compared to written falls prevention education among older adults at hospital environment. (dewalt et al., 2023). practice placement are important learning environments for students. for example, turjamaa et al. (2020) study showed that nursing students experiences of falls and fall prevention were based on their experiences when working in that setting. fall prevention during home visits included fall prevention in authentic client situations, confidential relationships with older clients, and evidence-based knowledge. students were educated on fall prevention, however, the evaluation of nutrition and adverse drug effects seemed to be ignored. in addition, they felt that there was a lack of comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the meaning of psychological factors, such as fear of falling. thus, it is imperative that education programmes are holistic and include information and strategies to target all aspects. practice placement or clinical hours typically account for a significant proportion of a students’ professional qualification programme. interprofessional practice placements (ipp), which are endorsed by the world health organization (2010), are a key component of ipe. interprofessional practice placements 149 preventing falls ﻿ are when students from two or more professions work together at a practice placement site to provide patient care. ipp can provide an authentic opportunity for students to work together and translate their knowledge and skills from the classroom environment to practice settings (o’leary et al., 2020). fall prevention ipe activities can be used to inform older adults, students, and healthcare professionals about falls prevention and management following a fall. research identified that an ipe activity using the centers for disease control and prevention (stopping elderly accidents, deaths & injuries (steadi) initiative was an effective framework and resource for fall prevention ipe activities (taylor et al., 2019). in comparison, research identified that a 1-hour education session was insufficient to empower qualified health care professionals (hcps) implement the safe recovery programme. hence, in order for ipe to be successful and meet the needs of participants the authors recommend that education providers engage with participants in advance to identify training needs and provide sufficient opportunities for feedback and discussion during the application phase with patients (shaw et al., 2023). meaningful education should be offered to all older persons. for example, the irish affinity (2019) project delivered a symposium which included members of age friendly ireland and older people’s councils who co-designed and delivered an interactive workshop on independent living and community supports. this workshop included such topics as: wellbeing wednesdays, falls and injury prevention practices, and establishing interagency otago strength and balance exercise programmes. the workshop slides and other materials from this event are available in website of affinity (2019). the workshop testifies to the importance of ensuring that older persons and their careers are enabled to co-create and prioritise what matters to them in ageing well. falls prevention education should be recommended for older adults during and after hospitalizsation included in intensive face-to-face patient education with multimedia materials (lee, pritchard, mcdermott & haines 2014). in addition, good results were achieved when residents’ brochures included clear information on avoiding external risks as well as coping strategies after a fall event have been used with residents and family members (schoberer, eglseer, halfens, & lohrmann, 2018). possible barriers for example time constraints, limited interprofessional collaboration, and a lack of staff input into do fall prevention work should be solved so that health care professionals can play a key role in delivering evidence-based falls prevention education in hospitals (heng et al. 2022a; heng et al., 2022b). conclusion this chapter summarised the need of fpe. a lot of evidence exists to support the content and delivery of fpe programmes. still more work is needed to actualise these programmes at all levels and in all situations where we work with older persons. professionals’ key role is to use and share evidence-based knowledge about falls and falls prevention with older persons and use appropriate fpe methods. this means taking an evidence-based approach by incorporating the best available evidence with practice expertise, values and perspectives of older adults and context. professionals need education so that they can educate older people. but this is not enough. in the bigger picture, we should develop society and healthcare system that is age-friendly, and where changes due to ageing are taken into account. in this way, the structures and services would support older adults participating in society holistically: physically, psychologically, and socially. this development includes a fall prevention perspective. through this, we can develop society, services, and education to successful prevent falls in older persons. 150 preventing falls ﻿ references .acosta, d.j., rinfret, a., plant, j. & hsu, a.t.

nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease ﻿ introduction the increase in average life expectancy is reflected in the increase in the elderly population worldwide. therefore, it is necessary to adopt new strategies to enhance the autonomy, confidence, and mobility of these people, allowing, simultaneously, to extend the time they can live under the most favorable conditions. chronic diseases are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in europe, accounting for more than 2/3 of all deaths and 75% of healthcare costs (gemmill, 2019). this aspect, accompanied by technological medical advances, translates into a constant update of therapeutic strategies. however, the success of these strategies depends on the empowerment of the elderly to adhere to the therapeutic regimen, minimizing complications of diseases and, therefore, in quality of life (lópez-romero et al, 2016; lefler et al., 2018; avazeh et al., 2019). one of the main issues in improving the quality of life of the elderly is maintaining their autonomy in physical and cognitive activities. the concept of “self-care” was introduced by orem (2001), referring to the learned behaviors that people demonstrate to maintain or improve their life, health, well-being, prevention, and treatment. due to the chronic nature of the disease, adherence to the therapeutic regimen promotes self-care and changes in lifestyle that translate into increased well-being, prevention of exacerbation of signs and symptoms, and reduction in the number of hospitalizations and treatment costs (chew et al, 2021). non-adherence to the therapeutic regimen is a common problem among elderly people with chronic diseases. many studies have been developed, but this situation continues to constitute a health problem that is difficult to resolve because the causes of non-adherence among the elderly are multiple and complex (who, 2003). consequently, health professionals, particularly nurses, must combine educational and behavioral strategies that promote this compliance, considering the client’s age and the stage of the disease. adherence to the therapeutic regimen is defined by who (2003, p. 18) as: ‘the extent to which a person’s behavior – taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes – corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider’. this concept does not intend to reflect a judgment, a failure of the client, or the prescribed treatment, but states a fact so that it can be prevented (haynes et al. 2008). given the above, it was decided to elaborate a scoping review, guided by the methodology proposed by the joanna briggs institute (jbi) (peters et al., 2020), to systematically explore and map the evidence available in the literature on the intervention of the nurse in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly person with a chronic disease. such data are relevant since they can support the analysis, reflection, and investigation of the nurse’s role in this context. more specifically, this review aims to answer the question: what are the nursing interventions that facilitate therapeutic adherence in elderly people with chronic illnesses? systematic review method according to the recommendations of the joanna briggs institute (jbi) for conducting a scoping review (peters et al., 2020), the pcc strategy (participants, concept, and context) was used with the following inclusion criteria: 159 nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease ﻿ inclusion criteria search strategy the research strategy included studies written in english, french, spanish, and portuguese, published in the last 10 years, more specifically between september 2012 and september 2022. data were collected using the cinahl plus with full-text databases and medline with full text, from the ebscohost platform. initially, an initial search was carried out in the databases included to analyze and group the words contained in the text of the titles and abstracts most used in the articles. in a second moment, a search was carried out in these same databases using the identified keywords and indexing terms. subsequently, the bibliographic references of the articles and studies identified were analyzed to search and include additional studies. the search results were exported to the mendeley® reference management software and duplicate articles were removed. then, a critical and reflective reading of the titles and abstracts of the researched articles was carried out to evaluate their relevance to the review. a careful analysis of the articles that meet the inclusion criteria, through full reading, was performed to extract the evidence related to the contributions of nursing interventions on the health of the elderly. to organize the analysis, phrases, and words that corresponded to elements of interest related to models of professional nursing practice were identified and transcribed. the data extraction includes a logical and descriptive summary of the results that must be in line with the objectives and questions of the scoping review (peters et al., 2020). to systematize the information in the articles, the extracted data were descriptively compiled by two independent reviewers, using an instrument previously prepared by the authors. at all stages, the analysis of the full text of the articles was performed by two reviewers independently, to verify the satisfaction of the defined inclusion criteria. in cases where discrepancies were found, a third reviewer was consulted for a final decision. table 1. inclusion criteria participants concept context studies that include people over 65 years of age studies that

the form of graphs, figures, and/or tables (peters et al., 2020). in the research, 281 articles were identified, of which 14 were excluded because they were duplicates. of the 267 remaining articles, 227 were excluded after analyzing the title and abstract. subsequently, of the remaining 40 articles, 29 were excluded after reading the full text for not meeting the inclusion criteria. conclusively, 11 studies that present nursing interventions that facilitate the management of the therapeutic regimen of a person with a chronic disease were included in the review (figure 1). figure 1. prisma

(2020) education based on multimedia clips by peers was effective in increasing the mean scores of self-care adherence, and quality of life among elderly people with coronary artery disease. considering the low cost, high effectiveness, and decrease in the nurses’ workload, this method is recommended to be used alongside other methods to educate elderly individuals suffering from coronary artery disease. henriques, costa & cabrita (2012) four categories emerged on strategies used for medication management by elderly people living at home: living with drugs, taking medication, belief about drugs and relationship with health professionals. participants refer that the information transmitted by nurses during a nursing consultation is very important in managing the medication regimen. pereira, teixeira, lopes & sousa (2020) telemonitoring technologies enable autonomous monitoring and timely feedback to caregivers and healthcare professionals. smartbeat is an e-health system composed of a mobile application for smartphones that allows autonomous monitoring and the provision of timely feedback to caregivers and health professionals. this system was tested, in a pilot phase, with a user adherence of 97% for three months. verwey et al. (2015) a self-management support program was implemented, including a monitoring-andfeedback tool. this tool was developed to encourage physical activity, providing feedback to clients and nurses. its use was combined with the behaviour change counselling protocol. clients who used the monitoring-and-feedback tool in conjunction with physical activity advice from nurses showed better results in terms of improving physical activity than clients who only received advice on physical activity. hu et al.

(2020) revealed that the use of multimedia-based peer education leads to a significant increase in mean scores of self-care, therapeutic adherence, and quality of life study nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease and results heiney et al. (2020) the healthy heart application is part of an intervention aimed at self-monitoring of symptoms, health literacy and confidence (self-efficacy) of clients with heart failure. in this application, customers receive messages daily to remind them of the need for daily monitoring of body weight, and educational and motivational messages. in addition to these messages, customers receive personalized feedback and make a daily record in the application. results show clinically relevant changes in self-care maintenance, management, and confidence. to et al. (2019) a program based on information-motivation-behavioural skills improves inhalation adherence, inhalation techniques, and quality of life in obstructive pulmonary disease patients. the first session was face-to-face, individual, and lasted one hour. in this session, based on the contents addressed, the nurse prepared a report, gathered patient information, and identified problems, provided information, counselling, enhanced correct inhalation techniques and related behaviours and established an action plan. the second and fourth session took place in the second and fourth week and it lasted 30 minutes via telephone, with the objective to evaluate, identify problem and counselling. swavely et al. (2014) the low health literacy and culturally sensitive diabetes education program included individualized and group sessions with 13 hours of education over 12 weeks. this program was destined patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. the teach-back method, map visuals, conversation questions, discussion cards, group interaction, and facilitation were used to empower clients to manage the therapeutic regimen and take responsibility for their own selfcare. at the end of the program, patients had significant improvements in their knowledge about diabetes, self-efficacy and in three domains of self-care including diet, foot care and exercise. murdoch (2019) the use of a prescription pyramid helped the nurse in health education in patients with chronic oedema, specifically in the prescription of compression to manage chronic oedema. this prescribing pyramid must consecutively consider the following principles: reflection, record keeping, review, negotiating a contract, choosing a product, choosing a strategy, and taking the patient into account. including the patient in the decision-making process favours agreement and helps to reduce unnecessary prescriptions and avoid non-adherence to the therapeutic regimen. valsaraj et al. (2021) the cognitive behaviour therapy on patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis is more effective than non-directive counselling for improving therapeutic adherence. this intervention aims to analyse and replace negative thoughts with stimuli that promote emotional regulation and positive behavioural changes. there was a statistically significant improvement in the experimental group compared to the control group, particularly regarding to interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin, dialysis adherence, fluid adherence, diet and drug adherence in the patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis. table 2. continued 164 nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease ﻿ among elderly people with coronary artery disease compared to the control group. clients received three 20-minute educational videos about coronary artery disease that were shared by a peer who had been on treatment for at least six months and who had been previously trained by a nurse. these videos addressed the therapeutic regimen and information on how to perform activities of daily living. regarding medication management, a study carried out by henriques, costa, and cabrita (2012) in portugal, identified that the strategies used for medication management by elderly people living at home include four categories: live with drugs, take medication, beliefs about drugs, and relationship with health professionals. the study participants mentioned that the therapeutic relationship established with health professionals is a fundamental aspect of medication adherence, namely the information transmitted by the nurse during the consultation. the use of telemedicine and telemonitoring technologies is also advantageous in the management of the elderly person’s therapeutic regimen. mobile health apps allow clients and nurses quick and easy access to health information in real-time, which can help in making health decisions and, inherently, improve patient outcomes. recent studies show that the use of these apps can contribute to a reduction in mortality and hospitalizations and increase adherence to therapy. among the benefits associated with this strategy, the fact that the elderly do not need to leave the comfort of their home to interact with the nurses is identified, since it is possible to give and receive daily feedback through these new applications, wearable technology, and healthcare platform. these systems are associated with an improvement in costs, autonomy, self-confidence, and customer mobility (pereira, teixeira, lopes, & sousa, 2020). the smart system for management of heart failure in older adults (smartbeat) is an e-health system, developed in portugal, which consists of an application for smartphones intended for patients with a diagnosis of heart failure. this application allows you to collect physiological information (weight, blood pressure, heart rate, medication intake, physical activity, spo2) from the client using a vital signs system. in addition to automatic responses, the nurse can interact with the client through the application. there was 97% user adherence to the platform for 3 months, including people with low technology literacy (pereira, teixeira, lopes, & sousa, 2020). also in the united states of america, an application was developed - healthy heart - which was built interactively, based on a literature review, and information from clients with heart failure and health professionals, including nurses. the application aims to promote self-monitoring of symptoms, health literacy, and confidence (self-efficacy). three messages were sent daily to customers through the application, particularly a reminder to carry out daily monitoring of body weight, an educational and motivational message. in addition to these messages, customers receive personalized feedback and make daily records in the application. after the intervention, there was an improvement in self-perception of health: at the beginning of the study, 42% of the participants reported that their health was poor or fair, a value that decreased to 18% at the end of the study. as for physically unhealthy days, there was a reduction in the mean value from 4 days to 2.54 days. after the intervention, there was also a reduction from 2.58 to 1.73 in the number of days participants reported experiencing limitations in daily activities due to poor physical or mental health. the participants presented clinically relevant results, specifically concerning heart failure self-care maintenance, management, and confidence. they also showed low rates of hospital readmissions and emergency room visits (heiney et al., 2020). another study, carried out in the netherlands, used a self-management support program to improve the adherence of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus to physical exercise. group 1 was submitted to the use of a tool embedded in the counseling protocol called the self-management support program and group 2 was submitted only to the self-management support 165 nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease ﻿ program. clients who used the monitoring-and-feedback tool were 14% more satisfied with the advice provided by nurses than the group that did not use this tool, considering that using the tool was fun; it led to greater awareness and more discipline. regarding the self-perception of improvement in physical activity, 75% of the clients who used the mobile device considered that their levels of physical activity had improved compared to 46% of the clients in group 2. the nurses themselves considered that the intervention using the tool was more effective since monitoring encourages people to be more physically active and guides the advice given by the nurse to each client (verwey et al., 2015). health education carried out by nurses, based on the knowledge, belief, and practice model influences the self-management ability, satisfaction, and compliance of elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. a study carried out in china revealed that the compliance rate of the study group was 26% higher than that of the control group. the control group received routine nursing consultation and the patients in the study group received nurse-led health education based on knowledge, belief, and practice model. there were statistically significant improvements in the study group compared to the control group. the symptoms management, daily life management, emotion management, information management, and management efficiency were higher in the study group than in the control group. equally the outcomes of physiological, psychological, and social function and health self-perception decreased in the study group than in the control group (hu et al., 2022). a study carried out in india (valsaraj et al., 2021) aimed to evaluate the effect of cognitive behavior therapy on patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. a structured individual therapy of cognitive, behavioral, and didactic techniques with 10 weekly sessions was given to the experimental group. in these sessions, the nurse tried to analyze and replace negative thoughts to achieve emotional regulation and positive behavioral changes. subsequently, there was a significant improvement in interdialytic weight gain, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, dialysis adherence, fluid adherence, diet adherence, and drug adherence. the improvement in these outcomes was maintained for three to six months after the intervention. so, there was a significant impact of the use of cognitive behavior therapy by nurses on compliance with recommended diet, fluids, drugs, and dialysis (valsaraj et al., 2021). nurses need to understand the disease and perception of treatment from the patient’s perspective and thus address their individual concerns. a study carried out in hong kong (to et al., 2019) identified that clients with obstructive pulmonary disease identified that the main barriers to adherence to the therapeutic regimen and optimization of inhalation techniques were time constraints, and insufficient knowledge and skills. in this sense, they sought to develop a program based on information-motivation-behavioral skills to improve inhalation adherence. the intervention included a first face-to-face session to assess the client’s knowledge of the disease and therapeutic regimen, attitudes towards adherence, and inhalation techniques. based on the assessment results, the educational content was adapted to meet the individual needs of each client and answer their questions. in this session, proper breathing and inhalation techniques were reinforced; and the demonstration and skills training were carried out. in this session, the nurse defined the self-directed goals and the corresponding action plan with the clients. in the second and fourth weeks of the program, a telephone follow-up was carried out. in these teleconsultations, the nurse assessed respiratory symptoms and difficulties related to medication adherence; analyzed with the client the level of achievement of the objectives, eventual barriers to the achievement of previously defined goals, and, in a partnership approach, outlined continuity strategies to be adopted. the nurse also used positive reinforcement to improve patients’ self-efficacy in positive behavioral changes. this program had a positive effect on inhalation adherence, optimization of inhalation techniques, and quality of life in obstructive pulmonary disease patients (to et al., 2019). 166 nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease ﻿ telenursing is a strategy that does not require many technological resources, it can improve adherence to the therapeutic regimen in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. a study carried out in iran (shahsavari et al., 2020) involving 60 illiterate patients with type 2 diabetes, showed that face-to-face group health education sessions, accompanied by telephone nursing consultations, are effective in the continuity of care and health improvement. all subjects completed the group self-management training for diabetes in three days. subsequently, telephone follow-ups were carried out for 3 months in the intervention group, with each teleconsultation taking an average of 20 minutes. in this study group, their adherence to the treatment plan (including exercise, diet, and medication) was evaluated twice a week in the first and second months, and once a week in the third month. the contents addressed in the nursing teleconsultation included the assessment of adherence to the therapeutic plan and the proposal of solutions to facilitate compliance. the control group received routine care from the diabetes outpatient clinic. there was a statistically significant decrease in body mass index (decreased to 0.93 kg/m2 after the study) and glycosylated hemoglobin (decreased to 1.40%) in the intervention group compared to the control group (shahsavari et al., 2020). the use of map visuals, conversation questions, discussion cards, group interaction, and facilitation also promotes the empowerment of patients to manage the therapeutic regimen and to take responsibility for their self-care. these strategies, together with the use of the teach-back method, were integrated into a diabetes education program designed to be culturally sensitive and meet the needs of individuals with low health literacy. this program comprised 13 hours of health education over 12 weeks. at first, aspects related to the human body and adequate functions were addressed, and then the aspects associated with the management of the therapeutic regimen in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus were discussed. the teach-back method aimed to promote the memorization and reaffirmation of the contents learned by the patients, to guarantee that they assimilated and understood the information. aspects related to self-efficacy, the belief in their ability to complete tasks, manage situations, and reach goals, were also highlighted to encourage the client’s involvement in the management of the therapeutic regimen. at the end of the program, patients had significant improvements in diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, and in three domains of self-care including diet, foot care, and exercise (swavely et al., 2014). in the management of disease and therapeutic regimen, patient-related factors are critical, particularly patient compliance with therapies. in this sense, the nurse needs to negotiate the therapeutic regimen with the patient, considering their knowledge and health beliefs. a case study, which took place in the united kingdom, revealed that a prescription pyramid is a facilitator of effective nursing prescription. this tool must consider, consecutively, from bottom to top, seven principles: reflection, record keeping, reviewing, negotiating a contract, choosing a product, choosing a strategy, and considering the patient. all these principles guide the aspects to be systematically worked with the client during the nursing consultation, before prescribing, canceling the prescription, or even not prescribing an intervention. a subsidized approach in this process facilitates an accurate differential diagnosis, the identification of strategies to be adopted, and the client’s inclusion in the care plan. in this case study, this patient-centered approach included a global assessment from the beginning, allowing to identify the etiology of the symptoms presented, to analyze in detail the reason for the failure of previous strategies for managing the therapeutic regimen in a situation of chronic edema of the lower limbs and to guarantee a prescription with positive and satisfactory outcomes, namely in the management of the therapeutic regimen (murdoch, 2019). 167 nursing intervention in the therapeutic adherence of the elderly with chronic disease ﻿ conclusion the objective of this scoping review was to explore and map the available scientific evidence on nursing interventions that facilitate therapeutic adherence in elderly people with chronic illness. the limitation of this review is the exclusion of articles in other languages than portuguese, spanish, english, or french. extensive research in other databases could be important in identifying relevant results. eleven studies from europe, asia, and north america were identified in this review. nursing interventions that improve therapeutic adherence can occur in person, through scheduled and unscheduled consultations, or digitally, using videos, remote monitoring software, teleconsultations (video or call), or text messages (sms) that integrate reminders, additional information, and questions/ answers. measures that enhance therapeutic adherence include continuous monitoring and surveillance, the elaboration of a personalized and gradual therapeutic plan; skills training based on a model of information, motivation, and behavior; the explanation of the value and therapeutic intent of the care plan; cognitive behavioral therapy; the use of schemes that elucidate the objectives and period; and the continuous validation of the patient education through the teach-back method. evidence shows that the development and implementation of educational and behavioral interventions promote self-care and adherence translated into health gains. the need and relevance of nursing consultations (face-to-face or remotely) in the process of health education to the elderly person are also evidenced. references avazeh, m., babaei, n., farhoudi, s., kalteh, e. a., & gholizadeh, b.

auning et al., 2011). however, dementia patients suffer from more complex cognitive deficits due to the disease’s gradual neurodegenerative nature, including severe memory loss, thinking difficulties, and problems sustaining conversations. the most common dementia subtypes are: alzheimer’s disease (ad) which shows amyloid plaques and tau tangles in brain scans (50–75%); vascular dementia (vd), which shows damaged blood cells in brain images (20%); dementia with lewy bodies (lbd) (10–15%) which shows protein formation in the brain; and frontotemporal dementia (ftd) which shows abnormal tau proteins and tdp-43 formation (2%) in brain scans (national institute for health and care excellence, 2018, 2021). cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare: a cognitive ability testing guide aikaterini christogianni loughborough university, uk 171 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ older adults often show signs of cognitive impairment that may or may not develop into dementia. when their families notice signs of cognitive decline, they refer them to a family medical doctor for an evaluation. the medical doctor then arranges cognitive assessments to examine whether the patient has cognitive decline because of ageing, early signs of dementia, dementia, or a healthy brain. neurologists and clinicians assess dementia using brain scans such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography; blood tests to measure beta-amyloid concentration; cognitive tests that assess memory, problem-solving, language difficulties, calculation functions, body balance, sensory and reflex responses (jacova et al., 2007). the chapter addresses the most common neuropsychological assessments used during screening procedures for cognitive decline (jacova et al., 2007; jorm, 1996). they are reliable and valid methods for determining whether a patient has cognitive impairment, producing results ranging from mild to severe impairment. the chapter also discusses the benefits of timely diagnosis and health economics. background mild cognitive impairment (mci) or mild neurocognitive disorder, according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) (american psychiatric association, 2022), refers to cognitive deterioration that does not affect daily activities and independent living (petersen, 2016). mci has 12% to 18% prevalence rates worldwide in people 60 years and older (petersen, 2016). when a family member or an individual notices symptoms of cognitive decline, such as problems with memory, reasoning, task completion, and information processing (alzheimer’s association, 2022; auning et al., 2011), the first step is to visit a general practitioner (gp) in primary care (alzheimer’s society, 2016; national collaborating centre for mental health, 2018; petersen, 2016). the individual is then evaluated for cognitive impairment using neuropsychological testing procedures. although cognitive decline is a normal part of ageing, it may or may not be mci. as a result, thorough testing by experienced neuropsychologists and doctors may reveal evidence in each case. mci is classified into two types: amnestic (multiple-domain cognitive decline, especially memory deterioration) and nonamnestic (cognitive deterioration in cognitive skills other than memory) (alexopoulos et al., 2006; petersen, 2016; yaffe et al., 2006). however, the amnestic mci is more likely to progress into dementia of the two categories (alexopoulos et al., 2006; petersen, 2016; yaffe et al., 2006). in particular, mci patients with lesions in the posterior cingulate, anterior cingulate, hippocampus and inferior parietal cortex might be diagnosed with dementia within a few years (alexopoulos et al., 2006; evans et al., 2018; iizuka et al., 2017; jacobs et al., 2012). cognitive test batteries for the mci diagnosis focus on assessing specific cognitive domains to suit the patients’ needs and determine the level of cognitive decline (monastero et al., 2009). examples of such assessments are intelligence measurements, attention, memory, language, spatial skills and many more (monastero et al., 2009). dementia remains among the most common diseases diagnosed in old individuals (world health organization, 2021). it is a syndrome characterised by chronic, progressive, irreversible brain neurodegeneration caused by chemical and structural changes and results in neuronal loss and shrinkage of brain volume (dening & sandilyan, 2015). aside from memory loss, early signs of cognitive deterioration include difficulty telling time, maintaining a conversation, navigating outdoors, and confusion during information processing and decision-making (alzheimer’s association, 2022; auning et al., 2011; hettinga et al., 2009). 172 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ although individuals may exhibit any of the listed symptomatology, determining whether they are specific dementia signs or cognitive impairment due to mci or normal ageing can sometimes be challenging in healthcare settings. one way to tackle this issue is to visit a gp in time. patients with cognitive deficits must receive their diagnosis early before progressing to the moderate stages of their disease. once symptoms worsen to moderate cognitive decline, patients begin to experience serious difficulties with recognising people and places, recalling names, understanding right and left orientation, telling the time, counting, drawing and having conversations (choe et al., 2008). patients’ autobiographical memory is intact, along with object naming (choe et al., 2008). however, in severe stages, the cognitive deterioration is so serious that patients cannot communicate their needs, make decisions about their daily life, or live independently; thus, hospitalisations might be necessary (epstein-lubow & fulton, 2012; ning et al., 2020). despite the fact that there are medical treatments for dementia, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, they only temporarily relieve symptoms but cannot cure them (national health service, 2020b). since more people grow into old age, the number of dementia cases grows worldwide, and so do the health and socioeconomic care costs for dementia patients (han et al., 2021). as a result, healthcare has given the highest consideration to suggesting early clinical testing and has created dementia information policies that will be helpful in decision-making and quality of life after the diagnosis (winblad et al., 2016). the clinical cognitive assessments are conducted using neuropsychological tests that have demonstrated good validity and reliability in distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with cognitive impairment (mitrushina et al., 2005; o’connor, 1990). the clinical brain-behaviour assessments that assist in diagnosing mci and dementia are neuropsychological tests (howieson, 2019). their focus and importance are constantly evolving and changing to cover the patient and healthcare needs. these assessments can be employed to determine the basic cognitive functions in an individual, contribute to the diagnosis, estimate the prognosis of cognitive impairment, and determine whether there are any mental health issues (howieson, 2019). neuropsychological tests have been developed to measure specific cognitive skills, psychological and behavioural symptoms in dementia. however, the assessments which have been tested for reliability, sensitivity, specificity, construct and convergence validity are advantageous in screening and diagnosing neurological diseases such as ad (howieson, 2019). it is important to note that many neuropsychological tests have normative data and include scores for each group of people based on demographic categories, such as gender, age and education (campbell, 2013; o’connor, 1990). notably, each neuropsychological test has a set of cut-off scores that represent the performance of a specific group of individuals (o’connor, 1990). as a result, the normative data are representative sample measurements or scores from the general population, and they use baseline distribution measurements to compare individuals and groups with each other (campbell, 2013; o’connor, 1990). these data types are essential in clinical practice because they assist in strengthening and establishing correct diagnoses (dodds et al., 2014; mitrushina et al., 2005). clinical normative data is especially beneficial when evaluating the severity of cognitive deficits because it enables healthcare professionals to characterise the patients’ cognitive skills based on how they function compared to others with mci and dementia. 173 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ cognitive impairment assessment tools the most commonly used cognitive assessments for mci and dementia in healthcare and academia worldwide are the following: the mini-mental state examination (mmse) measures recall, attention, language, calculation, the ability to follow simple commands, orientation, and the ability to repeat words. the test is a 30-item questionnaire that takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete (perneczky et al., 2006). in clinical settings, it has been used to detect signs of cognitive deficits and dementia. the time orientation is tested by asking questions about the time and date. the place orientation is tested by asking questions about the patient’s current location. the repetition is tested by repeating the names of objects. the calculation and attention are tested by backwards counting and backwards spelling. the recall is tested by recalling words. language ability is tested by repetition and writing sentences. understanding complex instructions are tested by copying a picture and following instructions (pangman et al., 2000). scores greater than 26 are considered normal, scores between 25 and 21 indicate mild impairment, scores between 20 and 11 indicate moderate impairment, and scores between 10 and 0 indicate severe dementia (perneczky et al., 2006). mmse has good predictive validity and reliability in people with dementia, and it has been translated into many languages (baek et al., 2016; davey & jamieson, 2004; güngen et al., 2002). some of the benefits of the mmse are that it is useful and reliable in clinical practice, and it can distinguish between individuals with cognitive impairment and without by being sensitive to age and education demographic characteristics (arevalo‐rodriguez et al., 2015; kurlowicz & wallace, 1999; simard, 1998). however, because it primarily relies on verbal response, reading, and writing, the mmse cannot differentiate between dementia types, may not detect early dementia, and cannot provide information about judgement and social reasoning mental processes (arevalo‐rodriguez et al., 2015; kurlowicz & wallace, 1999; simard, 1998). the trail making test (tmt) is one of the most common cognitive tests in healthcare, and it assesses visual search speed, visual scanning, psychomotor and processing speed, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning (ashendorf et al., 2008). there are two versions: the tmt a, which has 25 circles with numbers ranging from 1 to 25, and the tmt b, which has 25 circles with numbers ranging from 1 to 13 and letters ranging from a to l (rasmusson et al., 1998; zalonis et al., 2008). the patient is required to connect the numbers in order in tmt a, and connect the letters and and numbers by alternating between them in tmt b (rasmusson et al., 1998; zalonis et al., 2008). when patients take more than 80 seconds to complete tmt a, and 275 seconds to complete tmt b, it indicates that there are signs of brain impairment (rasmusson et al., 1998; zalonis et al., 2008). the test has shown predictive validity in distinguishing cognitive deficits between ageing groups and ad based on error analyses, and it has been used in many countries and languages (amieva et al., 1998; cangöz et al., 2013; wei et al., 2018). the tmt has the advantages of detecting executive dysfunction, being a reliable and robust measure of cognitive processing, and indicating moderate to severe impairment (bowie & harvey, 2006; linari et al., 2022). nonetheless, the evaluation of executive functions is not discriminated, and as a result, tmt has low specificity (bowie & harvey, 2006; linari et al., 2022). the mini-addenbrooke’s cognitive examination (mini-ace) is a 10-minute assessment tool for dementia and evaluates memory, orientation, visuospatial function, and language (charernboon, 2019; hsieh et al., 2015; larner, 2020). the orientation is tested with questions about date and time, memory is tested with learning and recall of words such as names and addresses, language is tested with the fluency of animal names and visuospatial function with clock drawing (charernboon, 2019; hsieh et al., 174 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ 2015; larner, 2020). its maximum score is 30, with 25 to 30 showing evidence that an individual has signs of moderate to severe dementia and scores 21 to 24 showing that the individual has mild dementia (hsieh et al., 2015; larner, 2020). the test comes from the addenbrooke’s cognitive examination-iii (ace-iii) and its predecessor, the addenbrooke’s cognitive examination-revised (ace-r) (hsieh et al., 2015). despite the fact that the ace iii is widely used in memory clinics around the world, it is a lengthy test that takes ~30 minutes to administer and includes tasks to assess memory, attention, language, and visuospatial abilities; it is not recommended for testing in busy hospitals or memory clinics (charernboon, 2019; larner, 2020). therefore, its shorter version, mini-ace, is preferred. the mini-ace has predicted validity, specificity and sensitivity in screening for dementia, and it has been translated into many languages (charernboon, 2019; hsieh et al., 2015; kourtesis et al., 2020; qassem et al., 2020, 2021). the test is useful in examining and monitoring patients with milder cognitive impairments in clinical settings, and it can produce some level of distinction between cognitive profiles (beishon et al., 2019; hsieh et al., 2015). however, research has revealed answer variability, such as false positives, among mci and dementia patients, which may affect interpretation (beishon et al., 2019; hsieh et al., 2015). the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) is a 10-minute test that assesses short-term and working memory, visuospatial abilities, attention, executive functions, language, and orientation (dautzenberg et al., 2020; poptsi et al., 2019). the visuospatial and executive functions are tested with numbers and letters to be connected in order, and with clock drawing. object naming is tested through animal drawing. memory is tested with learning and recall of a list of words. attention is tested through forward, and backwards recall of numbers, recognition of letters and calculations. language is tested with sentence repetition and word naming. abstract thinking is tested by understanding the similarities between words. delayed recall is tested with the recall of words. orientation is tested with the current date and place (dautzenberg et al., 2020; nasreddine et al., 2005). this assessment has shown evidence of distinguishing between mci and early ad (dautzenberg et al., 2020; nasreddine et al., 2005). the scores range from 0 to 30. ad has been identified with scores ~16, mci in scores ~22, with scores above 26 to be considered normal (dautzenberg et al., 2020). the test has demonstrated diagnostic utility in differentiating between patients with mci, dementia and patients’ normal cognitive processes, and thus, it is claimed that it can better detect patients in the early stages of cognitive impairment (fasnacht et al., 2022; ng et al., 2013). however, there are issues with using the same cut-off scores in some countries when, for example, culture is not taken into account in normative data scores (fasnacht et al., 2022; ng et al., 2013). the wisconsin card sorting test (wcst) is a digital test that evaluates abstract reasoning, strategic planning, concept formation, organised searching and identifies executive function deficits (kopp et al., 2021; nyhus & barceló, 2009; takeda et al., 2010). the patient is required to match cards to a set of reference cards based on shape, colour and number of stimuli presented in each card (kopp et al., 2021; nyhus & barceló, 2009; takeda et al., 2010). the geometric figures on the cards vary in number, shape, and colour (kopp et al., 2021; nyhus & barceló, 2009). the patients are required to use trial and error to determine the correct principle and take 20 to 30 minutes to administer (kopp et al., 2021; nyhus & barceló, 2009). the test results are digital psychometric scores that indicate whether a patient has acquired a brain injury and has a neurodegenerative disease based on normative data. wcst has shown evidence that it can differentiate between early dementia and severe dementia stages, considering the performance of healthy individuals on the test (bondi et al., 1993). the wcst is valid and reliable in diagnosing dementia and is used in many countries and languages (kopp et al., 2021; paolo et al., 1996). the test’s strengths include the ability to assess cognitive flexibility, abstraction, decision-making, reasoning, and information processing (kopp et al., 2021; miles et al., 2021). however, there are issues and 175 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ difficulties in testing, scoring, interpreting, and comparing results (kopp et al., 2021; miles et al., 2021). the reason for this inconvenience is that some responses may be correct or incorrect when switching the selection card category. this happens when the chosen stimulus card matches the response card on a different rule that is not used (e.g., select shapes instead of numbers). as a result, these responses are ambiguous and biased (kopp et al., 2021; miles et al., 2021). the rey auditory verbal learning test (ravlt) evaluates episodic memory, verbal, and repeated learning, encoding, retrieval and verbal memory and delayed recall (andersson et al., 2006; ricci et al., 2012; schmidt, 1996). the patients are required to learn a list of 15 words and repeat them in 5 trials. then they must repeat a new list of words they learned in one trial, followed by recalling the first list of words (schmidt, 1996). the test can discriminate between amnestic mci and dementia and between dementia and healthy individuals (andersson et al., 2006; ricci et al., 2012). the scoring is based on individual cut-off scores for each country and demographic group. the test has shown evidence of discriminating between healthy individuals and people with dementia based on recall scores (drolet et al., 2014), also ad and ftd based on recognition scores (van den berg et al., 2020). the ravlt is reliable and valid in screening assessments for dementia, and it has been translated into many languages (fichman et al., 2010; jafari et al., 2010; messinis et al., 2016). the advantages of this test include its ability to indicate cognitive impairment, assess the relationship between memory and learning in patients, and differentiate between different types of dementia (fard et al., 2016; schoenberg et al., 2006; van den berg et al., 2020). however, the test results do not ensure sufficient data to create profiles of cognitive deficits (fard et al., 2016; schoenberg et al., 2006; van den berg et al., 2020). the california verbal learning test (cvlt) measures short and long-delay recall, recognition, episodic verbal learning, memory and encoding (elwood, 1995; libon et al., 1996). the patients are required to recall a list of 16 words in 5 trials. because each word belongs to a semantic category, such as tools, fruits, clothes, spices, and herbs, patients can group the words in each category to help them remember them (elwood, 1995; libon et al., 1996). following trial 5, a new list of words with fruit, spice and herb, fish, and kitchen utensil words is presented. the patients are then asked to recognise words from a 44-word list that is read aloud to them. the words that do not belong to the learning list words are distractors, some of which belong to the same semantic categories, and others sound similar (elwood, 1995). after learning the words, the patients are unaware that a recall and recognition task is required. the test has been simplified for people with dementia to a 9-word list version because the original version was deemed too difficult for old people and people who may have dementia (libon et al., 1996). the scoring is determined using normative datasets. according to the literature, people with ad make many errors during the test, indicating semantic memory impairment (libon et al., 1996). the test can also predict early cognitive impairments associated with semantic memory deficits in individuals (lekeu et al., 2010). the cvlt is reliable and valid in dementia diagnosis and has been translated into many languages (alioto et al., 2017; garcía-herranz et al., 2022). the test is sensitive in measuring episodic memory, it can detect changes in mci to dementia, and it can be used to monitor the dementia stages (fox et al., 1998; lekeu et al., 2010). it is, however, said to be a cognitively demanding test for dementia patients, and more cognitive tests must be added to the cognitive assessment to provide information about cognitive profiles and deficits (fox et al., 1998; lekeu et al., 2010). the boston naming test assesses visual naming ability with black-and-white line drawings (harry & crowe, 2014; hawkins & bender, 2002). 60 black line drawings/pictures aim to identify the level of word-finding ability in patients, and they are presented from the easiest to name to the most difficult (harry & crowe, 2014; hawkins & bender, 2002). each picture is shown one at a time in order, and 176 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ the patient is required to name the item shown in each picture in 20 seconds (harry & crowe, 2014; hawkins & bender, 2002). the scoring is based on correctly identifying the drawings, and normative data is provided for correct results (aniwattanapong et al., 2019; harry & crowe, 2014; hawkins & bender, 2002; rami et al., 2008; ross et al., 1995). based on the literature the boston naming test can differentiate between mci and dementia, especially ad (balthazar et al., 2008). it is reliable and valid and has many translations (aniwattanapong et al., 2019; patricacou et al., 2007). the test’s strength is that it can identify language processing issues because it focuses on naming ability (harry & crowe, 2014; tallberg, 2005). nonetheless, some studies claim that this test may not be the best cognitive assessment to use on its own due to variations in response patterns that may cause interpretation difficulties (harry & crowe, 2014; tallberg, 2005). the alzheimer’s disease assessment scale-cognitive (adas-cog) measures cognitive abilities (connor & sabbagh, 2008; kueper et al., 2018). the assessments include: a word recall task (learn 10 words from cards and recall them in 3 trials), a commands task (carry out 5 commands in 1 to 5 steps), a constructional praxis task (copy 4 geometric forms), a delayed word recall task (recall the 10 words previously learned in word recall task), a naming task (name 12 presented real objects and the fingers of their dominant hand), an ideational praxis task (follow instructions), an orientation task (answer question about time, place and self), comprehension of spoken language, spoken language ability, word-finding difficulty, remembering test instructions and a word recognition task (learn 12 words and recognise them in a list of distractors) (connor & sabbagh, 2008; kueper et al., 2018). during scoring, each item in each task is assessed for its correctness/errors and comprehension of spoken language (understanding the examiner’s instructions and communications), word-finding difficulties, spoken language skills and concentration (connor & sabbagh, 2008; kueper et al., 2018; verma et al., 2015). the test was one of the first to be developed to assess the severity of cognitive impairment and mild to severe ad stages (hannesdóttir & snaedal, 2002; kueper et al., 2018; nogueira et al., 2018). the test is a good predictor of dementia and pre-dementia syndrome diagnoses, such as mci (benge et al., 2009; hannesdóttir & snaedal, 2002; kueper et al., 2018; ulbl & rakusa, 2021). it is reliable and valid, and it has been translated into many languages (chu et al., 2000). the test’s strength is its ability to identify changes in early ad as more items are added (kueper et al., 2018; podhorna et al., 2016). because the test can alter individual result performance and introduce heterogeneity, changes are required to be efficiently employed in diagnostic procedures (kueper et al., 2018; podhorna et al., 2016). the cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery (cantab) is a computer-based assessment of various tests that measure motor skills, executive functions, episodic and visual memory, information processing and sustained attention, valid in diagnosing dementia and translated in many languages (cantab® [cognitive assessment software], 2019, 2022). cantab has validated tests to assess prodromal ad and mci, such as the motor screening task, reaction time task, paired associates learning test, spatial working memory task, pattern recognition memory task, delayed matching to sample test, and rapid visual information processing test (cantab® [cognitive assessment software], 2022). cantab also offers the following tests to distinguish mild to moderate ad: the motor screening task, reaction time task, paired associates learning task, and spatial working memory (cantab® [cognitive assessment software], 2022). each test can be completed in 2 to 8 minutes. the cut-off scores for each group are provided for each cantab test using normative data, and they are based on studies done to identify dementia in individuals using neuropsychological markers (de jager et al., 2005; égerházi et al., 2007; swainson et al., 2001). cantab tests can differentiate between mci and ad, with procedures based on digital testing that are flexible for clinicians during assessments (blackwell et al., 177 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ 2004; égerházi et al., 2007; gualtieri, 2004). however, their weaknesses are that each one tests specific cognitive functions, and each test is not enough alone to contribute to diagnostic procedures (blackwell et al., 2004; égerházi et al., 2007; gualtieri, 2004). the clock drawing test assesses visual-spatial, planning and numerical sequencing skills, as well as long-term attention, concentration, auditory processes and memory, is reliable and valid in dementia diagnosis, and it has been translated into many languages (asl et al., 2018; budson & solomon, 2016; konstam & lehmann, 2011; yap et al., 2007). the patient draws a clock with numbers and clock hands on a piece of paper and places the clock hands at a specific time (budson & solomon, 2016; konstam & lehmann, 2011). the scoring is based on a 10-point scale and takes into account the 12 numbers written on the clock, the size of the clock, the position of the clock hands, the requested hour, the manner in which the figure was drawn, such as graphical errors (khan, 2016). the test has demonstrated sensitivity in detecting dementia, particularly in its early stages (budson & solomon, 2016). the test, however, cannot distinguish between mci and early ad, but it can distinguish between moderate and severe ad (khan, 2016). the strength of the test is that it is a robust screening method for both moderate and severe dementia types (pinto & peters, 2009). evidence suggests the test’s weakness is its inability to distinguish between persons with mild and ambiguous dementia (pinto & peters, 2009). all tests should be administered by a clinical neuropsychologist or another experienced clinician who is a psychometrics expert (hebben & milberg, 2009). furthermore, the examiners must know how to proceed with the testing before each test begins; for example, they must know and be prepared for all sessions (hebben & milberg, 2009; wilson & betteridge, 2019). clinicians must also clearly speak and communicate the instructions for each test (hebben & milberg, 2009). they are also permitted to encourage, motivate, and reinforce the examinees’ efforts to complete each test (wilson & betteridge, 2019). however, it is noteworthy to mention that patients should not view all test kits before testing to reduce bias during data scoring and interpretation (hebben & milberg, 2009). importance of timely diagnosis receiving a dementia diagnosis on time may be critical for patients to access patient care, support, pharmacotherapy, counselling interventions, and information about their disease progression (cummings et al., 2019; downing et al., 2013; sadowsky & galvin, 2012). early diagnosis also benefits families and caregivers because it allows them to make decisions while the patients can still think clearly (davies et al., 2021). this is a critical step because people with dementia lose the ability to make decisions about their own lives (davies et al., 2021). furthermore, the key to diagnosing dementia is assessing the patients’ cognitive skills (hsieh et al., 2015). the cognitive impairment diagnosis then leads to access to therapy plans in healthcare (hsieh et al., 2015). even though neuropsychological assessments do not diagnose an individual independently, they are required to support the diagnosis and prognosis and provide information that will lead to the most appropriate treatment plans. their advantage is that they can detect cognitive deficits caused by brain damage or dysfunction. each country assesses mci and dementia using neuropsychological tests licenced to its national health institutes. in the united kingdom, for example, the national health service (nhs) employs the general practitioner assessment of cognition (gpcog) test, which detects cognitive impairment in individuals but cannot distinguish between groups, such as mci and dementia (national health service, 2020a). moreover, the most common dementia assessments in the australian healthcare system 178 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ are the mmse and adas-cog (dementia australia, 2022). also, clinics and hospitals in the united states use the mmse and mini-cog test, which measure word repetition, recall, and clock drawing, as quick screening procedures to detect mci and early dementia (mini-cog©, 2022). some neuropsychological tests can distinguish between dementia types (matias-guiu et al., 2017; sá et al., 2012; seo et al., 2010; yassuda et al., 2010). for example, there is evidence that the ravlt can differentiate between ad and ftr (ricci et al., 2012). the ravlt reveals more pronounced encoding and retrieval problems in ftd patients than in ad patients and more false positive errors in ad patients than in ftd patients (ricci et al., 2012). the same test may also distinguish between ad and parkinson’s disease dementia (pdd) by revealing more errors in recall in pdd than ad and more errors in recognition in ad than in pdd (tierney et al., 1994). furthermore, the cvlt demonstrates that ad patients make more errors than other dementia patients, indicating a stronger association between semantic memory impairment and ad (davis et al., 2002). it is important to remember that caring for people with dementia includes many growing responsibilities for healthcare providers and caregivers (etters et al., 2008; jönsson & wimo, 2009). the cost of treating and monitoring dementia is high worldwide, posing a financial burden for families, healthcare insurance and hospitals (etters et al., 2008; jönsson & wimo, 2009; kerwin et al., 2022; tahami monfared et al., 2022). according to health economic analysts, the annual costs of screening and monitoring dementia in a patient range from $4.000 to $10.000 in developed countries and ~$1.000 in low-income countries, depending on how mild or severe each case is (mattap et al., 2022). in either case, the economic burden on each country can be enormous, causing delayed screening, diagnostic, and treatment procedures because the number of people with dementia increases over the years (mattap et al., 2022). as a result, solutions and interventions are required to alleviate the heavy load in each household, such as software applications and digitalised cognitive assessments (bojan et al., 2022). however, there are limitations considering neuropsychological testing. emotions and feelings that may bias the screening results and interpretation are usually not meticulously investigated during neuropsychological testing assessments (howieson, 2019). another limitation of the tests is that the information they provide about cognitive profiles is based on specific cognitive domains that they test, which may not be the cognitive domains in which the individual is experiencing symptoms. the mini-ace, for example, can distinguish dementia from mci in individuals with ad and ftd due to memory and language assessments that appear to be impaired in these syndromes (hsieh et al., 2015). therefore, there may be issues when using mini-ace to screen individuals with dementia symptoms due to causes different from ad and ftd, such as vascular disease. moreover, the mmse is a popular cognitive test in healthcare because it is simple and quick to administer and for this reason, it has been used in academia, industry, hospitals, and memory clinics during screening procedures. when compared to other dementia scales, such as the clinical dementia rating (cdr), the mmse may be a good measure for identifying a healthy brain and signs of early dementia (perneczky et al., 2006). however, it is regarded as a poor test for detecting mci from early dementia. the fact that most neuropsychological tests are copyrighted and can be purchased online is a significant limitation of using them in healthcare. as a result, some countries may be unable to purchase licences for the most commonly used neuropsychological tests to aid in diagnosing mci and dementia. naturally, there are some reservations about the limitations and boundaries associated with purchasing assessment tests. patients may receive an incorrect diagnosis, their medical treatments and therapies may be delayed or non-existent, and their quality of life may deteriorate over a period of months to years (howieson, 2019). 179 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ furthermore, some neuropsychological tests may have ambiguous measurement interpretations and no normative data to compare patients’ performance to groups of people in their demographic categories (howieson, 2019). even if there are indications of cut-off scores pointing to specific diagnoses, cultural differences may fail to provide correct interpretations, increasing the possibility of false positive diagnoses (howieson, 2019). this is especially true for neuropsychological tests developed in western cultures and administered in eastern cultures without normative data catalogues. solutions, recommendations, and future research directions neuropsychological testing may be biased due to the limitations and lack of cut-off scores based on cultural differences and identifying emotional and mental state factors that affect testing (howieson, 2019). therefore, researchers must modify and improve tests in various languages (howieson, 2019). furthermore, neuropsychological testing may adopt new and modern psychometric approaches in order to become adaptable to different countries and cultures, as well as effective and efficient in accurate diagnosis (bilder & reise, 2019). to correctly interpret the results, cultural characteristics such as race, ethnicity, acculturation, socioeconomic status, and education should be added to the normative data categories (howieson, 2019). future research may determine the risk factors for individuals developing mci or dementia (kivipelto et al., 2020). for example, individuals with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and vascular issues may be at a high risk of developing mild to severe cognitive impairment due to health issues (kivipelto et al., 2020). furthermore, future research may investigate various interventions, such as how lifestyle factors like physical activity and a healthy diet may improve brain functions (kivipelto et al., 2018, 2020). since there is no research to support the prevention of cognitive impairment through pharmacotherapy, alternative cognitive interventions, such as cognitive simulation and training, might be promising prevention methods in individuals with cognitive impairment as well as healthy individuals (fink et al., 2018; gates et al., 2019). although various solutions assist in reducing the effect of cognitive symptoms, future research could focus on the benefits of personalised and guided study designs to identify biomarkers, risk factors and which interventions are best for each patient (fink et al., 2018). based on the above, neuropsychological testing might be adjusted to differentiate cognitive impairment due to mci and dementia neuropathological profiles due to poor diet, vitamin deficiency, medication side effects etc. conclusion a growing body of research discusses neuropsychological evaluations for cognitive decline in normal ageing, mci, and dementia. memory, attention, orientation, executive functions, reasoning, thinking, language abilities and many more cognitive skills are well assessed. because each test chooses to investigate cognitive impairment in specific cognitive functions, no neuropsychological test can assist in screening and diagnosing an individual with signs of cognitive decline on its own. typically, multiple assessments are performed in conjunction with brain scans and blood tests to provide accurate results. patients’ neuropsychological test scores worsen as their brain health deteriorates, and this has been imprinted in normative data categories and cut-off scores. the most important advantage of these tests is that they identify specific patient profiles and categorise cognitive deficits as mild, moderate, or se180 cognitive assessment tools for dementia in healthcare ﻿ vere, depending on the score. however, not all tests have normative data to compare against, and some cut-off scores have yet to be adjusted for different languages and cultures. as a result of the foregoing, many implications emerge, such as delayed correct diagnosis, receiving appropriate treatment, and being involved in overall decision-making in one’s own life. overall, the benefits of using neuropsychological assessments in individuals with cognitive deterioration are critical in understanding the patients’ needs and implementing appropriate interventions to alleviate the negative impact of their symptoms. references alexopoulos, p., grimmer, t., perneczky, r., domes, g., & kurz, a.

in men, it was the pain variation rate. association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty: a study based on a classification and regression tree ana paula fontes https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4431-5229 university of algarve, portugal ana marreiros https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9410-4772 university of algarve, portugal marina gueorguieva kovatchki university of algarve, portugal nuno césar barbosa vila franca de xira hospital, portugal daniel bernardino vila franca de xira hospital, portugal acácio ramos vila franca de xira hospital, portugal joão paulo sousa algarve private hospital, portugal 193 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ introduction osteoarthritis (oa) is the most common musculoskeletal condition and is characterized by multiple impairments of structures and functions, progressing to joint damage that, over time, becomes irreversible, significantly impacting individuals’ performance of activities and quality of life. in the case of knee oa, the most common manifestations comprise pain, stiffness, loss of mobility, and disability in activities of daily living, for which the standard surgical treatment in the terminal phase is total knee arthroplasty (tka).about 33.6% of the population aged 65 and older suffer from oa (lawrence et al., 2008), whose risk to the knee is lifelong; when comparing men and women, 40 and 47%, respectively, are affected by this comorbidity, whose effects are exacerbated by obesity (neogi & zhang, 2013). the pathophysiology of oa is complex and includes mechanisms of cellular stress and degradation of the extracellular matrix, with maladaptive responses from innate immunity and significant repercussions at the cartilage level and in other joint structures, including subchondral bone, menisci, ligaments, synovial membrane, and synovial fluid (brandt et al., 2006). the higher prevalence of oa in females is related to hormonal physiology and anatomical specificities. genes that code for estrogen receptors increase the risk of oa, and women have thinner articular cartilages, a q angle that is about 3° higher than men, a narrower and shorter distal femur, and a difference in the size of the tibial plates (hitt et al., 2003). obesity is commonly associated with hip and knee oa due to the implicit overload it causes these joints. however, other justifications for its association are related to biological mechanisms, such as cartilage growth and bone factors, whose higher presence in obesity precipitates joint degradation (felson, 1992). another factor related to knee oa is traumatic injuries throughout the life cycle, specifically those involving the menisci and anterior cruciate ligament. a meniscal lesion or partial meniscectomy tends to potentiate the onset of oa due to the close kinematic relationship between the menisci and articular cartilage (madry et al., 2012). nevertheless, ajuied et al. (2014) reported that anterior cruciate ligament injuries increase the risk of knee oa by 3.89 due to the instability they cause in this joint by changing the load-bearing area to the periphery, thus overloading the articular cartilage in this region (heijink et al., 2012). total knee arthroplasty is one of the most performed musculoskeletal surgeries and is considered a highly effective intervention. it provides overall good functional results and high satisfaction levels. in the last decade, tkas have increased exponentially due to the aging population, increased prevalence of obesity, and leisure activities (murphy & helmick, 2012; united states bone and joint initiative, 2014). despite providing high levels of satisfaction, various studies have reported that 20–30% of patients are dissatisfied, with surgeons curiously expressing higher levels of satisfaction with the results obtained compared to patients (bourne et al., 2010; canovas & dagneaux, 2018; dunbar et al., 2013; gunaratne et al., 2017; khatib et al., 2020). although numerous factors influence patient satisfaction, one of the main reasons for dissatisfaction is high patient expectations. when these patients do not achieve the expected results, they may be ten times more likely to be dissatisfied with their treatment outcome (canovas & dagneaux, 2018). however, these expectations relate to pain relief, improved physical capacity, and improved psychosocial well-being. other factors contributing to dissatisfaction include demographic factors such as age and sex and functional factors such as residual pain, stiffness and inflammation, low postoperative functional capacity, and postoperative complications (bourne et al., 2010; canovas & dagneaux, 2018). addressing expectations in a preoperative consultation to ensure realistic expectations has been reported to be beneficial. this action, along with users’ participation in postoperative rehabilitation 194 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ programs, is vital for surgical success and improving satisfaction rates (bourne et al., 2010; bryan et al., 2018; filbay et al., 2018; genêt et al., 2008; hamilton et al., 2013; husain & lee, 2015; thambiah et al., 2015). given the above, the primary objective of this study was to know the relationship between the functionality achieved at 90 days (d90) after surgery and personal satisfaction. the secondary objectives were identifying the variables that differentiate satisfaction levels and determining sex differences. materials and methods a) study design this is an observational and retrospective study (level of evidence iii) implemented using variables collected in the department of orthopedics of the hospital particular do algarve (faro, portugal) database concerning patients undergoing tka between 2018 and 2021; the sample consisted of 183 patients. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital particular do algarve, and patients and professionals allowed their data to be used through informed consent in force at the institution. the functional variables were knee pain intensity, knee range of motion (passive flexion and extension), gait distance, pain and stiffness symptomatology, and activity performance using the western ontario and mcmaster university osteoarthritis (womac) index. the patients’ functionality was assessed between 7–15 days before surgery and 3 months after the intervention; personal satisfaction was collected at the follow-up time. the preoperative assessment also included an educational session: teaching isometric contractions of the major muscle groups of the lower limb, teaching active mobilization of the lower limb joints, sitting/standing training, getting in/out of bed training, and gait training with crutches on the ground and stairs. at the end of the session, the patient received a brochure explaining the entire course of the intervention and the rehabilitation program (the one applied during hospitalization and the one that the patient should continue at home). the surgical team always consisted of the same professionals and was supervised by a senior surgeon; the rehabilitation team included two physical therapists. b) population and sample the population included 193 patients, and only the patients that completely fulfilled the variables under study were included in the sample (by convenience) for all the different data collection moments. for the inclusion criteria, we also considered patients whose reason for surgery was symptomatic arthrosis resistant to conservative treatment. thus, the sample was composed of 183 patients. c) measuring instruments data collection included measurement instruments collected by the physical therapist (performancebased measures of physical function) and patient-reported assessments (patient-reported measures), as recommended in the literature. the first group of variables included measuring the range of motion of knee flexion and extension by goniometric recording and the six-minute walk test (6mwt). the reported assessment considered pain intensity through the visual analog scale (vas), the womac index as a multidimensional instrument to assess functioning, and personal satisfaction through a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. the goniometric assessment was recorded by active mobilization according to the 195 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ protocol described by norkin and white (2009) for the mobile and fixed positioning of the goniometer and recording the range of motion. adequate reliability was found in the literature, with a coefficient of 0.96 for flexion and 0.81 for extension in a cohort of patients with oa (cibere et al., 2004). in the context of tka, active knee flexion has an intraclass coefficient of correlation of good reliability for the immediate postoperative and post-acute settings (lenssen et al., 2007; jakobsen et al., 2010). regarding the extent and according to the same authors, the reliability of this active measuring mode is moderate in acute settings and good in outpatient settings (lenssen et al., 2007; jakobsen et al., 2010). both studies concluded that the goniometric reliability of passive knee extension is poorer than that of active knee extension, although both passive and active knee flexion show good reliability (jakobsen et al., 2010; lenssen et al., 2007). similar findings were reported by stratford et al. (2010) for active measurements after tka; the authors found that flexion had a good test-retest reliability (0.84) for a minimum detectable difference of 9.6°, while these values were 0.6 and 6.3° for extension, respectively. although the 6mwt was initially adopted in the context of patients with cardiorespiratory dysfunctions, it is now widespread in various disease conditions and contexts and even in healthy populations. it is a timed test that measures the distance the individual can walk for six minutes on flat, even surfaces. the individual, according to the protocol, has the possibility of using walking aids and receiving incentives (standardized in time) so that the route covered is as long as possible (american thoracic society, 2002). various studies have included the 6mwt to analyze post-tka performance due to the test’s reliability over time. nevertheless, some researchers have reported that the 6mwt only moderately correlates with the multidimensional measures of self-reported functioning in tka assessments (parent & moffet, 2002), leading one to conclude that these instruments measure different aspects of ability/performance. therefore, both methods should be considered in tka assessments and interventions (kennedy et al., 2006). the vas was used for its simplicity and for being widely adopted in the literature. the patient is asked to rate the intensity of their pain by placing a mark on a horizontal or vertical 100-mm long line, where one end of the line represents no pain, and the other represents the most intense pain imaginable. pain intensity is quantified by measuring the distance (using a ruler) in millimeters from the end of the line, represented by “no pain,” to the mark placed by the patient (hawker et al., 2011). higher scores on the vas indicate greater pain intensity. the minimum clinically important change in pain intensity measured using the vas and in patients with knee oa is 19.9 mm (tubach et al., 2005). in this study, knee pain intensity at rest was collected, and the values were recorded in the database in centimeters. the womac is one of the most widely used instruments to assess functionality in hip and knee oa, including situations where the prosthetic solution has already been established. the instrument was in 1982 and has undergone several versions. the womac can be self-administered, although it has also been validated for telephone interview and digital application; it is composed of three domains/dimensions with a total of twenty-four items: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function/activities (17 items) (collins et al., 2011). responses can be given using a five-option likert scale or a 100-mm visual analog scale (collins et al., 2011). in this study, the likert scale was chosen, ranging from “no pain/stiffness intensity or no difficulty” (value 0) to “very intense pain/stiffness/difficulty” (value 4), in which lower scores correspond to higher functional levels. thus, the domain scores range from 0 to 20 for pain, 0 to 8 for stiffness, and 0 to 68 for activities, generating a total score between 0–96. 196 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ notably, the questionnaire should be considered invalid if two or more pain items, both stiffness items, or four or more activity items are missing (collins et al., 2011). despite the overall good psychometric characteristics attributed to the womac, some authors have raised concerns about the possibility that its domains may produce floor or ceiling effects at certain points. for instance, escobar et al. (2007) and impellizzeri et al. (2011) stated that ceiling effects have been reported in various studies for all domains at 6 months and 2 years after tka. regarding the ability to detect changes in the individuals’ capacity/ performance — an aspect that in recent years has gained prominence in interpreting the results from minimal detectable change or minimum clinically important difference (mcid) — the values vary according to the time of progression. according to collins et al. (2011), the mcid (0–100 scale) for six months after surgery could be considered: 22.87 for pain, 14.43 for stiffness, and 19.01 for activities. at the end of one year, these values should be 36 for pain and 33 for activities, respectively. although the scientific community recognizes the many advantages of using the womac, it also acknowledges some of its shortcomings, specifically in the domain of activities: i) some tasks cannot be regularly performed (assessed) in all individuals or all contexts (e.g., climbing/descending stairs or bathing), ii) the content validity does not seem to be guaranteed for more physically active individuals, as it does not include sufficiently difficult or complex functional tasks, and iii) a rasch analysis concluded that there are redundant tasks (collins et al., 2011). nevertheless, numerous rheumatologists have questioned the reliability of the stiffness domain, despite the consistent internal consistency reported in the literature. the most used patient-reported outcome measures (proms) to assess satisfaction include the 36- item short form health survey (sf-36), the 12-item short form health survey (sf-12), the womac index, the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos), and the oxford knee score (oks) (choi & ra, 2016). in this study, the womac was chosen as an instrument capable of measuring the effectiveness of surgery and non-surgical interventions, as it is statistically considered to be one of the predictors of satisfaction. satisfaction as a dependent variable was collected using a numeric rating scale of 0–10, where “0” corresponded to “totally dissatisfied” and “10” to “totally satisfied,” with higher scores representing higher satisfaction. the numeric rating scale is commonly used for self-reporting subjective patient conditions (satisfaction, pain, need for analgesia, breathing difficulty) because of its many advantages: ease of administration and scoring, multiple response options, and lack of age-related difficulties. d) variables the following variables were considered: i) sociodemographic: age, sex, body mass index (bmi), and “with whom you live” (alone or with others). ii) perioperative: laterality of the operated knee and length of hospitalization. iii) functional: knee joint flexion and extension; 6mwt; pain; womac index, through the partial score of each dimension (pain, stiffness, and activities) and its total score. iv) functional evolution: 6mwt rate of change, pain degree rate, and womac score rate of change. v) personal satisfaction. 197 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ e) statistical analysis the database was anonymized before the descriptive and inferential statistical analysis using the spss® 28 software (ibm inc., armonk, ny). as for the descriptive statistics, we considered the mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range, and absolute and relative frequencies for each dependent variable. for the statistical inference processes and after being tested for normality of all variables, the following tests were applied: chi-square, student-t for independent samples, and one-way analysis of variance (anova) on the variables that revealed normal distribution. the mann-whitney test and paired samples were applied for paired data (pre- and postoperative) in the variables where normality was not verified. in bivariate terms, spearman’s test was calculated to analyze the coefficient of correlation between the differences in the mean values and rates of change of the functionality variables and satisfaction. the multivariate statistics included a clustering analysis to understand if the levels of significant association (between the functionality variables and satisfaction) were associated with a specific patient profile by applying the classification and regression tree (crt) method. the results were considered statistically significant whenever p < 0.05 except for the coefficient of correlation, where p < 0.01 was also considered (these exceptions are duly identified). results most of the patients were women, totaling 115 (62.8%). the mean age was similar between sexes (p = 0.627): 70.3 ± 7.4 years in women and 70.9 ± 8.1 years in men. a higher prevalence of bmi was observed in the subgroup of bmi >30 kg/m2, with a total of 82 (46.6%) patients, with no difference between sexes (p = 0.055). out of the total number of patients, roughly 85% had a partner; of the men, only 5% lived alone, and for women, this percentage was significantly higher (p = 0.006), with a value above 20%. the mean length of stay was 2.8 ± 1.2 days, with no differences between women and men (p = 0.168). table 1 lists all the results of the sample characterization, differentiated between women and men. the evolution of pre- and postoperative functionality is shown in table 2. overall, significant improvements were observed in all variables except for the range of motion for the total sample and comparative analysis between sexes. women and men were comparatively analyzed for baseline and acquired functionality at d90 (table 2). the initial assessment revealed that the range of motion and pain were similar between the sexes, while the remaining variables were significantly more positive for the men. in the final evaluation, the mean values achieved were identical between women and men except for 6mwt, which revealed higher values in men. all results are presented in table 3. in order to better understand the functional evolution between women and men, the differences in the mean values achieved in each of the variables and the respective rates of change were compared. the results revealed that, overall, women improved more than men, achieving significant mean differences in pain (7.4 ± 3.6 vs 6.2 ± 4.1; p = 0.035), activities (22 ± 13.4 vs 16.9 ± 11.2; p = 0.009), and total womac score (30.9 ± 17.5 vs 24.2 ± 15.1; p = 0.009). regarding the variation rates, no significant differences were found between the sexes, although the women tended to show more positive values in the functional evolution except for pain. as for personal satisfaction, the results were identical for both sexes. this analysis is listed in table 4. 198 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ the frequency distribution of satisfaction values for women and men is shown in table 5. the lowest satisfaction value in women was “4” with an absolute frequency of 1, while in men, this value was “5” with an absolute frequency of 2. the value for both sexes was “10,” with an absolute frequency of 49 in women (42.6%) and 24 in men (35.3%). the satisfaction value “8” was the second most assigned score for both sexes. table 2. pre- and postoperative functionality evolution total n = 183 women n = 115 (62.8%) men n = 68 (37.2%) functionality evolution pre-op post-op p-value pre-op post-op p-value pre-op post-op p-value flexion 108 ± 21 107 ± 13 0.5431 107 ± 21 107 ± 12 1.0001 111 ± 20 108 ± 14 0.3211 extension 3 ± 5 3 ± 4 0.2071 3 ± 5 2 ± 4 0.2011 3 ± 5 3 ± 5 0.7751 6mwt 266 ± 100 295 ± 90 <0.0011 247 ± 88 278 ± 75 0.0011 300 ± 110 323 ± 105 0.0191 vas 5.3 ± 2.2 1.4 ± 2 <0.0011 5.4 ± 2.3 1.4 ± 2 <0.0011 4.9 ± 2.2 1.3 ± 1.9 <0.0011 womac - pain 9.9 ± 3.2 3 ± 2.7 <0.0011 10.4 ± 3.2 3.0 ± 2.8 <0.0011 9.1 ± 3.0 2.9 ± 2.5 <0.0011 womac - stiffness 2.8 ± 1.9 1.6 ± 1.3 <0.0011 3 ± 1.9 1.6 ± 1.3 <0.0011 2.5 ± 1.8 1.5 ± 1.3 <0.0031 womac - activities 32.4 ± 11.7 12.2 ± 9.4 <0.0011 34.4 ± 11.7 12.4 ± 8.7 <0.0011 28.9 ± 10.8 11.9 ± 10.5 <0.0011 womac - total 45.1 ± 15.2 16.7 ± 11.9 <0.0011 47.8 ± 15.4 17 ± 11.6 <0.0011 40.4 ± 13.9 16.2 ± 12.6 <0.0011 1nonparametric tests: related samples table 1. sample characterization total n = 183 women n = 115 (62.8%) men n = 68 (37.2%) p-value age 70.5 ± 7.6 70.3 ± 7.4 70.9 ± 8.1 0.6271 bmi <25 23.3 ± 1.0;

the association was always positive, with its weakest rate of change in the 6mwt (rs = 0.275) and the highest value in the womac stiffness rate of change (rs = 0.524). as for the women, no correlation was observed between satisfaction and the following variables: mean value difference and rate of change in the 6mwt, mean value difference in the vas, and mean value difference in the womac stiffness. the remaining functional variables correlated with satisfaction, and their association was also always positive, with values between rs = 0.218 for the difference in the mean value of the womac pain and rs = 0.405 for the rate of change in the womac total score. all correlation values between satisfaction and functionality are presented in table 6. table 3. comparison of functional evaluations (pre- and postoperative) between women and men functional evaluations women/men p-value flexion preoperative 0.2121 postoperative 0.7421 extension preoperative 0.8311 postoperative 0.5901 6mwt preoperative <0.0011 postoperative 0.0031 vas preoperative 0.1191 postoperative 0.9221 womac - pain preoperative 0.0081 postoperative 0.9811 womac - stiffness preoperative 0.0401 postoperative 0.7161 womac - activities preoperative 0.0021 postoperative 0.3311 womac - total preoperative 0.0021 postoperative 0.4561 1mann-whitney 200 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ in order to analyze how the independent variables interacted with the dependent variable (personal satisfaction), a multivariate analysis was employed by using the crt method, which, through a decision tree, ranks the discriminative power of the selected dependent variable to understand the interaction between the independent or explanatory variables. in women, the first level of differentiation was the rate of change in the womac activity score, which was split between ≤58.9 and >58.9%. in the ≤58.9% split, the satisfaction value that was repeated most often was “8” (35%). above 58.9%, the satisfaction value most often observed was “10” (62.5%). the next level of differentiation was the rate of change of the womac pain score, divided between ≤96.2 and >96.2%; the most prevalent satisfaction value in these two divisions was “10.” in men, the first level of differentiation was the rate of change of the womac pain score, which was split between ≤80.9 and >80.9%. in the division ≤80.9%, the satisfaction value that was repeated more often corresponded to “8” (40.6%), while in the division >80.9%, this value was “10” (78.3%). as a second level of differentiation, the rate of change of the womac stiffness score appeared and was divided between ≤29.2 and >29.2%, in which the most observed values were “7” (30%) and “8” (58.3%), respectively. table 4. comparison of the differences in mean values and rates of change of the variables of functionality and satisfaction achieved in the d90 between women and men variables of functionality and satisfaction total (n = 183) women n = 115 (62.8%) men n = 68 (37,2%) p-value 6mwt difference 30.0 ± 75.9 31.5 ± 70.6 27.4 ± 84.6 0.7271 6mwt rate of change (%) 9.0 ± 27.6 10.1 ± 27.8 7.0 ± 27.4 0.5682 vas difference 3.9 ± 2.9 4.1 ± 3.0 3.7 ± 3.0 0.4372 vas rate of change (%) 70.3 ± 55.8 69.0 ± 49.8 72.5 ± 65.1 0.5842 womac difference - pain 7.0 ± 3.8 7.4 ± 3.6 6.2 ± 4.1 0.0351 womac rate of change - pain (%) 67.4 ± 36.4 70.8 ± 28.1 61.6 ± 46.8 0.3092 womac difference - stiffness 1.2 ± 2.0 1.4 ± 2.0 0.9 ± 2.0 0.1702 womac rate of change - stiffness (%) 46.2 ± 51.2 49.7 ± 44.5 39.9 ± 61.4 0.6032 womac difference - activities 20.1 ± 12.8 22.0 ± 13.4 16.9 ± 11.2 0.0091 womac rate of change - activities (%) 59.5 ± 33.8 60.5 ± 33.6 57.9 ± 33.5 0.5362 womac difference - total 28.4 ± 16.9 30.9 ± 17.5 24.2 ± 15.1 0.0091 womac rate of change - total (%) 60.7 ± 29.5 62.3 ± 28.6 58.1 ± 31.2 0.3842 satisfaction 8.8 ± 1.4 8.8 ± 1.4 8.6 ± 1.5 0.3642 1t-student |2mann-whitney 201 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ table 5. frequency distribution of the satisfaction variable for women and men frequency percentage valid percentage cumulative percentage women valid 4 1 0.9 1.0 1.0 5 2 1.7 1.9 2.9 6 4 3.5 3.8 6.7 7 9 7.8 8.7 15.4 8 24 20.9 23.1 38.5 9 15 13.0 14.4 52.9 10 49 42.6 47.1 100.0 total 104 90.4 100.0 missing 999 11 9.6 total 115 100.0 men valid 5 2 2.9 3.6 3.6 6 2 2.9 3.6 7.3 7 8 11.8 14.5 21.8 8 15 22.1 27.3 49.1 9 4 5.9 7.3 56.4 10 24 35.3 43.6 100.0 total 55 80.9 100.0 missing 999 13 19.1 total 13 68 100.0 total valid 4 1 0.5 0.6 0.6 5 4 2.2 2.5 3.1 6 6 3.3 3.8 6.9 7 17 9.3 10.7 17.6 8 39 21.3 24.5 42.1 9 19 10.4 11.9 54.1 10 73 39.9 45.9 100.0 total 159 86.9 100.0 missing 999 24 13.1 total 183 100.0 202 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ discussion a) functioning acquired on d90 significant improvements in functionality were observed, as described in most studies, except for flexion and extension range of motion. regarding flexion, we found that the average baseline value was higher than in most studies (>107° for women and 111° for men), leading us to speculate that this variable would not have a priori an important margin to evolve in this period. indeed, at 3 months post operation, we can assume that the results were almost unchanged from the values before the surgery and close to 1–2-year follow-ups, as reported by anwar et al. (2016) and reimann et al. (2019). for parsley et al. (1992), when the preoperative flexion is >105°, the expected evolution in the first months will be less compared to patients with this more diminished function. according to berend (2010), patients with higher preoperative mobility (116–122°) tend to lose a few degrees after tka. in the case of the present study and according to the same author, the predicted increase in flexion would be +3° (predicted increase for baseline values between 103 and 115°). table 6. correlation between personal satisfaction and functionality for women and men total (n = 183) women n = 115 (62.8%) men n = 68 (37,2%) coefficient correlation p-value coefficient correlation p-value coefficient correlation p-value 6mwt difference and satisfaction 0.193 0.015* 0.151 0.1318 0.280 0.038* 6mwt rate of change and satisfaction 0.185 0.021* 0.144 0.1498 0.275 0.042* vas difference and satisfaction 0.167 0.035* 0.093 0.3458 0.292 0.030* vas rate of change and satisfaction 0.383 <0.001** 0.342 <0.001** 0.484 <0.001** womac difference - pain and satisfaction 0.277 <0.001** 0.218 0.026* 0.374 0.005** womac rate of change - pain and satisfaction 0.445 <0.001** 0.396 <0.001** 0.514 <0.001** womac difference - stiffness and satisfaction 0.211 <0.001** 0.084 0.3978 0.419 0.001** womac rate of change - stiffness and satisfaction 0.349 <0.001** 0.256 0.017* 0.524 <0.0018** womac difference - activities and satisfaction 0.355 <0.001** 0.344 <0.001** 0.356 0.0088** womac rate of change - activities and satisfaction 0.401 <0.001** 0.398 <0.001** 0.421 0.001** womac difference - total and satisfaction 0.358 <0.001* 0.318 0.001** 0.403 0.002** womac rate of change - total and satisfaction 0.431 <0.001** 0.405 <0.001** 0.487 <0.001** * significant correlation at the level of *0.05 | **0.01 203 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ it is also important to mention that the values observed in flexion can likely be considered stabilized; however, one must bear in mind that some authors believe that the time window necessary for flexion to evolve most significantly is the first 3 months after surgery (mehta et al., 2020; mutsuzaki et al., 2017). small gains may still be seen for up to 6 months, which will tend to consolidate after 1 year (mehta et al., 2020; mutsuzaki et al., 2017). if this assumption is true, perhaps future difficulties will be observed in performing tasks such as putting on socks/shoes, squatting to pick up an object from the floor, or getting in/out of a car. the extension also showed identical values between the pre- and postoperative periods, which may be related to the difficulty in gaining strength by the extensor apparatus after a tka. indeed, the meta-analysis by moon et al. (2016) draws interesting conclusions on this subject that are worth noting; the temporal behavior of the force excursion of the quadriceps and ischiotibial muscles over time is identical, with maximum decreases observed at 3 months and recovery to preoperative levels at 6 months. nevertheless, the decreased quadriceps strength is 2–3 times more severe than the ischiotibial muscles. these physiological findings may influence the decrease in active capacity in knee extension. b) absolute gains in acquired functioning on d90 when comparing women and men when the absolute gains acquired o d90 were evaluated between women and men, through the difference of the mean value and rate of change, we observed that they were higher in women for the womac variables (pain, activities, and total score). sex as a predictor of functional outcomes is controversial in the literature. the guideline by jette et al. (2020) states that there is no consensus on this factor, as both sexes may be related to better or worse performance after tka depending on the outcome measures used. however, the authors mentioned two high-quality studies comparing men and women. the first study refers to naylor et al. (2012), in which women scored worse on the oks and men showed worse values in knee extension, while the second study, by sullivan et al. (2009), revealed that women reported higher levels of pain at 6-weeks of follow-up. in the present study, our findings contradict these data, perhaps due to the women beginning the baseline assessment with worse functionality levels in these variables and were, therefore, able to gain more from the surgical intervention. c) satisfaction the average level of satisfaction was good for both sexes, as 84.6% of women and 78.2% of men scored satisfaction with ≥8 values. although many studies have reported higher levels of dissatisfaction for women, our results contradict this conclusion; even without significant differences, women were more satisfied than men. this value may be justified by the differences and rates of change that were globally higher in women, indicating more evident improvements in the female sex. while searching for studies to support this study, only one article was found that relates the pre- and postoperative womac scale to personal satisfaction. walker et al. (2018) found that patients with a higher score between the preoperative and one-year postoperative scores on the womac index demonstrated higher satisfaction than those with a lower score. thambiah et al. (2015) also corroborate this conclusion, as the author observed that patients with a lower womac score at the end of one year after surgery are more satisfied than those with a higher score. the present study supports these results because the differences in all domains and the total of the womac scale were statistically significantly correlated with satisfaction except for the difference in 204 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ the stiffness domain for the women. postoperative stiffness, caused by a muscle imbalance between the extensor and flexor muscles, is quite common and one of the indications for participation in a rehabilitation program. d) classification and regression tree several authors have described the womac domains and total score as important predictors of satisfaction (giesinger et al., 2015; liu et al., 2021; walker et al., 2018). pain was the common and important discrimination variable for satisfaction for both sexes, although with different manifestations, thereby corroborating various studies (bryan et al., 2018; dunbar et al., 2013; husain & lee, 2015; lau et al., 2012). pain is the most common symptom and the most influential decision-maker for patients to accept undergoing tka, being one of the most important and valued outcomes. most authors have described pain reduction or disappearance as the most prevalent expectation of knee oa patients and, when achieved, with positive repercussions on activity performance and satisfaction. in women, activity performance was the variable with the highest explanatory power for high satisfaction levels. indeed, as reported in numerous studies, improved activity performance comes after decreased pain as the most important variable for satisfaction (dunbar et al., 2013; halawi et al., 2019; lau et al., 2012; walker et al., 2018). in men, stiffness emerged as the variable that best explains the high satisfaction levels, and the perception of stiffness is associated with activity performance, namely walking speed. in our study, men showed a significant improvement in these variables, which may explain why stiffness is important for satisfaction. limitations the authors admit there may be some limitations in this study: i) we did not know if the patients had integrated rehabilitation programs or in which modalities they had done so; ii) we did not consider comorbidities as an essential variable for the functionality achieved and satisfaction; iii) since this was a comparative study between sexes, the sample size could have been more balanced; iv) expectations were not assessed preoperatively, nor were we asked whether expectations were met after surgery; finally, v) we assessed satisfaction after 3 months; perception regarding pain and performance in activities may continue to improve and promote satisfaction; therefore, a longer follow-up would have been a good strategy. conclusion patient satisfaction is an important outcome measure after total knee arthroplasty, and the womac index plays an important role in predicting satisfaction. women and men have high satisfaction levels after tka, although the determinants contributing to this variable have different manifestations. for women, what most contributes to satisfaction is the improvement in the performance of activities and decreased pain, while for men, it is the improvement in pain and stiffness symptoms. 205 association between the acquired functioning and personal satisfaction ﻿ funding no external funding was received in this study. conflicts of interest each author certifies that there are no commercial associations (e.g., consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangements, etc.) that might conflict with the submitted article. ethical approval the institution approved the human protocol for this investigation. all investigations were conducted per ethical research principles, and informed consent was obtained. references ajuied, a., wong, f., smith, c., norris, m., earnshaw, p., back, d., & davies, a.

how they affect patient satisfaction and responsiveness. to address the objective, the study adopted a systematic literature approach to review 20 related studies, selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the prisma flowchart, and analysed using thematic analysis. the study revealed several variables that included institutional factors, quality dimensions, and socioeconomic factors had a relationship with service quality in healthcare delivery which influences patients’ perception, care experiences, and the quality of services they receive. therefore, it is recommended that the management of hospitals consider these variables and socioeconomic factors like age, cultural beliefs, level of education, income, and occupation of patients to provide health personnel a better understanding of patients and treat them based on their specific needs when providing general services. factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare: a systematic

introduction the satisfaction of clients is one essential factor to the success of every organisation. this is because when a client is satisfied there is a tendency for the client to repeat the services being provided. in the health sector, client or patient satisfaction is used to measure whether available healthcare systems meet the health needs and expectations of patients (adua et al., 2017). according to adhikary et al., (2018), patient satisfaction is a valuable indicator of quality and effective health services as it affects the health outcome of patients. patient satisfaction is described as the measure of the extent to which a patient is content with the kind of services, they received from their healthcare provider (yaya et al., 2017). in other words, when the services rendered by healthcare providers meet or exceed the expectation of a patient then patient satisfaction is said to be achieved. as a key determinant of quality in healthcare delivery, patient satisfaction has been accepted worldwide and is continuously becoming a part of standards for training healthcare providers and health institutions. in developed countries, healthcare providers are expected to be patient-focused as it promotes patient satisfaction (wu et al., 2021). this is because satisfied patients are more likely to be loyal to health service providers, build a good relationship with health systems leading to improved services and high patient satisfaction and loyalty rate. thus, adhikary et al., (2018) explain that in developed countries, one of the ways satisfaction is improved is by paying attention to feedback from patients who visit health facilities. on the other hand, patient satisfaction is remarkably low in most developing countries because most healthcare facilities in africa are not patient-centred which has led to poor quality healthcare resulting in loss of trust and respect, resources, community apathy, patient lives, time as well as negative hospital reputation (kokou et al., 2015). also, a study revealed that there is wide diversity when it comes to patient satisfaction and this can be seen in the area of emergency patients, inpatients, and outpatients but the study focused on inpatient satisfaction (chen et al., 2016). thus, the study revealed that doctors’ service attitudes, environment, nurses’ attitudes, expenditures, and sex were factors that influenced the rate of patient satisfaction in china. these studies suggest that high patient satisfaction can be attained if factors that influence patient satisfaction are identified and implemented or avoided. problem statement patient satisfaction has been remarkably low in most developing countries leading to competition between private and public health institutions. woldeyohanes et al., (2015) stated that private health institutions are noted to deliver quality health services as compared to public health institutions. in a study by chen et al., (2016), although the study was conducted on factors influencing patients’ satisfaction, the study focused on only inpatients leaving out emergency patients and outpatients, therefore, limiting the scope of the study which can limit the generalisation of results. similarly, the focus of salehi et al., (2018) study was on inpatient only even though the study adopted a systematic literature review, limiting the review to only inpatients meant the study did not explore every aspect of a health system to ascertain all the factors influencing patients’ satisfaction. again, chandra et al., (2019) study on the factors influencing patient satisfaction also focused only on out-patients, therefore, limiting identifying factors across health systems. 213 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ the above stated issues have created a need to conduct this study to ensure that every aspect of a health system is captured in identifying the factors that influence patient satisfaction, to explore and examine healthcare quality dimensions, using a systematic review with the general objective being to understand the measures of person-centred healthcare quality variables and how these variables affect patient satisfaction and responsiveness. to achieve this aim, three specific objectives were developed which included examining the variables/ factors that have been indicated by literature to influence patient satisfaction in healthcare, determining how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare, and determining the relationship between socio-economic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. conceptual framework the empirical review presents several studies that have been carried out concerning the variables/factors that influence patient satisfaction in healthcare, how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare, and the relationship between service quality and socio-economic factors in healthcare delivery. this section presents the illustration of the relationship existing between patient satisfaction and healthcare delivery. the relationship is however diagrammatically represented below. figure 2.1 illustrates the influence socio-economic factors and quality dimensions have on the satisfaction of patients. the framework also suggests that patient satisfaction represents the dependent variable whose outcome is dependent on the variables associated with it (independent). thus, the independent variable is that which causes the patient satisfaction level to change. the illustration is in line with studies whose results identified privacy settings, facility cleanliness, interpersonal skills, quality of medical services, price of medical services, staff competence, patient waiting time, and convenient opening hours among others as the key drivers of patient satisfaction in healthcare (adhikary et al., 2018; fang et al., 2019; katuti, 2018). similarly, the framework also suggests that socioeconomic variables such as income, education, age, and occupation influence patient’s satisfaction regarding healthcare delivery which agrees with study results by aloh et al. (2020), arpey et al. (2017), as well as xesfingi and vozikis (2016). in the nutshell, the two (socio-economic factors and service quality dimensions) have a relationship that significantly influences patient satisfaction. methodology this section presents the methods that are used to collect and analyse data, a research design is presented as well as a section on quality assessment. the chapter also covers the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in selecting studies, research evidence, selected studies, and data analysis. research design the study adopted an exploratory research design to create the foundation for understanding the measures of person-centred healthcare quality variables. according to creswell and creswell (2018), an exploratory research design is a research design that explores a topic with varying levels of depth. with the exploratory research design, the study adopted a systematic literature review in data collection and 214 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ analysis. a systematic literature review is a critical and reproducible summary of findings from published studies on a specific topic (creswell, 2017). quality assessment to assess the quality of the studies used for the review, the study adopted a quality assessment tool known as the critical appraisal skills programme (casp). casp is a checklist that is used to assess the quality of the studies being included in a review, thus, it is used in studies like qualitative studies, figure 1. conceptual framework of the factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare source: author’s construct (2021) 215 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ systematic studies, case-control studies, randomised controlled trials, and cohort studies (critical appraisal skills programme, 2018). the study made use of the casp tool because it helped the researcher identify relevant studies and avoid the situation of including low-quality studies that can affect the outcome of this research. inclusion and exclusion criteria this section presents the inclusion and exclusion criteria that were used to select the related studies. bryman and bell (2015) describe inclusion criteria as characteristics a researcher looks out for in prospective studies to justify their inclusion in a study whereas exclusion criteria are characteristics that disqualify studies from being included in a review as they do not meet the characteristics a researcher wants in prospective studies. the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the research are presented in table 1. research evidence to conduct the literature search, specific search engines were used to help identify the studies for the review. the search engines used included google scholar, sciencedirect, pubmed, and cochrane library. to identify the studies, the researcher made use of boolean operators to narrow the scope and made the search easier. to use the boolean operators, the study made use of conjunctions like “or”, “and”, “not” and “and/or”. also, to narrow the search, keywords like “pdf”, “thesis”, “full-text” and “journal” were added to the search. other keywords used were derived from the research objectives and they include “patient satisfaction in healthcare”, “quality dimensions that affect patient satisfaction”, “relationship between socio-economic factors and service quality” and “service quality in healthcare”. in table 2, a breakdown of the search engines used is presented as well as phrases or words used for the searches, the number of hits, and the number of studies selected from the search engines. the study also made use of the prisma flow chart to give a visual presentation of how the studies were selected for the review. according to faggion et al. (2014), a prisma flow chart is a presentation of the flow of information at the different stages of a systematic review that maps out the number of studies that were included in the review, the number of studies excluded and why they were excluded. the flow chart is in four stages which include, the identification stage, screening stage, eligibility stage, and inclusion stage. table 1. inclusion

and conclusions made. data analysis the data obtained for the review was analysed using thematic analysis (patel & patel, 2019). the study adopted a thematic analysis because it helped the researcher divide data into different data sets to prevent distractions that are associated with large data sets. in analysing the data, the data were first coded after which the themes were identified. the themes identified were then grouped into two namely major themes and sub-themes. these themes were presented under specific objectives. the themes were further elaborated on, supporting them with direct quotes from the studies reviewed. results this section presents the results obtained from the data analysed which are presented under themes. the results are presented in the form of major themes and minor themes. the results are first presented in tables after which they are elaborated on and supported with direct quotes from the studies. the results are also presented under the specific objectives of the study. the variables/factors that influence patient satisfaction in healthcare in this section, the first objective which is the factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare is presented. the major and minor themes identified are presented in table 4. a. institution-related factors the study found that patient satisfaction is based on factors that are related to the institution. these factors determine how the hospital delivers its services to the patients which in the long run affects their level of satisfaction. this result is supported by quotes from the studies reviewed is: “patients attending the private facilities had the highest level of satisfaction (i.e. 73%) and patients attending the primary care facilities had the lowest level of satisfaction (i.e. 52%). being satisfied with facility cleanliness (multivariable or 4.30; 95% ci: 3.29-5.62) and privacy settings (multivariable or 1.68; 95% ci: 1.28-2.21) were the strongest predictors of patients’ satisfaction” (adhikary et al., 2018); 218 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ table 3. selected studies date author title journal name objective

service quality and determine in-patient satisfaction with care at the university of benin teaching hospital (ubth), benin city, nigeria. cross-sectional survey the study found that economic constraints, staffpatient relationship, occupation, income, spousal role, health education and cultural beliefs influences their use and satisfaction with the health care provided. the study concludes that it is important for health care professionals to consider economic issues and cultural beliefs of recipients who seek health care in the hospital. 2021 caballo, prabhu, seal & chu the effects of socioeconomic status on the quality and accessibility of healthcare services across the spectrum of socio-economics to examine race and income as socioeconomic factors influencing the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. quantitative research approach the study revealed that ses factors had significant correlations with healthcare quality and accessibility. the study concluded people with a lower ses experienced lower quality of medical care and faced more difficulties in accessibility than their counterparts with higher ses. table 3. continued 221 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ the study further revealed that the institution-related factors are hospital setting, doctor-patient communication, and the attitude of staff and administration. these factors were identified as minor themes and are supported by direct quotes from the studies reviewed below: i. hospital setting from the studies, facility cleanliness, privacy setting, and availability of services like laboratory and diagnostic care, preventive healthcare, and prenatal care were factors that influenced patient satisfaction. “factors like convenient opening hours, asking related questions to the providers, facility cleanliness and privacy settings were significantly associated with patients’ satisfaction.” (adhikary et al., 2018). ii. doctor-patient communication the study found that good doctor-patient communication increases patient satisfaction whereas poor doctor-patient communication decreases patient satisfaction. “it is suggested that a significant communication gap exists in the doctor-patient setting” (hussain et al., 2019). iii. attitude of staff from the study, it was found that the attitude of staff had a significant effect on patient satisfaction thus being mentioned as one of the factors affecting patient satisfaction. “the study suggests that the physician’s behaviour significantly moderates the effect of health care services on the satisfaction of patients” (manzoor et al., 2019). iv. administration the study also revealed that administration procedures such as waiting time, convenient opening time, and reimbursement of medical bills were factors that influenced patients’ level of satisfaction in healthcare. table 4. major and minor theme for objective 1 objective major theme minor theme the factors that influence

in healthcare ﻿ “the study has revealed that factors which affect patient satisfaction are affordability, convenience, registration and administrative procedures and infrastructure and amenities” (kamra et al., 2015). how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare this section presents the themes identified under the second objective which is how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare. the major and minor themes identified are presented in table 5. a. positive effect on patient behaviour the study found that quality dimension has an effect on patient behaviour and the effect was found to be positive. this result is supported by some a quotes from the study reviewed below: “results show that there is an impact of perceived health care service quality on overall patient satisfaction. reliability had the most influence, followed by empathy and assurance” (al-damen, 2017). the study further revealed that the effect of the quality dimension in patient satisfaction is evident in the actions or behaviours of the patients. these behaviours are identified as minor themes. i. repurchase intention of patients the study found that when patients are satisfied with the services they receive, it influences their repurchase intentions. in other words, patients are willing to engage in future services by the health care facilities. this result is supported by some quotes like: “satisfaction significantly influences repurchase intentions” (al-damen, 2017); “the study incited that patients’ satisfaction and loyalty are influenced by the quality of medical/hospital services through its five components: reliability, assurance, tangibility, empathy and responsiveness” (bentum-micah et al., 2020). table 5. major and minor theme

increase trust and confidence 223 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ ii. word-of-mouth (wom) the study also found that when patients are satisfied, it is easy for them to recommend the services of the healthcare centre to family and friends. this is supported by some quotes which includes: “the results of this show that any hospital providing good service to their patients then will be satisfied and recommend their friends and neighbours for treatment to this hospital” (al, 2017); “empathy and assurance dimensions are positively related to customer satisfaction. however, customer satisfaction has a significant effect on wom and ri which are found highly related” (kitapci et al., 2014). iii. an increase in trust and confidence of patients the study found that when patients are satisfied with the service they receive, it increases their trust and confidence in the healthcare system and personnel. this is supported by the quote that states that: “from the results, it can be concluded that patients perceive the hospital workers to acquire knowledge, and skills as well as their ability to inspire trust and confidence. patients are assured that they are getting the best healthcare services from best doctors and nurses” (al-damen, 2017). the relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery this section presents the themes identified under the third objective which is the relationship between socio-economic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. the major and minor themes identified are presented in table 6. the study found that a positive relationship is seen in the care experience of patients, the perception of patients and the quality of service. these results are identified as minor themes. a. positive relationship the study found that there is a positive relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. table 6. major and minor theme for objective 3 objective major theme minor theme the relationship between socio-economic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery a. positive relationship i. influences care experiences of patients ii. influence on patients perception of healthcare iii. influence on the quality of service 224 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ this result is supported with quotes from studies like: “social and economic factors can support or constrain healthful behaviours. for example, people with social or economic disadvantage may not be able to easily eat a healthful diet, or provide this to their families, if they live in a neighbourhood where such food is not easily available or affordable” (swain, 2016); “our findings support that there is a strong positive association between patient satisfaction level and healthcare provision indicators, such as nurses and physicians per 100,000 habitants, public health expenditures and age” (xesfingi & vozikis, 2016). i. influences care experiences of patients according to some of the studies reviewed, patients’ care experiences can be positive or negative based on their level of socio-economic factors. this is supported by some quotes from the studies which includes: “the mean rating of patient experience for the quality of care for ambulatory healthcare services (outpatients’ care) was 74.31 ± 0.32%. moderate differences were observed between the hospitals assessed for various levels of patients care, especially for waiting time, quality of doctors’ care, and overall quality of care. employment status was a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) determinant of overall patient experience rating for the quality of care” (aloh et al., 2020). ii. influence on patient’s perception of healthcare the study found that patients’ perceptions about quality healthcare service are influenced by their socioeconomic factors. this is supported by some quotes from the studies reviewed which include: “most subjects perceived that their ses affected their health care. common themes included treatment provided, access to care, and patient-provider interaction” (arpey et al., 2017). iii. influence on the quality of service according to the studies, the socio-economic state of a patient determines the kind of quality of health care service they receive: “social or economic disadvantage also affects the ability to access clinical care, as well as the quality of care received. work hours, work sick-leave policies, clinic hours, and transportation and childcare issues can make seeing a health care professional very difficult” (swain, 2016). discussion this section presents a discussion of the results obtained from the analysis. 225 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ the variables/factors that influence patient satisfaction in healthcare the study revealed that the factors that influenced patient satisfaction in healthcare were institutional factors which included hospital setting, doctor-patient communication, and the attitude of staff and administration. the results imply that patient satisfaction in healthcare is a result of hospital settings like cleanliness and privacy. in other words, when a hospital is clean and respects the privacy of patients, the patients are more likely to be happy with the service which will translate to satisfaction. consequently, having effective doctor-patient communication makes patients comfortable and this also leads to patient satisfaction. likewise, the attitude of staff leads to patient satisfaction as a positive attitude of staff encourages patients to want to come back to the health facility as compared to the poor attitude of staff which discourages patients. the existence of effective administration and easy flow of procedures like less waiting time encourages patients to seek healthcare services on time. these results explain why patient satisfaction has become a crucial concern for understanding the needs and expectations of patients concerning services being offered at health facilities. how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare the study found that quality dimensions had a positive effect on patient satisfaction in healthcare. thus, because patients were satisfied with the quality dimension, there was repurchase intention, patients engaged in word-of-mouth and there was an increase in trust and confidence among patients. in other words, quality dimension like responsiveness, reliability, assurance, empathy, and tangibles affects patient satisfaction in healthcare. for instance, how a healthcare facility administration responds quickly to concerns and feedback from patients determines if the patient will return for future services or not. also, having a clean and well-structured hospital where patients can easily access wards and departments encourages patients to come back for services. by implementing some of these quality dimensions, patients are willing to repurchase services, recommend services to family and friends and also trust the medical team. the relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery the study found that there is a positive relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. the positive relationship was associated with the influence socio-economic factors had on the perception of patients, influences on the quality of service, and influences on care experiences of patients. according to watiki (2014), service quality is characterised by availability, accuracy, timeliness, responsiveness, confidentiality, amenities, and facilities among others. thus, the results from the current study imply that patients with high socio-economic factors like education, occupation, and income are more likely to have or experience high service quality in healthcare delivery whereas patients with low socio-economic factors have or experience low service quality in healthcare delivery. additionally, having high socio-economic factors influences one’s perception of service quality in healthcare delivery. these results are in line with results from some studies which include aloh et al. (2020) who found that the employment status of the patient influenced their perception of quality healthcare delivery. furthermore, education was found to influence patients’ perception of the healthcare provided. suggesting a positive relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. 226 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ arpey et al. (2017) also found that patients with low socioeconomic status such as education and income have poor perceptions regarding the quality of service offered whilst patients with high socioeconomic status have high perceptions regarding the delivery of healthcare service. these results suggest that there is a positive relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. conclusion this study aimed to understand the measures of person-centred healthcare quality variables and how they affect patient satisfaction and responsiveness. therefore, the study developed three specific objectives which included examining the variables/factors that have been indicated by literature to influence patient satisfaction in healthcare, determining how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare, and determining the relationship between socio-economic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. to address these objectives, the study adopted a systematic literature approach as the study design and a qualitative research approach in data collection and analysis. the study made use of only secondary data from related studies found in journals, books, and online articles. the studies were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the prisma flow chart. in all, 20 related studies were included in the review and presented in a table under the specific objectives. to analyse the data obtained from the studies reviewed, the study made use of thematic analysis. based on the thematic analysis, themes were identified and categorised as major and minor themes which were presented under the specific objectives. the themes were further elaborated on, supporting them with direct quotes from the studies reviewed. the findings obtained from the review are presented as: the variables/factors that have been indicated by literature to influence patient satisfaction in healthcare the study found that institutional factors which included hospital setting, doctor-patient communication, and the attitude of staff and administration were the factors that influenced patient satisfaction in healthcare. how quality dimensions affect patient satisfaction in healthcare the study revealed that quality dimensions had a positive effect on patient satisfaction in healthcare as patients had repurchase intention, patients engaged in talking about the healthcare service and there was an increase in trust and confidence among patients. the relationship between socio-economic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery the study revealed that there was a positive relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. this is because there was an influence of socio-economic factors on the perception of patients, on the quality of service, and the care experiences of patients. 227 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ the following conclusions are made based on the findings, the study concludes that there are institutional factors that influence patient satisfaction in healthcare. the institutional factors include administration, doctor-patient communication, and the attitude of staff and hospital settings like privacy, convenience and cleanliness. also, quality dimensions like responsiveness, reliability, assurance, tangibles, and empathy have a positive effect on patient satisfaction in healthcare. this is because when patients are satisfied with the quality of healthcare service they receive, they have repurchase intention, have trust and confidence in the hospital systems, and also recommend the services to family and friends. finally, the study concludes that there is a positive relationship between socioeconomic factors and service quality in healthcare delivery. this is because socioeconomic factors of patients influence their perception, care experiences, and the quality of service they receive. the following recommendations are given based on the findings obtained from the study recommendations recommendations for practice i. the study revealed that socioeconomic factors have a positive effect on service quality in healthcare delivery. it is therefore recommended that the management of hospitals consider socioeconomic factors like age, cultural beliefs, level of education, income, and occupation of patients when delivering services. by considering socioeconomic factors, health personnel will have a better understanding of patients and treat them based on their specific needs than providing general services. by providing services based on specific needs, patients will be pleased with the service they receive and this will affect their level of satisfaction. ii. the study also found that quality dimensions had a positive effect on patient satisfaction in healthcare. therefore, it is recommended that suggestions from patients should be solicited to provide practical ideas for the effective delivery of quality services that meet the specifications of patients. in other words, taking feedback from patients should be promoted in the hospital to guide management on how to provide quality services for patients irrespective of their socioeconomic status. recommendations for future studies i. the use of only secondary data had limitations such as the dimensions of quality service in healthcare, which could not be fully explored. this is because not all the studies reviewed explored all the dimensions of quality service. based on this, the study recommends that future studies should make use of primary data by adopting qualitative or quantitative research approaches in data collection and analysis. with these approaches, the researcher can explore all the dimensions of quality service in healthcare. ii. also, by using a systematic literature review, the study had limitations such as not fully exploring all domains of patient care or addressing specific areas of patient care. thus, the results cannot be generalised. based on this, the study recommends that future studies should consider either qualitative or quantitative approaches as by collecting primary data, the study can focus on all domains or specific areas of patient care. this will make it easier for the generalisation of results. 228 factors influencing patient satisfaction in healthcare ﻿ iii. the studies reviewed were carried out before the covid-19 pandemic thus they did not include the effect of the crisis on hospitals’ ability to provide quality service. therefore, it is recommended that future studies should explore the role of covid-19 on service quality and how it affects patient satisfaction. references adhikary, g., shawon, m. s. r.,

(2012), presented a step towards to a creation of a cloud of sensors and actuators (devices and/or cloud can perform actions), by introducing an architectural scheme that responded to the challenges using smart devices, sensing and actuation as-a-service (saaas). the portuguese health ministry created a health portal on which all public medical and health technical staff can access patient’s data, exams, reports, and analysis performed inside the nacional health system (nhs) institutions, so that when someone is attended anywhere in the country, all health professionals can access the data registered, diminishing costs, being more effective and productive. this platform is essential for patients and medical staff to visualize patient’s medical data, but only the ones registered on public nhs institutions, there is no connection to private health institutions. nowadays, the aging of population and growing life expectation is a serious concern to all national health systems, not only to create health conditions in the health system but to provide care to elder people. in portugal, the aging index grow from 27.5% in 1961 to 182.7% in 2021 (pordata, 2022), being essential to create conditions to promote health and wellbeing, increasing functional capacity, autonomy, and life quality to people while they are aging. many studies have been addressing the connection of sensors and technology to the aging, such as remote health monitoring, fall detection and elder surveillance. this study intends to propose the design of a preliminary framework model which allows the connection between all things that can remote monitor, detect and actuate in elder’s health, retrieving and integrating data into the health portal system to be available to all medical and technical staff anywhere in portugal. the proposed framework model is suitable for iot saaas business models, supporting multi-sensing client applications and multi-sensor supplier’s deployment, thing’s mashups, and multiple domains integration. the remainder of this article is organized as follows. in section cloud-based sensing and actuation as-a-service the main system architectures and functionalities are discussed. section related work discusses the work done on the connection between sensor systems and elders health. section framework model presents the design of the framework model proposed to interconnect all things into the portuguese health portal and section conclusion, concludes the article. cloud-based sensing and actuation as-a-service cloud computing objectives is to provide on-demand computing and storage resources to users, using virtualization techniques and proving an as-a-service business model. 233 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ se-aas was introduced by sheng et al. (2013) and aimed to provide sensing services on cloud environment, using mobile phones, describing system functionalities and tasks to implement the system. the functionalities described by the authors for a se-aas sensor cloud were: • web interface: it should have a web interface to collect requests from users. • generating sensing tasks: the cloud should perform generic sensing tasks containing the request information in a standard format. • tracking mobile phones: the data should be shared to all smart phones, so the sensor location and energy status should be available and have a way to push the tasks into the mobile phones for data collection. • recruiting mobile phones: sharing the mobile sensors of the smart phone was the main idea, therefore a way or mechanism to recruit and incentive mobile phone users to share their sensors must be implemented. • scheduling of sensing activities: there must exist an algorithm or policy to schedule sensing activities on the recruited mobile phones, for data to be collected. • managing sensors: the sensors on the mobile phone must be managed to collect and store data into the cloud. • processing and storing data: a database is required to store the collected data from the mobile phones sensors and to be able to deliver reports to the users. the authors, sheng et al. (2013) also introduced scheduling algorithms to address sensor energy issues to load sensor data into the smartphone platforms and an incentive system to attract users in participating in the project, being therefore, the first approach to se-aas business model. the se-aas model emerged from the processing and storage needs and has three main actors (distefano et al., 2012), sensor providers or node owners, cloud of things or sensing cloud and data consumers or software application. figure 1. those three main actors are also the three architectural infrastructural layers (perera et al., 2014) of the se-aas model: figure 1. se-aas generic environment 234 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ • sensor providers and physical sensors or things: this layer consists in sensors or actuated sensors owned by sensor providers that may register those devices in the se-aas cloud infrastructure to share sensor data. the providers must maintain, manage and control the things to be always available and being able to share the data they gather (kim et al., 2016). • cloud infrastructure or cloud of things: there are several types or servers on a cloud infrastructure to process, store and provide the services (figure 2): ◦◦ portal server: this server objective is to have a web interface that responds to user’s logins, sensor owners and data consumers. sensor owners can register or deregister their things and view the usage of their devices obtaining detailed reports. data consumers can subscribe sensor or sensor groups and access their data, controlling how many times data must be retrieved, check sensor or sensor groups status and the unsubscribed whenever the consumer desires. the server also forwards the consumers sensor subscriptions to the provisioning server for virtual machines creation, modification, or removal, depending on the action (kim et al., 2016). ◦◦ data storage server: this server main goal is to ensure data storage in the databases of the user’s information, the sensors or group of sensors or the gathered sensor data (kim et al 2016). ◦◦ monitoring and management server: is responsible for providing a solution that responds to multiple consumers (multi-tenant solution) on the cloud, be able to perform scaling and load-balancing between the created virtual machines to respond to consumers requests and available sensors or group of sensors. this server is also responsible for retrieving sensor’s data and check sensor’s health status, send the data to the data storage server to be stored and available for consumer usage. the monitoring and management server is the most important in the infrastructure since the provisioning is dynamic and based on live physical sensors, so it must have a location and status aware knowledge base for the provisioning server not to use the offline sensors while provisioning them to the consumer (kim et al., 2016). ◦◦ provisioning server: this server is responsible for the creation of virtual sensor groups (groups of sensors with the same functionality and similar properties) on-demand, depending on consumers requests registered on the portal server. the provisioning server will create and reserve virtual machines when receiving the request from the portal server. when the virtual machine is ready, the virtual sensor group is provisioned and stored on the data storage server, for the portal server be show the data retrieved to the consumer (kim et al., 2016). • consumers: the consumers through the web page available by the portal server will place their requests and start receiving real-time analytics from the sensor or virtual sensor groups. consumers can download the data or integrate through application programming interfaces (apis) to connect to their own applications (kim et al., 2016). 235 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ the workflow within this model starts with the register of things by the sensor owners using the portal server as the interface. those things are stored by the data storage server on the databases after a location and status check performed by the monitoring and management server. on the other side, the clients register themselves on the portal server and place their sensor data requests and the provisioning server will create the virtual sensor groups that better can respond to the consumers request, using the information registered on the data storage server where all sensors are stored on the databases. the monitoring and management server starts the data retrieval in real-time and stores the data on the data storage server databases. the results will be visualized by the consumers using the portal server. kim et al. (2016) describe the se-aas infrastructure functionalities, adapted from sheng, jian tang and xue (2013): figure 2. se-aas architecture figure 3. virtualization layers in se-aas 236 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ • virtualization: virtualization of sensors is used in the dynamic provisioning enabling device management and customization by consumers requests, where a single thing can be linked to one or to multiple consumers. virtual sensor groups can be created and provided for specific usage (figure 3). • dynamic provisioning: consumers can request a large set of devices on each request, due to the dynamic on-demand creation on provisioning of virtual sensors that respond to one or more requests and one or more consumers. the provisioned virtual sensors properties must be as close as possible to the consumers requests. • multi-tenancy: multi-tenant architectures respond to a set of consumers and permits the sharing of sensors or things and the retrieved data for consumers usage, providing dedicated instances for each sensor provider. se-aas in smart cities context is discussed by perera et al. (2014), addressing technological, economic and social perspectives. petrolo et al. (2017), propose also, in smart cities context, a global approach for sensor semantic annotation at the cloud for sensor aggregation and create a technological agnostic architecture to integrate and deploy things, ignoring their physical and logical architecture. their approach foresees the convergence of iot platforms and ecosystems needed for smart cities. hsu et al. (2014) and misra et al. (2014) address semantic selection. the first proposes a context-aware sensing service architecture applying selection and search options for user preferences, accuracy, energy consumption, sensing range, etc. the author proved that by the selection of requirements and parameters using semantics, decrease power consumptions in comparison with traditional search schemes. misra et al (2014), designed a framework for selection of the optimal gateway in a sensor cloud using semantics applied on remote health monitoring distributed on different geographic locations. multimedia se-aas was discussed by lai, chao et al. (2013), lai, wang et al. (2013), wang et al. (2017) and xu and mao (2013). the first work developed a real-time transcoding mechanism for http live streaming using cloud as basis and hand-held devices like mobile phones or tablets. xu y. and mao s. (2013) discuss the energy consumption, offload computing tasks, limited bandwidth, quality of experience, privacy and security technical challenges and how to minimize costs using rich media applications on mobile devices in a cloud computing environment. lai, wang et al. (2013), discuss an approach on network and device quality of service using cloud based mobile streaming. the main goal was to provide multimedia data using interactive mobile streaming services adjusting the transmission frequency interactively and multimedia transcoding dynamically to avoid power waste and low bandwidth issues. wang et al. (2017), presented a resource saving cloud-edge iot and fogs multimedia sensing as a service (msaas). the authors developed a framework for cloud edges and fogs that analyses frequency, data dependencies, temporal domains, and interaction in order to optimize resource allocation at the cloud-edge iot and fogs. se-aas model works on cloud for sensors data to be available for cloud client’s accesses, similarly to other aas models. resources must be registered by sensor owners and dynamically provisioned on client or data consumers demand, being as flexible and fast as possible to be afterwards available for other requests. the data consumers or cloud clients must register themselves through a subscription and the costs they have are directly indexed on the things and data they access and collect. the sensor owners must be incentivized to register their things and they will collect their return (amount of money) also 237 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ indexed to the accessed done on their sensors. this is the business model. challenges to design and plan such a system are: • the complexity of the system should be hidden, and services or applications must work without much overhead. • the data collection must be on a low cost-of-service per consumer and prepared to be scalable. • dynamic resource provisioning to client requests must be efficient. several models were developed to optimize resource allocation in se-aas, guerreiro et al. (2019), developed a model where embedded mashups (workflow wiring together a set of things) into the cloud to diminish delays of multiple travelling sessions between cloud and consumer and created a resource allocation heuristic with three different strategies to compare which one would outperform each other. the same authors (guerreiro et al. 2020), in another article, developed an adequate mathematical optimization model for resource allocation and a heuristic that outperformed the state-of-the-art method, being very close to the mathematical optimization model, fulfilling more consumer requests, using less devices with lower materialization costs, meaning that the allocated things are very near to the properties requested by the consumers. sensing and actuation as-a-service is a cloud computing business model, where sensor providers register their smart things to provide real-time data to consumers with scalability, security and redundancy, assuring multi-suppliers sensor providers and multi-consumers data retrieval, while the cloud infrastructure assures storage, processing, virtualization and security. related work many studies have been discussed throughout the years that support the interaction between sensor systems and elderly care. using time series clustering to detect elder daily routines, an algorithm to identify day-to-day activities deviations in patterns and generate alerts to healthcare providers was developed by hajihashemi et al. (2014). using time series sensors with a hierarchical cluster approach to extract periodic patterns in a retirement community in columbia mo, having a motion pressure and depth sensors network, the study aimed to quantify bathroom visits and verify the duration, the number of visits and the average time between visits. the computational algorithm developed by the authors successfully extracted routine bathroom visits of the elderly residents. using the hierarchical clustering approach, they detect the frequent sensor sequences with a high-rate average of 0.84, therefore supporting the robustness of the used method. an approach on surveillance with noncontact sensors framework was presented by wang (2017) to provide a temporal and spatial context on elder’s daily routines using passive infrared (pir) sensors. the conclusion of the authors study is that their system shows that using a single type of ambient sensors it is possible to detect and monitor the elder’s daily routines and routine changes. the proposed method is accepted by older people since it’s less intrusive due to the noncontact sensor’s usage. a hybrid fusion-based data sensor system to determining elder’s daily activity and routines is proposed by the same authors, wang et al. (2018). in this case, the authors propose a hybrid sensor-based human activity recognition (har) using a unique data fusion method combining wearable sensors, to identify 238 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ specific daily routines and ambient sensors for surveillance. the room-level location information is used in the data fusion to trigger the classification models trained by the wearable data. the development of a classification algorithm using vector machines allows the goal to explore and improve recognition accuracy. results demonstrate that the data fusion between the wearable and ambient sensors resulted in a improved accuracy compared with the scenario of recognizing all the activities only with wearable sensors. a preliminary study for remote healthcare system with activity classification for elder people using body sensors was presented by koçak et al. (2018) using radial basis function networks, k-nearest neighbor, and vector machines as the support basis of the study. the results showed that the best classification performance was 99.8%, but with the application of the feature selection, the performance decreased to 99.4%, nevertheless, with this study, it was possible to create a remote-controlled care system that reports elder people information to family or care takers when hazardous situations occur, such as falling or fainting and directly assigns a medical emergency unit to the corresponding address in such cases. casagrande et al. (2018) introduced a preliminary sensor event prediction system using recurrent neural networks with a long short-term memory in smart homes for elder people using binary sensors to predict the event in a sequence. the authors used in an apartment fifteen sensors, seven motion sensors in each area of the house and on the bed to determine if the elder is in the bed, four magnetic sensors on the doors and cutlery drawer and four power sensors on appliances, nightstand lam, coffee machine, tv and living room reading lamp. the sensors were connected using a wireless network into a raspberry pi 3 that receives the data and transfers it onto a secure server storage. a comparison was done with the results of the implemented system with the long short-term memory network to the baseline method from similar work previously done. the implemented system obtained a peak prediction accuracy of 69% and 75% for 13 and 5 sets of sensors, while the accuracy of the baseline was 58%. the results show that a much higher prediction accuracy is required before such algorithms are applicable. xu et al. (2013) discussed another important elderly issue, which is the elder falls. the authors proposed a body sensor network communication system with an acceleration sensor node placed on the elder’s head, a pulse sensor on the wrist, two plantar pressure sensors on the ankle and a sink node on the waist to collect real-time information and communicate with a remote computer through a bluetooth module. the system detected correctly if a fall event occurred, or a pulse change and the hardware implemented provided a good platform for the elder fall algorithm research. a fall characteristic monitoring system based on machine learning was proposed by hsieh et al. (2018), to support clinical professionals to assess fall events causes and create prevention strategies, consisting in a high accuracy fall event detection and fall direction identification algorithm. the authors used a tri-axial accelerometer to measure motion acceleration and a fall event detection algorithm that detected seven types of falls and six types of daily living activities (dla). the authors were able to predict falls with a precision of 98.67% and 97.57% for fall direction identification accuracy. a deep-learning based near-fall detection algorithm for fall risk monitoring classification system using a single inertial measurement unit was presented by choi et al. (2017) et al to categorize three classes, falls, near-falls and dla using accelerometers and gyroscope sensors to acquire acceleration and angular velocity signals. the neural network architecture proposed with a modified directed acyclic graph convolutional neural network which captured sensor’s data, was able to predict fall, near-fall and dla with 7% more accuracy than the traditional neural networks systems. in near-falls case, the results reached a total of 98% accuracy. the authors conclude their study adding that the deep-learning algo239 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ rithm developed, trained by combining acceleration and angular velocity, showed better performance then other algorithms in pre-impact fall detection. jiang (2022) addressed the construction of an intelligent system for elderly’s health and care in a physical medicine and smart sensors integration perspective in china urban communities. jiang (2022) proposed a combination of medical resources and elderly care resources, rehabilitation and social resources model integrating smart health and elderly care smart devices into a service platform software able to realize health management services, elderly care services and telemedicine services based on iot, to provide information support for china government to build a complete health services and guarantee elder’s health services and daily life remote monitoring. hong et al. (2008) presented a novel method to recognize elder’s activities of daily living with accelerometers and rfid sensor. the objective was the classification of five body states with a decision tree and the detection of rfid tagged objects hand motion information with a bluetooth based wireless triaxial accelerometers and igrabber rfid reader. their results show that the system can determine whether the elder can live normally or not with the reports being sent to the remote family. the development of cognitive sensors was addressed by gaddam et al. (2010) based on an intelligent wireless sensor network to monitor the living environment of the elderly people when living alone to provide a safe, sound and secure ecosystem at home. the objective was to deploy inexpensive smart and cognitive sensors for monitoring the activities of the appliances with features to include the coverage, small obstructiveness’s, that would be easy to deploy, uses reduced energy consumption, low on maintenance and more acceptable by the elderly community. the system used radio frequency with a controller and an interface control software that recognized the activities of daily living and lifestyle of the elders to capture abnormal behaviors. another approach on elder care was also presented by gaddam et al. (2011), with a home monitoring system based on a cognitive sensor network to detect electronic device usage, bed usage patterns, water flow and others, including a panic button. the main goal was to detect any abnormal pattern in elder daily activities around their houses. the system generated warning messages to the care giver whenever any abnormal behavior was detected. a fall prevention system was developed by sumi et al. (2019), introducing an accelerometer algorithm, bluetooth low energy (ble) modules in strategic locations and an alarm system to notify caretakers. the ble sensors detected and send warning to the server which triggered the alarm system, preventing the elderly fall. another approach on fall detection during the usage of a walking assistant robot was studied by wang and zhang (2015) on where the authors proposed a multi-sensor data fusion based on a neural network, making full use of tactile-slip sensor, acceleration sensor and gyroscope to acquire the needed data and falling risk. the multi-sensor data fusion system structure basic principle was using multi-sensor data complement, process information in time and space to achieve interpretation consistency of the observed environment. the fusion center based on neural network was designed to use the different motion sensors characteristics and measurements to realize data fusion. results show that the algorithm developed by the authors was better than using a single sensor for fall prediction and the system can recognize the fall tendency of the elders. an investigation on the performance of a wearable distributed deflection sensor in arterial pulse waveform measurement was presented by wang et al. (2017). the sensor was built on a flexible material with a polymer microstructure and an electrolyte-enabled resistive transducer array, that enabled the pressurization of the sensor by two fingers on the artery to register the radial and carotid pulse signals. 240 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ signal processing algorithms were developed to extract the key tonometry parameters and calculate the pulse wave velocity and radial and carotid augmentation index. the results show variations of gender, hypertension and the calculated radial and carotid pulse wave velocity has a positive correlation with age, gender and hypertension, making this sensor a potential and unexpensive point-of-care for untrained individuals to keep track of their cardiovascular condition. daher et al (2017) proposed an elder tracking and fall detection system using smart tiles. the usage of force sensors and three-axis accelerometers concealed under intelligent tiles was the authors strategy to detect and recognize human activities such as walking, standing, sitting, lying, down, falling and the transitions between those activities. the proposal was a fusion between the measurements acquired by the force sensors and the decisions done by the accelerometer, providing accuracy, precision and efficiency. the pressure sensors (load cells) measure the load forces exerted on the floor implemented under the tiles allow to determine the posture of the monitored elder, standing, walking, sitting, falling, etc. and the developed algorithm aligned with the accelerometer signals determines if the elder has fallen and may trigger a quick assistance. the results presented showed the flowchart of the fusion between accelerometers and force sensors to be able to locate and track the elders, recognize their activities and detect fall cases. another approach, on older people remote health monitoring, was presented by li et al. (2018) with the objective to study assisted living on two types of sensing technologies: wearable (accelerometers, gyroscope, and magnetometer) and radar sensors, using information fusion to enhance activity classification accuracy, vector machines and nearest neighbor support, to automatically monitor the elderly activity and fall detection. the feature fusion level implementation is described with the concatenated data extraction from the sensors before introducing it into the classifiers, improving, therefore, substantially the accuracy. the conclusions indicated that the classification performance was improved from 78-85% with individual sensors to 98% using multi-sensory approach and the proposed classification fusion method. inertial sensors to detect fall risk were used for the assessment and prediction in older adults in a study performed by montesinos et al (2018). the goal was to present a systematic review and meta-analysis in the sensor location relevance, the sensor task and their features, applying a statistical approach to identify their optimal combinations. results show a high and significant interaction between sensor’s placement, task and feature categories to access the risk of falling. the framework developed for future study, highlights dependences among those factors and the review demonstrated the optimal features from inertial sensors for fall risk assessment in older adults. singh et al. (2020) presented a review on sensor technologies for fall detection systems that aimed to provide a comprehensive technical insight in the previously done fall detection systems works, classifying the distinct approaches and the challenges encountered. the authors also had the goal to extend their study to provide an overview of each sensor technology such as accelerators, pressure sensors and radar camera-based and their fusion in a complete fall detection system, showing their strengths and limitations in terms of feature extraction, classification, performance and experimental datasets. the conclusions presented by the authors were the characterization of sensor technologies into acoustic, floor pressure, image, pir, near field imaging, radar, ultrasonic, smartphone-based and wearable sensors-based systems and summarized the strengths and weaknesses of each technology to help researchers in the selection of the sensor technology for distinct applications. mcmanus et al. (2022) developed a data-driven metrics for balance impairment and fall risk assessment in older adult’s study using inertial sensors technology. two studies were carried out by the authors, one 241 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ with an inertial-based balance sensor assessment and the other to report a reliability analysis of inertial sensor postural stability measures and validation, comparing them with clinical scales. the authors also elaborated a fall estimation algorithm based on inertial sensors captured data and a method to improve the fall risk estimate, incorporating standard clinical fall risk data. the authors conclude that their study demonstrates the reliability of the balance and fall risk measures acquired and their validation in a large older adult group compared with the clinical scales. the results show from the fall risk classifier models suggest they are more accurate at estimating fall risk status then a model based on berg balance scale or time up and go test model, concluding that the algorithms used in the authors study are potentially useful screening tools for balance impairments and falls risk. framework model as presented on the related work, many are the advances done using sensors and elderly health care, specially on fall detection, targeting physical medical parameters, triggering alert systems to care takers or family. jiang (2022) addressed the connection between smart sensors and the china government health management services to provide information and improve health care and better daily life to older people. this preliminary study intends to go further than that, integrating directly into the patients record the data retrieved from the sensors whatever they are, so the system must be agnostic to what features, characteristics or data sensors acquire. the objective is to integrate on a saaas cloud environment any type of sensors (things) and deploy the data directly to the portuguese national health system to be, in a short period of time, available for medical analysis or intervention. in portugal all portuguese people have a unique health process number, the personal patient data register, (ppdr) and a family process (fp) in each health center the family belongs to, so these two registers may be used to integrate the information gathered from sensors throughout the saaas cloud system into the portuguese national health system (pnhs) patient records. as mentioned before the se-aas or saaas model, sensor providers register their things into the cloud for consumers to be able to retrieve data from those sensors, after the cloud infrastructure dynamically provide virtual sensors corresponding as near as possible to what was requested. in this study the usage of the saaas framework must be altered for the system to provide dynamically the sensors, and attach the data retrieved from the sensors attributed to a specific elder, integrate into his specific health care registration process, changing therefore slightly the usage of the known architecture (figure 4). does this mean that the saaas model will not respond to health care sensors to integrate data into the national health record? absolutely not, for this to become a possible, there are some changes to be implemented in the usage of the saaas cloud infrastructure and new layers must be added into the pnhs patient records. 242 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ the first change is that the sensor owners are the same as the data consumers, meaning that the national health system will register the sensors into the cloud and retrieve their data, consuming all advantages this model have in processing, storing and effectiveness, responding to their needs in acquiring sensor data from elder patients without any initial investment on cloud infrastructures. there is no limitation regarding that a data consumer cannot be also a sensor provider, so that is a non-issue. another change here is to authenticate each sensor with his specific characteristics, functionalities and properties, adding the elder’s national health process number, for the cloud to be able to respond and integrate on the ppdr. to respond to this need, another parameter may be inserted on the request, which is the type of sensor, their functionalities, and the process number of the national health system as a property needed for that sensor. will this de-virtualize what the saaas model does, which is to create virtual sensors closer as possible according to the request needs? absolutely not, the saaas model permits sensor owners to register their things, and when they register, they must provide the sensor’s functionality and their properties (ex. functionality: surveillance video camera, properties: 40mpx, motion detection, etc.). once on the registration, one of the properties must be the elder’s health process number, so that when a request is made to address directly to that elder’s sensor data, will bind to the sensor with the same property. if that is guaranteed, the saaas model will respond creating the virtual sensors with the functionalities and properties inserted and there will be only the sensors directly related to the elders available, the one’s previously registered with that same exact property, so that is also a non-issue. what if the elders have a set of sensors all with the same functionalities and properties? as an example, force sensors scattered around the house to determine if a fall occurs. the saaas model responds to that problem again directly without any change. the system will create virtual sensors grouping in a cluster the physical sensors with the same functionalities and properties and will respond to the consumer’s request. another way to guarantee the data access to the group of sensors is to discriminate distinct properties in each sensor and in each request, but there is no need for that. so, this is also a non-issue. and if there is on the elder’s home more than one elder and uses the same sensors? here is the only problem that has no answer with the saaas model framework, the sensors will not differentiate which elder falls into the same home, it just knows it was a fall. in those cases, if there is more than one elder using the same sensors then the property inserted on the registration and request will have to be the figure 4. new saaas architecture usage 243 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ fp and not the ppdr. in both cases, and depending on what sensor data will be retrieved, the alarms must be on the ppdr side, due to the distinct physiology each patient or elder have and what are the parameters range, that will trigger an alarm for the clinical staff to initiate the help protocol defined. this will be also a non-issue. the flow will be as follows: 1. when the pnhs installs sensors to detect, determine elder’s health parameters, daily routines, fall detection or any other things intended for data retrieval, they must be register into the saass cloud infrastructure with the functionalities and properties of the sensor and adds a new property the ppdr or the fp, depending on if is a sensor regards one single elder or a group of elders. 2. the saaas cloud will register on the database the sensors with the functionalities and properties given. 3. on the consumer side the pnhs will request data specifying the same functionalities and properties that were register on the sensor, including the ppdr or the fp number. 4. the saaas cloud will search for the physical sensors that may respond to the needs expressed by the consumer side and will create virtual sensors with the same exact functionalities and properties given on the request. 5. the pnhs will acquire the specific data of the patient or family to be integrated on their databases. on the other hand, a new integration layer must be created on the ppdr side to interact with the saaas system, retrieve the information and store it into the ppdr databases passing through an alarm check environment (figure 5). the integration layer is responsible for requesting and acquiring the data from the saaas cloud infrastructure, verify the information, and secure data and communications. afterwards, the data follows to a second layer that verifies the parameters on the patient data record database and determines if there is an alarm to be triggered if the parameters read are outside the range of default parameters of that specific patient or if it will register the acquired data onto the ppdr database. figure 5. data integration layers into the national health care system 244 sensing and actuation as a service for health data integration ﻿ conclusion this preliminary study addresses the possibility to integrate sensor data gathered from elder’s sensors with the specifications of the saaas framework using the potential of the cloud infrastructures for storing and processing capabilities and registering data into the patients records. all features of the saaas were used to maintain possible the business model described on the paper, without changes, using the specifications the model provides, allowing health care systems to determine what sensors on elder’s homes or wearable sensors to respond to elders needs and gather and register data into the health care databases. this new framework design allows the registration of the sensors, the specific capabilities of a sensing cloud infrastructure, may register the gathered data into the portuguese nacional health patient record, for all clinical and technical health staff to follow the elder’s daily living and provide better care. the limitation of this work depends entirely on the portuguese national health patient record connection with the framework and with the saaas infrastructure. technologically everything is doable but depends entirely on if the national health authorities will allow the connection to the patients records. for future research, the author pretends to implement the framework connected to the portuguese national health patient record, perform a study on an elderly care unit and register the sensors gathered data for the clinical and technical health staff to access remotely and be able to provide better health care to the elders. references casagrande f., torresen j. & evi zouganeli (2018). sensor event prediction using recurrent neural network in smart homes for older adults (pp 662-668). 2018 international conference on intelligent systems (is). ieee access. choi, a., kim, t., yuhai, o., jeong, s., kim, k., kim, h., & mun, j. h.

abstract aging is a challenge for the whole of society and for all generations, involving issues related to intergenerational solidarity, but also to adapting to their new needs. the who has established guidelines for the care of the elderly. however, the realities and cultures of countries influence the provided care. it was in this sense that this chapter addresses: characterize the elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia; describe the elderly care contexts existing in portugal and in north macedonia; and reflect about the similarities and differences about elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia. despite the different realities, cultures, and policies of the two countries under study, the authors found that the elderly are cared for in different and distinct contexts, and there is a shortage of structural and human resources. introduction people aged 60 years and older are increasing in number and proportion. in 2019, the who (2022d) estimated people aged 60 years old and older were one billion. by 2030 it is expected that 1.4 billion people will be in this age group and by 2050 the number will reach 2.1 billion. although this is a phenomenon that may be happening in different varieties and at different speeds, it is almost universal. they reflect elderly care in portugal and north macedonia: different cultures, same goal carla piscarreta damásio

university st. kliment ohridski bitola, north macedonia 250 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ successes in health care and in social policy, but also this is due to a decline in the fertility rate and an increase in life expectancy, resulting in fewer births and more people living longer (greer et al., 2021). there is a need for societies to adapt to this changing demographic and invest in healthy aging (who, 2022d). to be an older adult differs considerably both across countries and within countries. health inequalities among older populations are the cumulative product of particular trajectories within social contexts that create social and economic advantages and disadvantages (greer et al., 2021). the 2015 world health organization (who) report on aging and health defines the goal of healthy aging as helping people in “developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being”. a longer life is an incredibly valuable resource. it provides an opportunity to rethink not only what aging can be, but how all our lives can unfold. however, the extent of the opportunities that arise from increased longevity will depend greatly on one key factor: health. most health problems faced by older people are associated with chronic conditions, mainly non-communicable diseases. many of these conditions can be prevented or managed through healthy behaviors and early detection. other health problems can be effectively controlled, especially if they are detected early enough. and even for people with decline in capacity, supportive environments can ensure that they live dignified lives with continued personal growth. the public spending on health systems, long-term care, and broader enabling environments are often portrayed as costs. however, as advocated by who (2015), these expenditures are considered as investments that enable the capacity and therefore the well-being of older people. these investments also help societies meet their obligations related to the fundamental rights of older people (who, 2015). with different locations, customs, and habits, portugal and north macedonia are looking to provide care for their elderly. society is becoming increasingly diverse in terms of behaviors, norms, beliefs, and values. each culture, shaped by its environment and social structure, has its own perception of health, disease, and care (lages, 2012/2013). it is in this sense, the importance to truly know the socio-cultural characteristics of the countries, to be able to better understand the provided care in each country. all countries, including portugal and north macedonia, need to ensure that their health and social systems are ready to make the most out of the demographic shift (who, 2022b, 2022c). based on these reflections, the following questions emerged: • which contexts of elderly care exist in portugal and in north macedonia? • what is the distribution of elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia? • what advancements have been made in recent years to enhance the national systems of elderly care in both portugal and north macedonia? in order to answer these questions, we opted for a narrative literature review. this chapter aims to: • characterize the elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia; • describe the existing elderly care contexts in portugal and in north macedonia; • reflect about the similarities and differences of elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia. 251 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ portugal and north macedonia: characteristics, customs and uses culture involves specific elements like ethnic, racial, religious, geographic, or social groups, which include personal identification, language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values and institutions (national institutes of health, 2021). assistance systems are an integral part of the overall cultural system. in every culture there are systems of assistance, formalized to varying degrees, whose nature is rooted in the symbolic heritage of the society (abreu, 2003). cultural factors influence beliefs about health, disease, healing, wellness and delivery of health services (national institutes of health, 2021). further we address, in relation to portugal and north macedonia: • location and history; • traditions; • demography and family structure and • relevant health indicators in aging and health care. location and some history portugal is a country located in southern europe (figure 1), covering a total area of 92,212 km2. it consists of a mainland region and two autonomous regions: the archipelagos of madeira and the azores, located in the atlantic ocean (república portuguesa, negócios estrangeiros, 2022). although king afonso henriques was recognized as the king by león and castile in 1143, portugal’s recognition as an independent kingdom dates back to 1179 with the release of the bull manifestis probatum. portugal, along with other iberian christian kingdoms, emerged during the regain period when christians who resisted islamic conquest began to reconquer lands they had lost decades or centuries earlier. portugal completed its reconquista in 1249-1250 by occupying the last islamic villages in the algarve. after some battles for independence, peace was signed in 1668, and portugal was internationally recognized as an independent kingdom of the hispanic monarchy. portugal was a country of navigators who marked history, with colonies in africa. in 1910, the monarchy was replaced by the implantation of the republic. after political instability, portugal experienced 48 years of dictatorship, which ended with the revolution of 1974, with no fatalities. the constitution of 1976 consolidated the country as a pluralistic and free republic, guaranteeing individual liberties and free elections. portugal joined the european economic community, side by side with spain, in 1986. portugal’s withdrawal from nato in 1949 came about due to pressure from the united states and great britain for a democratization process that lasted until the expansion of soviet communism, the priority being to maintain the fascist regimes in the iberian peninsula (ferreira & dias, 2016). the majority of the portuguese people are catholic, but the portuguese constitution guarantees religious freedom, allowing for the presence of several other religions in portugal (turismo de portugal, 2022b). north macedonia is a landlocked country situated in the center of the balkan peninsula (figure 1), occupying an area of 25,713 km2. the republic gained its independence from yugoslavia in 1991. the history of the region is very rich, its importance lies not in numbers or resources, but in the trade routes and communication between continents, regions and cities. most of the balkan peninsula was part of the ottoman empire, with the territory of today’s north macedonia being 5 centuries under ottoman rule, which brought diversity of ethnic groups, cultures and religions. ottoman control ended by 252 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ the balkan wars (1912-13) after which the region of macedonia was divided among greece, bulgaria, and serbia. following world war i, the serbian segment was incorporated into the kingdom of serbs, croats, and slovenes (renamed yugoslavia in 1929). after world war ii the serbian part of macedonia became a constituent republic within the federal people’s republic of yugoslavia (later socialist federal republic of yugoslavia). the collapse of yugoslavia led the republic of macedonia to declare its independence on september 17, 1991. in the 30 years of independence the country witnessed the yugoslavia wars, kosovo war and went through internal armed conflict in 2001. in february 2019, the prespa agreement came into effect, which ended the dispute with greece over the country’s name, and the name north macedonia was adopted. in the past 21 years north macedonia regained stability, organized a functional multiethnic society and went steadily on the path of euro-atlantic integration by becoming eu candidate member in 2005 and nato member in 2020. connected with the eu integration process, a political term western balkans has been coined, in the early 1990s, and since then the republic of north macedonia is considered part of the group of six balkan countries who remain outside the union. figure 1. map with location of portugal and the republic of north macedonia 253 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ traditions due to its history, portugal is a country rich in customs and traditions. from the north to the south of the country there is a wide variety of music, food, and traditions. some of them are among the unesco heritage sites, be they buildings, places or traditions. we highlight the mediterranean diet, which is part of the identity card of portuguese gastronomy. at its base we find vegetables, fruit, quality bread and unrefined cereals, dry and fresh legumes (beans, chickpeas, broad beans, etc.), nuts and oilseeds (walnuts, almonds, chestnuts, raisins, etc.), olive oil as the main source of fat and the consumption of fish. unesco considered it a true lifestyle, also highlighting the conviviality, celebration, and transmission of knowledge around the table (turismo de portugal, 2022a). the north macedonia nature, culture and cuisine are exquisite. the culture of north macedonia is a blend of ancient and modern influences. the country has a rich history dating back to the ancient macedonian kingdom and the byzantine and ottoman empires. this history is reflected in the country’s architecture, art, and traditional customs and festivals. folk music and dance are an important part of the culture, with influences from the balkans and the mediterranean. religion also plays a significant role in the culture, with the majority of the population being christians (59.4%) predominantly orthodox christians followed by muslims (32.2%). north macedonia has a rich religious heritage and is home to many historic monasteries and mosques (unesco 2022). additionally, the country is known for its delicious cuisine, which combines traditional dishes with mediterranean and balkan flavors. demography and family structure portugal has a resident population of 10 344 802, as of 2021. in 2020, the aging index was 167.0 (ine, 2022). however, portugal has become a country of migrations, with many portuguese nationals returning or repatriating and hundreds of thousands of foreigners coming to the country, adding diversity and complexity to the national demography. the inflow of immigrants has helped to reinforce the country’s younger age groups, including childbearing and working age groups, and to attenuate the aging of the portuguese population (oliveira, 2021). without immigration we would be fewer, poorer, and older (góis & marques, 2018). brazil, cape verde, nepal, guinea-bissau, india, angola, and pakistan are among the countries whose nationals have received the most residence visas in 2019 and 2020. however, besides these countries, among the foreign nationalities living in portugal, there are people from the united kingdom, romania, ukraine, italy, china and france (oliveira, 2021). portugal has stood out as one of the world’s oldest countries, and the relationship between aging and immigration is an important issue. research suggests that while immigration from outside the european union can mitigate demographic aging, immigration of eu citizens may exacerbate it. since the year 2000, the number of elderly people in portugal has surpassed the number of young people. the falling birth rate, increase in average life expectancy, and rise of emigration (especially between 2011 and 2014), with outflows of the fertile and working age population, have contributed to the effective decrease in the country’s population and worsened portuguese demographic aging (oliveira, 2021). projections by the national institute of statistics (ine, 2019) indicate that the country’s resident population will decline from the current 10.3 million to 7.9 million by 2080, with the number of residents falling below 10 million already in 2033 (figure 2). the demographic landscape of north macedonia has been deeply affected by the various upheavals the country has faced during its independent existence, as well as global trends. census data from 2002 254 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ (ssornm, 2002a) showed a total population of 2,022,547 inhabitants, while the newest 2021 census results reveal a population of 1,836,713 (ssornm, 2022f) - a clear indication of rapid population decline (as shown in figure 2). the changes in the age structure of the portuguese population, namely the decrease in the young population and the increase in the elderly population, result in the ongoing demographic aging process, with an increase in the median age of the resident population in portugal from 44.0 to 45.8 years between 2015 and 2020. in percentage terms, in 2020, the resident population in portugal was composed of 13.4% young people, 64.1% working-age people, and 22.4% elderly people. the proportion of elderly people in portugal was higher than in the eu27, being the 4th country with the highest percentage of elderly people, surpassed only by greece, finland and italy. in 2020, the old-age dependency ratio increased to 35 per 100 people of working age. in the 2018-2020 triennium, life expectancy at birth for the population residing in portugal was estimated at 81.06 years, with a trend of increasing longevity. in the same period, the average life expectancy at age 65 years for the total resident population in portugal was 19.69 years (ine, 2021a). in 2019, the mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants for individuals aged 30 to 70 years old attributed to circulatory system diseases, malignant tumors, diabetes mellitus, and chronic respiratory diseases was 288.5 (ine, 2021b) (figure 3). figure 2. population growth, percent in portugal and in north macedonia source: theglobaleconomy.com (2022) 255 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ the decrease of population in north macedonia is partly due to the decreased birth rate, but also due to massive emigration to more developed countries. emigration from north macedonia has been ongoing since the 1960’s, dominated by economic emigration, which in some families is transgenerational. the state lacks mechanisms to track the ‘old’ emigration nor their descendants (second and third generation). the massive migrant wave in 2015, and the eu countries response, brought major changes in the emigration from the republic of north macedonia. officially the state statistical office counts only 2104 macedonian citizens who emigrated in the period 2015-2019, dominantly younger people. more realistic estimation of the macedonian diaspora comes from united nations and world bank reports. namely macedonian citizens who reside in other countries worldwide increased from 527,075 in 2010 to 693,900 in 2020 (un, 2022). the preferred destination countries are australia, usa, germany, italy and switzerland. the return flow so far is minimal. between 2015-2020, the european countries of reception experienced a gradual aging of their migrant population from north macedonia, but the number of individuals in the working age range (15-64 years) continued to increase. in 2020, one-third (31.9%) of migrants were younger than 29 years, while the younger middle-aged population (30-39) constituted 27.1% and more than one-fifth (22.3%) were older middle-aged (40-49 years). out of the able-bodied population abroad, approximately 41,000 or 18.7% were over 50 years old, indicating an increasing number of macedonian citizens abroad who will acquire the right to a pension in the next decade. due to the long duration of emigration, the number of people over 65 years old is continuously increasing, from 12,059 in 2015 to 17,784 in 2020. during this period, the aging contingent (85+) doubled from 245 to 484 people (grnm, 2020). in contrast, the resident population in north macedonia over 65 years old is 315,331 inhabitants or 17.2%, and the average age in 2021 is 40.8 years. these indicators show that north macedonia is a country with an older population (ssornm, 2022c). the average life expectancy in north macedonia in the period 2019 to 2021 was 74.6 years, and the old-age dependency ratio was 45% of the workingage population in 2021. with an aging population and an increasing aging segment of the macedonian diaspora, there will be a growing demand for elderly care services in the coming decades. the government has started addressing this issue by increasing the number of available services for the elderly, but their effectiveness is still being evaluated. in terms of the percentage of the population over 65 years old, portugal and north macedonia show similar trends (figure 4) (theglobaleconomy.com, 2022). figure 3. age pyramid of portugal and north

undergone significant changes in recent decades. in portugal, the majority of the population resides near large urban centers, primarily along the coast. however, over time, the gap between urban and rural areas has widened, with the trend towards coastalization and population concentration near the capital becoming more pronounced in the last decade. roughly 20% of the country’s population lives in the seven most populated municipalities, which only occupy 1.1% of the total territory. conversely, the 208 least populated municipalities, which cover 65.8% of the country’s area, are home to approximately 20% of the population (ine, 2022). in north macedonia, the process of industrialization in urban centers and the lack of basic infrastructure in rural areas began in the 1960s, attracting young people to migrate to urban areas. as a result, according to the 2021 census, the population is predominantly concentrated in the capital city of skopje and other urban areas (62%), with many villages left empty (radulovic, 2017). the portuguese family structure has changed, with smaller families and increasing diversity. more people are having children outside of marriage, and there are now more single-parent and reconstituted families, which account for 27.4% of all households. the trend towards smaller family sizes is evident in the increasing number of one- and two-person households, and a decrease in three- and four-person households. in 2021, one-person households made up 24.8% of all households, while four-person households accounted for 14.7%, and households with five or more people accounted for 5.6%. analy- figure 5. dependent people as percent of the working age population, in portugal and in north macedonia source: theglobaleconomy.com (2022) 258 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ sis of single-person households shows that they are typically older, retired, and less educated, with a “significant growth” linked to demographic phenomena such as increased life expectancy. half of these households (50.3%) comprised people aged 65 or older, and while a significant portion of this population was already retired (48.9%), a high percentage (40.6%) were still working. women made up the majority of these households (61.4%). the average age at first marriage increased over time. from 26.9 years for men and 24.8 years for women in 1960, it rose to 31.1 years for men and 29.5 years for women; the data for 2021 point to 34.3 years for men and 32.9 years for women. the average age at birth of the first child has been steadily increasing, from 23.5 years in the 1980s to 29.2 years in 2011 and 30.9 years in 2021. the fertility rate has also been falling, reaching record lows by 2021. from over 90% in the sixties of the 20th century, in 2011 it reached 38.6%, and in 2021 it was 35.8% (ine, 2022). the average number of children, for women and men, went from 1.03 in 2013 to 0.86 in 2019 (table 1). changes in the family structure and functioning followed north macedonia’s urbanization. the macedonian family was dominantly patriarchal, the family unit used to be extended to 3 or even 4 generations living together in a household, where the oldest male member had the highest authority in the family’s decision-making process (radulovic, 2017). although the macedonian family still holds some patriarchal features, the emancipation of women, their significant contribution to the workforce and integration in the educational and political process led to many beneficial effects on the society. women stay longer in the education process, enter into marriage later on (27 years in 2021 compared to 23 in 1994) (ssornm, 2022d), give birth to their first child at a later age (around 28 years in 2021 compared to 23 in 1994) (ssornm, 2022e), have fewer children than before. the household shrank from average members of 5.02 in 1961; 3.85 members in 1994, 3.6 members in 2002 to 3.06 members in 2021. the total fertility rate is 1.46 children on average for a woman in the fertile period (15-49 years old) (ssornm, 2022c) (table 1). both in portugal and in north macedonia, the shifts in society have not only impacted family dynamics, but also significantly affected the need for external elderly care and the methods of providing it. table 1. some population indicators, in portugal

macedonia ﻿ relevant health indicators in aging peel, mcclure & bartlett (2005) identified behavioral determinants of healthy aging, such as: smoking status, physical activity level, body mass index, diet, alcohol use, and health practices. the latest national health survey conducted in portugal in 2019 reveals that 17.0% of the population living in portugal aged 15 or older were tobacco smokers (including heated tobacco); 1.3 million people (14.2%) smoked daily and 248,000 (2.8%) did so occasionally. males recorded a prevalence of smoking of 23.9%, females of 10.9%. the prevalence of daily consumption was 14.2%; 20.2% in men and 9.0% in women. there has been a reduction in tobacco consumption in all regions of the country (portugal, ministry of health, general direction of health, 2020). with regard to alcohol consumption, in 2016/17, 2.8% of the population aged 15-74 years old residing in portugal had high risk/harmful alcohol consumption and 0.8% had dependence symptoms. high-risk consumption or dependence are very close in the age groups from 35 years and older, with those aged 35-44 and 45-54 having the highest rates of high risk use, and those aged 55-64 and 65 years and those aged 55-64 and 65-74 years having the highest prevalence of dependence (sicad, 2018). however, according to the oecd (2021), the portuguese consume an average of 12 liters of alcohol annually, one of the highest records. excessive alcohol consumption will impact health and average life expectancy. in portugal the prevalence of hypertension in the population aged 15 years or older is 33% (gião, pereira & castelo branco, 2020). in 2018 the estimated prevalence of diabetes in the portuguese population aged between 20 and 79 years old (7.7 million individuals) was 13.6%, that is, more than 1 million portuguese in this age group have diabetes. the impact of aging of the portuguese population (20-79 years) was reflected in an increase of 1.9 percentage points (p.p.) in the prevalence rate of diabetes between 2009 and 2018, which corresponds to an increase of around 16.3% in the last 10 years (sociedade portuguesa de diabetologia, 2019). mortality in 2020 was mostly attributed to circulatory system diseases (28%), malignant tumors (23%), respiratory system diseases (9.1%), covid-19 (5.8%) and digestive system diseases (4.2%) (pordata, 2023). according to data from the world health organization (2022e), the prevalence of obesity in portugal, as in many countries around the world, has been steadily increasing in recent years. in 2016, the prevalence of obesity in adults was estimated to be around 21%, with the proportion of overweight adults being around 57,5%. this may have been aggravated by the restrictions imposed by the covid-19 pandemic that may have led to inadequate eating habits and physical activity patterns. (who, 2022e). for the general direction of health (dgs, 2023), in portugal, the main factors associated with obesity are: poor quality/unhealthy diet; increased sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity; lack of sleep or not having a restful sleep. referring to some health indicators of the elderly population, it is unfortunate that the official healthcare statistic is quite poor in north macedonia. according to world bank in north macedonia 35% of adults are smokers, 27% are heavy drinkers, 32% (2015) of the population age 18 and older has hypertension and 9% (2019) of the population ages 20-79 has type 1 or type 2 diabetes (world bank, 2020), that negatively affects the process of healthy aging. the mortality in 2021 was mostly attributed to circulatory diseases making up 35.9% of the total number of deaths, followed by deaths due to the covid-19 with 20.6%, neoplasms with 13.8%, while 5.8% were deaths due to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (ssornm, 2022c). obesity is a growing health concern in the republic of north macedonia, as it is in many countries around the world. according to data from the world health organization, the prevalence of obesity in north macedonia has been steadily increasing in recent years. in 2016, the prevalence of obesity in adults was estimated to be around 22.4%, with the proportion of 260 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ overweight adults being around 58.1% (who, 2022e). there are several factors that contribute to the high rates of obesity in north macedonia, including a diet high in processed foods and a lack of physical activity. the transition to a market economy in the 1990s led to increased availability of processed and fast food, which, with their high sugar content, contributed to the rise in obesity rates and related health complications. some of these health indicators are presented in a comparative table for the two countries under analysis (table 2). health care portugal has a healthcare system with high quality. it’s considered the 9th in europe and the 12th best in the world, in terms of overall efficiency. the portuguese health system is defined by three related systems. the nhs is universal, comprehensive and nearly free at the point of use, supported mainly through taxation. regardless of socioeconomic status, all residents can benefit equally from care. there are also health subsystems, which can be public or private covered by health insurance schemes. to speed up access to elective hospital treatment and ambulatory treatment, and to choose the provider there is the possibility of voluntary health insurance. at the central level, the ministry of health takes care of planning and regulation, while the management of the nhs occurs at the regional level, through five regional health administrations, whose autonomy over budget setting and spending is limited to primary care (who et al., 2017) (table 3). the healthcare system of north macedonia operates on a combination of public and private financing and delivery. the government provides funding for healthcare through general tax collection and healthcare insurance contributions, while healthcare services are delivered by both public and private providers. the public healthcare system includes hospitals, primary care clinics, and specialized clin- table 2. some health indicators, in portugal and in north macedonia country health indicator portugal north macedonia smokers 17% (2019) 35% (2015) high risk/harmful alcohol consumption 2,8% (2016/17) 27% (2015) arterial hypertension 33% (2020) 32% (2019) diabetes 13, 6% (2019) 9% (2019) mortality causes (2020) circulatory diseases -

that is, the oldest old - have indeed been left exposed (greer et al., 2021). the consideration of health and disability is crucial when discussing aging. if old age is associated with prolonged illness, disability and dependence, it has significant economic, social and health costs. the more educated the elderly people are, they have better odds for healthy aging. communities where people spend more years in poor health experience more negative health effects.

absence of disease, as the maintenance of functional ability is paramount for the elderly. it is important that health systems replace disease-centered curative models and invest in integrated care focused on the needs of older adults (who, 2015) the who (2015) defines healthy aging as the process of developing and maintaining functional capacity that allows well-being in old age. the goal of interventions to promote healthy aging is to maximize functional capacity1. this can be achieved by building and maintaining intrinsic capacity 2, which allows someone with decreased functional capacity to do things that are important to them. with distinct modes of intervention in each country, there are four priority areas of action to achieve this goal: 1) align health systems for the older populations they serve; 2) develop long-term care systems; 3) create supportive environments for older adults; 4) improve measurement, monitoring, and understanding. for each priority

interrelated, that aim to deliver synergistic effects on functional and intrinsic capacities: • module i: declines in intrinsic capacity, including mobility loss, malnutrition, visual impairment and hearing loss, cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms (table 5); • module ii: geriatric syndromes associated with care dependency, including urinary incontinence and risk of falls (table 6); • module iii: caregiver3 support: interventions to support caregiving and prevent caregiving strain (table 7) (who, 2017: vii). like any recommendation, its implementation is supposed to be

driver of health spending trends, and that even though there will be labor market changes related to population aging, older people continue productive (whether they are paid or unpaid) (greer et al., 2021). elderly care in portugal in portugal, elderly rights are not protected by a specific legal diploma. it is enshrined in the constitution of the portuguese republic (1976), in the civil code

active and healthy aging 2017-2025 (nsaha), in 2017 (rp, sns, 2017). based on who (2015) guidelines, the nsaha 2017-2025 is based on four strategic axes (health; participation; safety; measurement, monitoring and research). guidelines are presented for each axis (table 8). for each guideline, actions and the entities involved are defined, which go through different institutions from the different ministries involved. in portugal, the social security, with the help of private initiatives, provides various social responses to meet the needs of the elderly population. thus, besides the elderly person being cared for by a formal or informal caregiver at home, the social responses for the elderly are centered on home support service, conviviality center, day center, night center, family shelter for the elderly, residential structures, the vacation and leisure center (portuguese social security, 2021), and also the national network for integrated continued care (sns, 2021). there are many unpaid workers, particularly older adults, who are still productive, generating economic and social value. a generally invisible worker is the informal caregiver, which can be young adults caring for an older family member or older adults caring for either grandchildren or the ‘older old’. the social value of such unpaid work is considerable but not regularly quantified, and therefore in general goes unrecognized (greer et al., 2021). according to the 2020 study by the informal caregivers movement, it is estimated that there are close to 1.4 million informal caregivers in portugal (carrilho, 2020). similarly to the damásio’s research (2019, 2020), in which the sharing of experiences and information was crucial for the construction of the social network resulting from the mutual help emerging from the relationship established through the blog of people with cancer disease, also a group of caregivers and former caregivers who met on social networks, created the national association of informal caregivers, in portugal. technology-mediated communication allows new forms of interaction, in which people who are in similar situations create virtual communities that can then move on to face-to-face meetings (damásio & fontes, 2022). in 2016, a citizenship movement was launched to dignify informal caregivers, culminating in a petition for the creation of the statute of the informal caregiver at the first meeting of informal caregivers. the statute was officially approved in portugal in 2019 with the publication of law no. 100/2019 table 8. portugal’s

care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ on september 6. this statute provides a set of regulations for the rights and duties of the caregiver and the person being cared for, and establishes support measures for both parties. regulatory decree no. 1/2022 was later issued on january 10, which defined the terms and conditions for recognizing informal caregiver status and outlined support measures for both caregivers and those receiving care. according to this law, the person being cared for must: require permanent and dependent care from a third party; receive first or second degree dependency benefits or third person care allowance; have informed consent from the guardian or companion if applicable; have informed consent from the companion in the case of the accompanied major regime (law no. 49/2018, of august 14) if applicable; and may receive temporary housing in a social or health institution. the informal caregiver can be the spouse or unmarried partner, relative or kin up to the 4th degree of the line or the collateral line of the person being cared for (ex: children, grandchildren, greatgrandchildren, great-great-grandchildren, siblings parents, uncles, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents, great-uncles or cousins). the legal requirements to be an informal caregiver are centered on: having legal residence in portugal; being over 18 years old; having physical and psychological capacities; to be a husband/wife, partner or relative to the 4th degree; not to be a recepient of a disability pension. the informal caregiver has the following duties: to provide the necessary care; to provide food, personal hygiene and housing; to promote safety, comfort, tranquility and leisure; to communicate with health professionals; to ensure health treatments; to inform social security in case of any change to the informal caregiver status. informal caregivers have the advantages of benefiting from support measures; benefiting from “caregiver respite”; being helped by a network of professionals of reference; accessing self-help groups; getting specialized training and information; getting support in integrating into the labor market when caregiving ends. there are two types of caregivers: primary informal caregiver and informal non-primary caregiver. the informal primary caregiver is the caregiver who accompanies and cares for the person being cared for on a permanent basis, who lives in the same household as the person being cared for, and does not earn any remuneration from professional activity or for the care they provide to the person being cared for. the principal informal caregiver can be attributed, if eligible, with a subsidy according to the household income and access to voluntary social security. the informal non-primary caregiver is the person who provides regular care for someone, but not on a permanent basis. they may or may not receive remuneration for their caregiving services. the informal non-primary caregiver enjoys the advantage of being able to balance caregiving with employment; has access to telework for up to four years; can benefit from the student worker regime and supportive labor legislation. for each person receiving care, up to three informal non-primary caregivers can be recognized. the home support service is a social response that consists in providing care and services to families and/or people who are at home, in a situation of physical and/or psychological dependence and who cannot ensure, temporarily or permanently, the satisfaction of their basic needs and/or the performance of instrumental activities of daily living, nor have family support for this purpose (administrative rule no. 38/2013, january 30). this service is provided by institutions licensed by social security. the support is available every day and provides the following services: hygiene care and personal comfort, home cleaning, meal preparation and support while respecting medical dietary prescriptions, laundry services and socialization activities. additionally, it may also include training and awareness sessions for family members and informal caregivers on providing care to the user, psychosocial support, home cooking, transportation, personal grooming, minor repairs and changes at home, and occupational activities. 267 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ the conviviality center is a social response to support social, recreational, and cultural activities, organized and stimulated with the active participation of the elderly, residents of a given community. this social response aims to prevent loneliness and isolation; to encourage the participation and inclusion of the elderly in the local social life; to encourage interpersonal relationships and between generations and to contribute to delay or avoid as much as possible the internment in institutions (portuguese social security, 2021). the day center is a social response that provides a set of services that contribute to the maintenance in their social and family environment, of people aged 65 and over. its goals are: to ensure the provision of care and services appropriate to meet the needs and expectations of the user; to prevent situations of dependence and promote autonomy; to promote personal and intergenerational relationships; to encourage the permanence of the elderly in their usual environment; to contribute to delay or avoid as much as possible the internment in institutions; and to promote strategies for the development of the user’s self-esteem, autonomy, functionality, and personal and social independence (ibid., 2021). the night center is a social response that operates in equipment for nocturnal shelter, aimed at elderly people with autonomy who, during the day remain at home and who, by experiencing situations of loneliness, isolation and insecurity, need monitoring during the night. it is intended to accommodate people with autonomy during the night; to ensure the user’s well-being and safety; and to promote the permanence of the user in his/hers usual way of life (ibid., 2021; ordinance nr 96/2013, of march 4th). family shelter for the elderly is a social response that consists in integrating, temporarily or permanently, elderly people into families capable of providing them with a stable and safe environment. this social response aims to: welcome elderly people who are in a situation of dependence or loss of autonomy, live isolated and without social and family support and/or in a situation of insecurity; ensure that the person receives a social, family and affective environment conducive to the satisfaction of their needs and respect for their identity, personality and privacy; avoid or delay as much as possible the internment in institutions. no more than two people should be housed in each family (portuguese social security, 2021; decree-law nr 391/91, of october 10th). the residential structures are destined to collective lodging, of temporary or permanent use, for the elderly. with these it is intended to: provide permanent and adequate services to the biopsychosocial problems of the elderly; contribute to the stimulation of an active aging process; create conditions that allow the preservation and encouragement of intra-family relationships; enhance social integration (portuguese social security, 2021; ordinance nr 67/2012, of march 21st). the vacation and leisure center is a social response aimed at all age groups of the population and at the family as a whole to meet the leisure needs and break the routine, essential to the physical, psychological, and social balance of its users. it seeks to provide stays outside their routine of life; contacts with different communities and spaces; experiences in groups, as forms of social integration; promotion of the development of the spirit of mutual help; and fostering of the creative capacity and of the spirit of initiative (portuguese social security, 2021). due to the increasing demand for care from elderly people with functional limitations, patients with multiple chronic illnesses, and people in the end-of-life stage of incurable diseases, and the lack of adequate long-term and palliative care, the national network for integrated continued care (nnicc) was established in 2006. the nnicc operates under the auspices of the ministry of health and the ministry of labor and social solidarity. the nnicc is part of the national health service and the social security system and is made up of different types of units and teams, four inpatient units - convalescence units; medium term and 268 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ rehabilitation units; long duration and maintenance units; palliative care units, one outpatient unit - day care and autonomy promotion unit and one home care unit - integrated continuous care teams, excluding the network of pediatric and mental health institutions, and one outpatient unit - day and autonomy promotion unit (decree-law nr 101/2006, of june 6th) (figure 6). users can be proposed for nnicc responses in two ways: 1. if they are admitted to a national health service hospital; 2. if they are in the community (home, private hospital or other institutions or establishments) (decree-law nr 101/2006, of june 6th). the referral process is done on a specific computer platform (gestcare@cci) and involves articulation between the different teams involved in the process. in the case of the hospital, that includes the discharge management team and the nnicc local coordinating team (sns, 2021). at the end of 2019 there were 8867 inpatient places for dependent adults and the elderly at nnicc, of which 1078 were convalescence units, 2873 for medium term and rehabilitation units and 4916 for long duration and maintenance units. overall, since the beginning of the pilot experience in 2006, the number of inpatient places has been gradually increasing. each user can have more than one referral ticket. the main reasons for referral, with 90% and 89.5% respectively, were “dependence on activities of daily living ‘’ and “teaching user/informal caregiver”. in addition to these reasons, they include: rehabilitation (62.2%); post-surgical care (20.6%); wound/pressure ulcer treatment (15.4%); cardiovascular disease (14.5%); therapeutic regimen management (13%); caregiver respite (11.3%); figure 6. schematic representation of the nnicc constitution adapted from oliveira (2018: 9) 269 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ nasogastric tube/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy carriers (7.7%); multiple pressure ulcers (6%); and device maintenance (4.1%). the population aged 65+ at nnicc accounted for 84.4% of the total; aged 80+ accounted for 51.1% of the total. in 2019, a total of 50093 users were assisted in convalescence units, medium term and rehabilitation units and long duration and maintenance units (sns & acss, 2019). despite the increasing number of vacancies made available over the years, the care needs have also been growing. on december 31, 2021, 1310 users were waiting for a vacancy at the nnicc (1.6% more than at the end of 2020). the largest number of waiting users is concentrated in the long duration and maintenance units (ibid., 2019). the longest waiting time until identification of a vacancy, in 2021, was in the long duration and maintenance units, reaching about 54 days in the algarve health region. the number of inpatient days varies according to the unit’s typology. we highlight the long duration and maintenance units, which are the most sought after, with an average length of stay of 462 days, also in the algarve. the regions with the longest waiting time for identification of a vacancy are also those with the longest average length of stay (ers, 2022). the health regulatory authority (hra) conducted a study of the proximity of the population to the nnicc and found that practically all the residents in mainland portugal live 60 minutes or less from a nnicc facility. however, given the scarcity of supply, the greater or lesser proximity to a nnicc unit does not ensure access to this type of care, much less that the user is placed in the unit closest to his/ her residence (ibid., 2022). this can take the person being cared for away from the family at a time of special vulnerability, also increasing anxiety and sometimes some “guilt” to the family for not being able to care or visit. added to this is the increased financial burden that this distance can entail for visits. there have been several studies in portugal on the nnicc. oliveira (2018) analyzed these studies and highlighted that: • the referral and discharge of patients to the nnicc, in certain places in the country caused an increase in length of stay and associated hospital costs, compromising the objectives of creating the network (ferreira, 2012 cit. by oliveira, 2018); • there are primary health care teams that have difficulties in referring patients to the nnicc (bureaucratization, communication difficulties, lack of training, absence of inpatient units close to the user’s home) (fernandes, 2013 cti. by oliveira, 2018); • complexity in the use of the referral software (gestcare@cci) (sepúlveda, 2013 cit. by oliveira, 2018); • the decision on the patients’ destinations after hospital discharge has several criteria, including the characteristics of the dependent patient, the family, the community and the health services’ responses, with nursing criteria having the greatest relevance in the decision (petronilho, pereira, & silva, 2014); • in some parts of the country, the process of signaling and referral of patients to integrated continuous care teams has some constraints, such as little dissemination, unclear inclusion criteria, lack of training of professionals, lack of discharge planning, late signaling and referrals, delay in response time, and asymmetries between integrated continuous care teams (cunha, 2017, cited by oliveira, 2018). the work of oliveira (2018), fused on a portuguese region, also pointed out some constraints in the nnicc. at the procedural level, there are difficulties, especially in terms of professional resources in 270 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ the meeting of the user’s assessment team and in the application of the computer application (oliveira, brou & damásio, 2020). the researcher suggests the constitution of a specific team for referral. shortage of human and material resources was also identified. however, the general feedback from users and caregivers about this state initiative is mostly positive (oliveira, 2018; oliveira, damásio, & brou, 2020). elderly care in north macedonia in north macedonia elderly rights are protected by the constitution as well as by the law on social protection of elderly people (ogrnm, 2019). in the last decade the ministry of labor and social services established a legislature to support the creation of a network of social services directed towards elderly and also to stimulate private and civil society investment in such services. the aging population is in demand, as never before, for better access to nursing homes as well as to community services. the care of elderly is organized as residential long-term care and community social services that are delivered in a formal and informal way. the established regulations allow public, private body or civic society institutions to organize and operate a residential institution for social protection of elderly/geriatrics or services based in the community such as day-care centers and services for homecare and assistance for elderly. the healthcare sector also provides general and specialized services for elderly. health-care and social care are closely linked, however, the integration of health and social services for older people is on a minimal level (who, 2021). currently, there is a lack of communication among local health and social care service providers to enable timely referrals for older people to receive the appropriate level of care. while the coordination and continuity of care among healthcare providers is facilitated through a system of referrals and access to electronic health records using the “moj termin” (“my appointment”) platform, the country’s health and social care systems are relatively disjointed, with limited formal mechanisms for referral between them. this lack of integration results in older people’s needs not being effectively addressed. the primary healthcare (general/family medicine practitioners) system is one of the most functional reforms that was implemented in the republic of north macedonia healthcare system. the system is based on monthly payment per patient where the doctor receives a bigger amount for the care of children and elderly compared to younger adults. due to the high prevalence of chronic health issues, physical limitations caused by these health problems and the complex care required to effectively manage them, older people are likely to require more frequent access to both general practitioners (gps)/ family medicine doctors and specialists. in 2019, this type of healthcare appointment accounted for 22% of total gp/family medicine doctor visits. additionally, older people on average had almost twice as many gp/family medicine doctor consultations per person per year compared to those under 65 years old. the health insurance fund recognizes the complexity of the needs of older people and the crucial role of gps/family medicine doctors in addressing them. they have implemented a capitation payment mechanism that takes into account the age of the person, in order to provide an appropriate incentive for gps/family medicine doctors to work with older people. the upholding threat to the effectiveness of primary healthcare of gps/family medicine doctors network is the rise of the average age of the doctors, and uneven distribution in some regions, especially rural areas. geriatric medicine, hospice and palliative care is delivered by one geriatric institution based in skopje. the public health institution specialized hospital for geriatric and palliative medicine “13 271 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ noemvri” is the only specialized institution that provides health care in the field of geriatric and palliative medicine in the republic of north macedonia. it provides outpatient specialist consultations and inpatient health care provided through the geriatrics department (intensive care, acute and chronic illness departments). palliative care is currently only available at two hospices, located in skopje and bitola, with a total of 150 beds. these facilities are consistently at capacity and have a long waiting list. the hospital works intensively on the development and improvement of the treatment in the patient’s home as well as on the development of the day hospital. a significant part is the medical-gerontological education, which consists of continuous professional development, primarily in diagnostics, specificities in treatment, rehabilitation and prevention of diseases in old age, preservation of the functional abilities of the geriatric patient by encouraging a positive attitude of the old people to take care of own health. geriatric wards in general hospitals operate in a few general hospitals in regions with no available services of public nursing homes or hospice. these wards are able to deliver healthcare for geriatric patients long-term and the expenses are covered by health insurance fund and out-of-pocket money. however the capacity of geriatric wards is very limited. the community nursing service (patronage nurse) provides home visits to patients, mainly to offer advisory services for new mothers and newborns (more than 60% of the time), the elderly and individuals with chronic illnesses. however, the number of such visits is quite limited due to the major obstacles facing such services, such as the shortage of field vehicles and nursing staff. the home nursing service is only available in 36 out of 85 municipalities across the country. although the existing 36 community nursing services should provide home visits throughout the country, it is impossible to cover the entire area with the current resources. healthcare service provided in the home of the patient is a healthcare public service that operates closely with the emergency medicine unit. this service carries out home treatment in cases where hospital treatment is not necessary, such as immobile or poorly mobile patients, chronically ill patients whose condition deteriorates or complications arise, after complex surgeries that require dressing and wound care and for patients in the terminal phase of the disease. overall older people are not satisfied with the level of healthcare they receive, due to long waitinglists, difficulties with the accessibility of health-care services and the financial burden of the medication costs and other necessary out-of-pocket payments. the professionals in healthcare have their share of discontent too. the who study on the access to healthcare for older people in north macedonia, revealed that the significant burden of caring for older people among healthcare workers has had a negative impact on their motivation levels. additionally, there are inadequate mechanisms in place to support the well-being of healthcare workers, and insufficient incentives for patient- and family-centered practice, as well as limited opportunities for professional development and continuing education (who, 2021). the 18th principal statement of the european pillar of social rights states: “everyone has the right to affordable long-term care services of good quality, in particular home-care and community-based services” (european commission, 2021). affordable long-term care has become one of the 20th pillars of social rights in the eu, stressing its importance for the aging population all around the union. the research of tinios, valvis & georgiadis (2022) unraveled discrepancy between the countries systems for long-term care and difficulty to appropriately assess the effectiveness of the long-care models. the authors find especially interesting their finding that ‘greater expenditure does not seem to guarantee greater success in responding to needs’. the residential care being the most expensive long-term solution should be adequately balanced with the community services, both formal and informal. countries that utilize a combination of formal and informal care in their healthcare systems can benefit from the 272 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ strengths of both. these systems can effectively balance the needs of caregivers, care recipients, and the allocation of resources. the policies should support familial or informal caregivers and strive to optimize the relationship between formal and informal systems. the benefits of professional long-term care range from assistance with daily living, medical care, ensuring safety and supervision to increased socialization and providing peace of mind to the family members, all done with coordination and efficacy. the traditional macedonian cultural worldview is collectivist. in collectivist cultures, individuals tend to put the goals of the family before their own personal aspirations. older people from collectivist cultures are less likely to consider action that separates them from their family (eccv, 2015). the negative attitude towards leaving one’s own home and moving to a residential long-term care facility, is a strong mentality feature in macedonian elderly population. the older family members often have expectations from their children to help them during their aging and to be their caregivers in their own home or their children’s home. this model was efficient in the second half of the 20th century, but proved to be more and more difficult to uphold. the emigration of young families, the relocation of young people from rural to urban areas and the smaller size of the families have made this unrealistic outcome for many of the elderly. another reason why this model is not sustainable is the inability of children, especially women, to find enough time to take the caregiving role that is mostly expected out of them. without a well-built and fairly distributed network of social services for care of elderly, the long-term care system in north macedonia is strongly reliant on informal care. the role of family members as informal caregivers is especially evident in the rural areas and smaller towns. the state supports the informal caregiving by cash benefits for people with disabilities and their families and a care part-time work allowance, organized and financed by the central government. benefits in kind, which fall under the combined responsibility of the central and local governments, remain a more marginal aspect of the system as the result of limited infrastructure, particularly in rural areas (incare, 2022). the research results of the incare project indicate that there is strong agreement among respondents on the need for providing adequate financial and social support for informal caregivers. nearly 90% of respondents concurred that informal care work should be acknowledged as a formal occupation, rewarded with social insurance and a dependable income. additionally, a majority of respondents also believed that the government should provide financial assistance to informal caregivers who have to reduce their working hours or leave employment to provide care. despite the efforts of the government to decentralize and modernize the social care system for elderly, the informal caregivers and their role remains unrecognized. in 2019, the new law on social protection initiated a meaningful reform of the sector by providing a legal framework for establishment, operation and financing of various community-based services. four years later, there was a shift towards decentralization of care, increased involvement of the municipalities by planning, developing and financing of social services. in the last 5 years the situation is changing towards opening diverse community-based services for elderly in two forms: day-care centers and services for home care and assistance for elderly. according to the law on social protection, residential care for elderly citizens is regulated by the government. the elderly have the right to be placed in social protection institutions, which are under the jurisdiction of local self-government. there are currently four public homes for elderly in three cities: skopje, bitola, prilep and kumanovo, with a total accommodation capacity of 620 beds. the private sector of long-term care residential institutions for social protection is growing, reaching 39 private homes, predominantly located in the capital skopje. however, a very small percentage of the elderly population, less than 1%, are living in these facilities. this is lower than the recommended 3-5% of elderly 273 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ population living in residential facilities according to eu standards, indicating a need for more homes for the elderly. the costs of long-term care in the publicly owned residential institutions is covered by the taxes and out-of-pocket money. the privately owned residential homes are completely financed with out-of-pocket payments. the cost of the residential long-term care services and its affordability is the biggest barrier for elderly (incare, 2022), followed by the attitudes of older people regarding leaving their homes and availability of residential service in the nearby area. the services for homecare and assistance for elderly provide assistance and support in performing basic and instrumental activities of daily living for the user. basic activities of daily living include: maintaining personal hygiene, dressing, mobility within the home, help with feeding, using the toilet, and changing continence products. instrumental activities of daily living include: support with cleaning, assistance with small home repairs, shopping, cooking, purchasing groceries, mobility outside of the home, assistance with taking medicines, using the telephone, and assistance with budget management (ministry of labor and social policy, 2019). in 2017 services for home care and assistance were used only by a very small number of elderly people ranging from 0.3% of people with primary and secondary education, up to 0.9% elderly with higher education (red cross, 2017). after the implementation of the new social security law in 2019, the provision of this service has increased, however, capacity, accessibility, and availability are still inadequate. only a few civil society organizations are involved in providing services to elderly in north macedonia, particularly services related to home-based care and support. the majority of these services are operated by the red cross, 13 out of 20 licensed providers are red cross branches. this service is fully covered by the ministry of labor and social politics only for elderly who have functional inability to care for themselves and have no able adults in their household to care for them. the day-care centers for elderly can be established as centers for active aging, or a day-care center that provides care or some form of rehabilitation service. there are few licensed providers of service. day centers in certain towns mainly promote social interaction among active older adults and do not provide professional care. the union of retired persons is actively involved in promoting the well-being of older adults, including advocating for their health and social care needs. however, there is no formal involvement of community members or organizations in the delivery of health or social care services for older adults, and any community services provided are done so on an occasional or project basis. currently, care services may not always be fully equipped to create personalized care plans for older adults, taking into account their unique health and social care needs, goals, and preferences. however, efforts are being made to improve this and provide more tailored and person-centered support. although a lot was done in terms of reforms, legal framework, deinstitutionalization, decentralization, still the constatation made in 2011 also stands today, that for a good and durable implementation of the longterm care system it is necessary to promote the model of public-private partnership in cooperation with the non-governmental sector and the local self-government units (macedonian anti-poverty platform, 2011). in the matter of financial stability and sustainability of the system, it will be very important to seek new sources of funding for long-term services. public funds will always be limited by the gdp and never sufficient to cover all demands. therefore, there is an urgent need to seek opportunities to provide better financial construction for social services for elderly through private funds in the form of insurance for care. 274 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ portugal and north macedonia: similarities and differences in elderly care the systems of elderly care differ greatly among countries, reflecting variations in cultural values, economic resources, and political priorities. despite this, all countries strive to provide older adults with the necessary support and resources to maintain their health and well-being. portugal and north macedonia are no exception, as both countries’ systems of elderly care share the common goal of promoting the well-being of older adults by addressing their physical, emotional, and social needs. both countries deliver medical and non-medical/social care through both residential and community-based services. in addition to promoting independence and autonomy, both the systems of elderly care in portugal and north macedonia also strive to improve the interconnection between healthcare and social care for older adults. this can include having care providers work closely with older adults and their family members to develop and implement care plans that best address their needs and improve overall health and quality of life. furthermore, both countries aim to provide older adults with the tools and resources they need to maintain their independence, such as assistive devices and technology, as well as education and training to help them manage their own health and wellness. this ensures that older adults are able to live as independently as possible and improve their overall quality of life. portugal has made great progress in formalizing and improving connection between healthcare and social care for elderly through the establishment of the national network for integrated continued care in 2006. this unique system, adapted to portuguese circumstances, laid foundations for accessible, affordable and economic care for most of the population. one of the biggest challenges to the elderly care systems is the provision and effective distribution of financial resources. this is not an easy task, regarding the aging population and their growing needs. while both portugal and north macedonia aim to provide older adults with the support and resources they need to maintain their health and well-being, north macedonia faces several challenges in achieving this goal. one of the main challenges is the limited financial resources and lack of human resources in healthcare and social services. the number of trained professionals is lower in north macedonia, with fewer healthcare staff overall, as well as fewer trained caregivers for community services. additionally, the geriatric field is not perceived as attractive by healthcare staff, as they see it as demanding with limited career advancement opportunities. furthermore, the number of trained caregivers for community social services is small, due to the recent focus on training and community service development for the elderly, only in the last decade. this is additionally compounded by the large-scale emigration of young people from the country, which reduces the potential workforce, as well as leaves more older people with unmet needs for assistance. even though portugal’s population is one of the oldest in europe, the country is in a better position in terms of the workforce both in healthcare and social services. portugal started developing communitybased social services in the 20th century, leading to the current diversity of available services. this has helped to ensure that older adults have access to a wide range of support and resources to help them maintain their health and well-being. despite the diversity of services offered in portugal to the elderly population, it can be seen that they are insufficient to meet the needs of the population. furthermore, as in north macedonia, the careers for working with the elderly are not attractive. although there are already professionals with specific training, they are not valued in relation to those who have no training, which does not encourage people to invest in training. 275 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ north macedonia is in the process of developing a decentralized concept of elderly care, with the adoption of basic legislation that has led to the growth of new community-based services. in the last five years, the legislation has become operational, and some services have been established and are functional. this has allowed for the evaluation of the effects and functionality of the established services, the creation of a wider network of services that are more accessible to the population living in remote areas, and a deeper assessment of the contemporary needs of the elderly population. it also provides an opportunity for the development of additional services in the community, and the improvement of existing legislation to be more inclusive and functional. on the other hand, portugal has made an important breakthrough in social care by regulating the status of informal caregivers. north macedonia recognizes the importance of informal caregivers in elderly care, but currently lacks legislation that formally recognizes this status, or provides support beyond giving in-kind financial support to elderly in need of assistance and care. despite the recognition provided by law and the status of the informal caregiver already being regulated, the process of its attribution is complex and bureaucratic, which requires some digital literacy, which most caregivers do not have, leading to the majority not benefiting from it yet. both in portugal and in north macedonia systems of elderly care, the role of the government in financing and providing care is crucial. in north macedonia, the government provides funding for elderly care from general tax collection. in portugal, the working population contributes to social assistance. however, the investment in the social sector is not sufficient to meet the growing needs, resulting in elderly care largely being provided and/or paid for out of pocket. the private sector is rapidly developing in residential care, with little government support for new public facilities and limited investments to maintain existing infrastructure. the current financing of elderly social care is not adequate, so the north macedonia’s government may consider implementing a system of social insurance, where adults pay into the system through their working years. to cope with this situation, in portugal the retirement age has been increasing over the last twenty years, justified by the increase in average life expectancy. since the covid-19 pandemic, average life expectancy has fallen, so the government has lowered the retirement age by one year from the previous year. portugal finances elderly care through a combination of social security, pensions and taxes, which helps to ensure that elderly care is accessible to part of the population. despite policies, some resources, good care and promotion of active aging is much more accessible to those who are more literate and have greater financial facilities. both countries share some similarities in mentality and lifestyle, being southern european countries with strong cohesion in the family system. as a result, elderly people in both countries prefer to stay in their homes as long as possible and use home-based care and support services. in portugal, this is achievable for a large part of the elderly population, compared to north macedonia, where home-based services are still in the early stages of development. finally, it is important to note that the quality of elderly care also differs between portugal and north macedonia. it is reasonable to assume that the quality of elderly care is generally better in portugal than in north macedonia. this is not only because portugal invests more finances in social services, but also because it has a better network and more diverse community-based social services than north macedonia. additionally, the recognition of informal caregivers in portugal significantly improves the quality of life of the elderly and their family’s well-being. 276 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ conclusion the who has been advocating for health equity and governance, recognizing that social action and environmental factors play a significant role in overcoming health disparities (who, 2019a). with improved living conditions and healthcare, life expectancy has been increasing worldwide. according to the who’s 2019 estimates (who, 2019b), boys born that year will have an average life expectancy of 69.8 years, while girls will live an average of 74.2 years. however, despite women living longer than men, these additional years are not always spent in good health. the health status of a given area, whether it is a region or a country, is shaped by various factors such as demographics, health practices, and socioeconomic variables. the politics of aging, as noted by greer et al. (2021), is a politics of inequality, in which aging is no longer a uniform process. in recent years, there has been a global trend towards an aging population, with increasing average life expectancy, improved living conditions, and better healthcare. however, this trend has also led to a decrease in the percentage of young people in the total population, due to lower birth rates and emigration. portugal and north macedonia are among the countries facing the challenge of demographic aging, and despite improvements in healthcare, many older people still experience high levels of dependence on others for self-care, which affects their overall health and well-being. from this background the following questions emerged: • which contexts of elderly care exist in portugal and in north macedonia? • what is the distribution of elderly care in portugal and in north macedonia? • what advancements have been made in recent years to enhance the national systems of elderly care in both portugal and north macedonia? in order to answer these questions, we opted for a narrative literature review. after characterizing the who guidelines on aging, we examined the care of the elderly and described the care settings in portugal and north macedonia. in portugal, the rights of the elderly are not protected by specific legislation. however, relevant strategies and reforms have been developed by the ministries of health and social security. the national strategy for active and healthy aging 2017-2025, based on the who guidelines (who, 2015), was developed in response to a decision by the european parliament and the council in 2011. four strategic axes were defined: health, participation, safety, and measurement, monitoring and research. guidelines were also defined for each strategic axis, and for each guideline, actions and the entities involved were specified, involving various institutions from different ministries. social security, with the help of private initiatives, provides various social responses aimed at meeting the needs of the elderly population. these include home support service, conviviality center, day center, night center, family shelter for the elderly, residential structures, vacation and leisure center, and the national network for integrated continued care. among the various policies to support aging, we highlight the publication of the informal care statute in 2019, which sought to regulate the rights and duties of caregivers and those being cared for. the shortage of resources and the need for elderly care has led to an important response known as the national network for integrated continued care. this network was created in 2006 under the auspices of the ministries of health and labor and social security, and includes several units: inpatient units 277 elderly care in portugal and north macedonia ﻿ (convalescence units, medium-term and rehabilitation units, long durations and maintenance units, and palliative care units); outpatient units, and home care units. as far as north macedonia is concerned, the rights of the elderly are protected by the constitution and the law on social protection of elderly people. there has been an effort and an investment in the creation of social services directed towards elderly and also to stimulate private and civil society investment in such services. despite the efforts of the government to decentralize and modernize the social care system for elderly, the informal caregivers and their role remains unrecognized. there is some difficulty in communication between different health care providers and social care services, which translates into older people having difficulty receiving the level of care they need. older people can use primary health care, and while in cities the primary healthcare is accessible, some of the rural population is left out. geriatric medicine, hospice and palliative care are oriented towards medical treatment and geriatric education, mainly in diagnosis, specificities in treatment, rehabilitation and prevention of diseases in old age, preservation of functional abilities of the geriatric patient, encouraging a positive attitude of the elderly to take care of their own health, which meets the emanation of the who (2015). some general hospitals also have geriatric wards, which are able to deliver health-care for geriatric patients long-term. the community nursing service, available in 36 of the country’s 85 municipalities, offers visits to patients in their homes. the elderly can also be cared for in their home. this is a public care service that operates close to the emergency services, which provides care at home when hospital treatment is dispensable in situations of immobility, chronic illness with complications, after complex surgery or for patients in the terminal phase of the disease. elderly can also be cared for at day-care centers, at services for homecare and assistance for elderly and also at residential care for elderly. about the reflection on the similarities and differences in elderly care in portugal and north macedonia, it was concluded that both countries aim to provide older adults with the support and resources they need to maintain their health and well-being. however, the systems of elderly care vary, reflecting differences in cultural values, economic resources, and political priorities. while portugal has a strong and more flexible system of elderly care, north macedonia is still working on improving its system and providing better care for its elderly population. both in portugal and in north macedonia, the careers of professionals caring for the elderly are not valued, often due to lack of regulation, but also due to lack of training of these professionals. in this sense, it would be very pertinent to conduct a study on the analysis of training in gerontology in both countries. references abreu, w. c.

2015). this is an achievement, both for individuals and for societies, resulting from economic, social, and biomedical progress, proving to be essential to analyze the challenges that emerge and the adaptation needs of societies (cabral, ferreira, silva, jerónimo, & marques, 2013). in effect, aging contributes to the increase of acute and chronic diseases, with several chronic diseases coexisting in the elderly (pinto, 2021), including the need to accommodate physical changes, functional limitations, and other changes in psychological and social functioning, although there are individual differences in the onset, course, and extent of these changes (opp, 2022). the promotion of active and healthy aging along the life cycle has been mention as a response to the challenges associated with longevity and the aging of the population (pinto, 2021; who, 1999, 2002, 2012, 2015). the elderly population is highly diverse, and the aging process is quite heterogeneous. in this sense, simões (2006) refers that at no other age do differences assume such a significant expression as in the last stage of life. development at the end of life is simultaneously characterized by stability and change (baltes, 1997), with many older adults successfully adapting to changes and continuing to show personal and interpersonal development (hill, 2005). approaching the elderly implies considering their health condition, which constitutes one of the fundamental aspects of general well-being and, therefore, one of the aspects to be taken into account in any intervention, which aims for successful aging (paúl & fonseca, 2001). the world health organization defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease”. in this perspective, for successful active aging, the promotion of social relationships and mental health is equally important as the promotion of physical health (who, 1999). according to the ottawa charter “health promotion works through concrete and effective community action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning strategies and implementing them to achieve better health. at the heart of this process is the empowerment of communities - their ownership and control of their endeavors and destinies. (...) this requires full and continuous access to information, learning opportunities for health, as well as funding support” (who, 1986). 286 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ in this sense, the development of health literacy levels in the population proves to be strategic and fundamental, as a way of promoting health and optimizing the quality of life and well-being of the population. promoting health literacy has shown positive effects on the resilience of individuals and communities, reducing health inequalities and improving overall health and well-being (sns, 2017). active and healthy aging can be defined as the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation, and security to improve the quality of life during aging, as well as the process of developing and maintaining functional capacity, which contributes to the well-being of elderly, functional capacity being the result of the interaction of the person’s intrinsic capacities (physical and mental) with the environment (who, 2002). in these terms, quality of life is the fundamental aspect of active aging (cabral et al., 2013), defined as a broad concept that is affected in a complex way by physical health, psychological state, level of independence, person’s social relationships, and the relationship with the characteristics of the respective environment (who, 1997). some studies show that quality of life, well-being, and maintenance of mental qualities are related to social activity, socializing, and feelings integrated and valuable in the family and community (carvalho & dias, 2011). the perspective of active aging is based on the recognition of the rights and principles established by the united nations for the elderly, including independence, participation, dignity, care, and selfrealization (who, 2002). the aging population in portugal the phenomenon of demographic aging, recognized through reports and officially available statistical indicators, at an international and national level, constitutes a global, universal, and emerging reality in societies. portugal is one of the most aged countries in europe. in 2022, more than a fifth (21.1%) of the population of the european union was 65 years old or older, and it can be seen that in the total population, italy (23.8%), portugal (23.7%), finland (23.1%), greece (22.7%) and croatia (22.5%) had the highest percentages of elderly (eurostat, 2023). according to the definitive results of the xvi general population census (ine, 2022), abbreviated to census 2021, the resident population in portugal is 10 343 066 individuals, of which 4 920 220 (47.6%) are men and 5 422 846 (52.4%) are women. there was a decrease of 2.1% in the resident population compared to 2011, highlighting a reversal of its growth. thus, the age composition of a country refers to the proportional number of children, young people, adults, and elderly, and the aging of a population is related to a reduction in the number of children and young people and an increase in the proportion of people aged 60 years and over or more (who, 2022). in portugal, the elderly are when their age level reaches 65 years of age or more (sns, 2017). in 2021, the total resident population aged 65 and over is 2 423 639, an increase of 20.6% compared to 2011, which had 2 010 064 people. in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the population at younger ages to the detriment of an increase in the elderly population. in 2021, there was an increase in the aging index1 of 182 elderly per 100 young people, a value that in 2011 reached 128 per 100 young people (ine, 2022). on the other hand, in portugal, life expectancy at birth was 79.8 in 2011, having evolved to 80.7 in 2020. currently, life expectancy for men is 77.7 years, while for women it stands at 83.4 years (pordata, 2022), with the number of women higher than that of men, reflecting the higher levels of mortality in 287 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ the male population (ine, 2022). according to available data, life expectancy at age 65 in 2020 was 17.4% for men and 20.8% for women (pordata, 2022). portugal recorded, in 2021, a longevity index of 29.4%, which stood at 14.5% (1960). given the characteristics of the evolution of the longevity of the elderly population, there has been an increase in the elderly dependency index which, in 2021, rose to 36.1% compared to 2.6% recorded in 1960 (pordata, 2023). resident population projections between 2018 and 2080, estimate that portugal will lose population, the number of young people and births will decrease, with an increase in the number of elderly (65 and over), and the aging index will almost double, passing from 159 to 300 elderly for every 100 young people. in 2080, it will tend to stabilize by 2050, highlighting, however, an increasingly aging population (ine, 2020)2. violence against the elderly: an international and national reality the world health organization estimates that in 2021, 16% of the elderly will have been victims of abuse (who, 2022a), and one in six people aged 60 or over annually experience abuse in the community, with only 4% of cases having been reported (who, 2022b). europe and portugal have a higher prevalence of violence against the elderly of a psychological nature (10%; 6%) and financial (3% and 6%), followed by both physical (2%), sexual (1%), and negligence /1%), respectively (who, 2022a). according to the annual report of the portuguese association for victim support (apav, 2021), a reference institution in portugal that provides support to victims, the national results record a total of 1594 victims of the elderly. this report contains the phenomenon of violence against children and young people, in a total universe of 1959 victims, which in comparison with the elderly is very similar, which highlights the risk between both. the profile of the victim of elderly is female (70%), with an average age of 76 years, with a low education degree (5.8%) and higher education (2.9%). family relationships were significant, reflected in the relationship with the perpetrator of the crime, father or mother (26.2%), and spouse (16.5%). concerning the perpetrator of the crime, apav registered in 2021, the highest number of males (60.9%), maintaining the trend of previous years, which demonstrated that men are the main aggressors. in 2021, the number of elderly, over 65 years of age, who came to the knowledge of apav represented 4.2% of the records, maintaining the trend of recent years, given that in 2020, it represented 4, 8% and, in 2019, 4.5% of cases. relationships between perpetrator and victim of crime are generally guided by intimate relationships, conjugality (15.5%), and relationships between partners (8.5%), with family relationships of consanguinity, also showing significance, in cases where the victim is the child of the author of the crime (7.8%), followed by 6.4%, in which the victim is the father or mother of the author. in the characterization of victimization, the most referenced crime scene was the common residence (49.4%), between the victim and the perpetrator of the crime, followed by the victim’s residence (15.9%) (apav, 2021). in portugal, the national republican guard (gnr) created the first edition of the “senior census” operation, in 2011, with the principal objective, in terms of crime prevention, through georeferencing and surveying the number of elderly living in isolation and or in situations of isolation (ramos, 2020), 288 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ referring the situations of greater vulnerability to the competent authorities, with intervention in the social area, to monitor them. the gnr, signaled in 2022, 44 511 elderly, who live alone and or isolated, or in a vulnerable situation, due to their physical, psychological, or other condition that may jeopardize their safety. in the last decade, we have witnessed a growing trend of signaling the elderly expressed by data recorded since 2011, the year in which 15,596 elderly were registered. in portugal, the study carried out by the national institute of health doutor ricardo jorge (2014), on the prevalence of violence against the elderly, showed that 12.3% of the population over 60 years of age was the victim of at least one episode of violence over one year. statistics from the security forces found that the phenomenon of violence against the elderly has registered a significant increase in participation, which may reflect a greater awareness of society in the promotion and defense of the rights of the elderly, due to the increase in the aging of the population or by an increase in public services and institutions with intervention in the social area (ramalho & ramalho, 2014). in line with national statistics, globally, the results pointed to a prevalence of female and male victimization identical to that found internationally, which showed that the female population has a higher risk of abuse (dgs, 2016). some studies indicate that almost 90% of abusers are family members (wilber & mcneilly, 2001), including the other spouse and children. in this sense, it is noted that is difficult for victims not to denounce the aggressors, which is usually due to the existence of a family connection, fear of reprisals, and social stigma (oliveira, 2008), which leads to silence or withdrawal of the complaint, resulting in the archiving of the processes. legal framework for the protection of the elderly the legal framework in force in portugal about the protection of the elderly has been showing, in the last decade, through a set of guiding diplomas, a growing concern to avoid risky situations against the elderly. the constitution of the portuguese republic declares in articles 1 and 13 that portugal is a republic based on the dignity of the human person and committed to building a free, fair, and solidary society, ensuring that all citizens have the same social dignity and are equal before the law. following the provisions of articles 67 and 72, the constitution of the portuguese republic recognizes the family as a fundamental element of society, assigns to society and the state the duty to protect the family, in particular, concerning refers to “third age” which determines that “elderly have the right to economic security and housing conditions and family and community living that respect their autonomy and avoid and overcome isolation or social marginalization” taking into account to provide older people with opportunities for personal fulfillment through active participation in community life. in portugal, as in most european legal systems, the legal-criminal framework, the protection of the elderly does not have a specific regulatory framework. however, the legislator intended to safeguard and protect cases of vulnerability or abandonment, within the scope of the concept of “a person particularly helpless due to age”, embodied in several articles of the penal code (cp) and the provisions of decree- law n.º 48/95, of march 15 (branco, 2018; mendes & xavier, 2017), also recognized by the global status report on violence prevention (who, 2014). in article 67.º-a of law nº 130/2015, of september 4, on victims of crimes, the concept of “especially vulnerable victim”, to be applied in certain circumstances (age, state of health, etc.), allows verifying 289 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ that the protection guaranteed to children and young people in danger by law n.º 147/99, of september 1st, has no correspondence in adults. a reference also mentioned in the who report (who, 2014). the resolution of the council of ministers, n.º 63/2015, defines the elderly protection strategy and recognizes that advanced age presents specificities in terms of health care, social support, and family environment, as well as legal protection, which must be effectively regulated, to guarantee respect for the dignity of the human person at all stages of life. it also refers that, within the scope of the right to dignity, the elderly must be able to live with dignity and security, without being physically or psychologically exploited, and be treated fairly. also stating that elderly citizens are often expose to practices that violate their most basic rights, whose defense must ensure and guarantee their adequate and proportional legal protection. in august 2018, law n.º 49/2018, approved the regime of the greater accompanied. we are witnessing a paradigm shift, which put an end to the interdiction and disqualification processes, allowing any person who, for reasons of health, disability, or behavior, is unable to personally and consciously, exercise their rights or fulfilling his duties, may apply to the court for the necessary accompanying measures. the law n.º 100/2019, of september 6, approved the statute of the informal caregiver, which regulates the rights and duties of the caregiver and the person cared for, as well as establishing the respective support measures. more recently, regulatory decree n.º 1/2022, of january 10, highlights the simplification of the process of recognition of the informal caregiver status, the expansion of the recognition of care provided to more than one family member, and the caregiver’s rest informal to the national network of continuing integrated mental health care. although society has progressively recognized a broader set of rights for the elderly, the legal-criminal framework of violence against the elderly in portugal does not seem to be sufficient for the protection of elderly people at risk. in this perspective, it is essential to protect and promote their rights, through the creation of proximity institutions, as suggested by some public prosecutors and professionals, or adapting the scope of action to any people in a situation of risk similar to the existing commissions for the protection of children and young people (mendes & xavier, 2017). thus, prevention as a fundamental element to avoid the various forms of violence against the elderly assumes an extreme relevance, which is why the diagnosis of situations, identification of risk and protector factors, combined with an adequate and effective intervention is essential to your success. violence against the elderly: definition of concepts violence against the elderly is a global public health and human rights problem, with implications for individuals and society in general. in the literature, we can identify several terms used to define the concept of violence against the elderly, namely, mistreatment, abuse, neglect, and abandonment, among others. the who (2002), in the toronto declaration, defines the concept of elder abuse as “a single or repeated act, or lack of adequate action, that occurs within the framework of any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, that causes harm or distress to an older person”. the united nations, in 2002, defines violence as any act of a violent nature that implies or has the risk of implying, physical, sexual, or psychological harm, which may be threats, negligence, exploitation, embarrassment, arbitrary deprivation of liberty of public and private life. the world assembly on aging in 2002, similarly to the who, also defines the concept as “any act, single or repeated, or lack of appropriate action that occurs in any relationship, purported to be trusted, 290 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ that causes harm or distress, to an elderly person” (who, 2002). in addition to the concept of violence, in the literature, there are also concepts of abuse and mistreatment against the elderly. the who (2022a), defines the concept of abuse as “the intentional or unintentional action or omission, which results in unnecessary suffering, injury, pain, loss or violation of human rights and consequently a decrease in the quality of life” of the elderly. in the toronto declaration (2002), the who defines the concept of elder abuse “as any isolated or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, that occurs in any relationship where there is an expectation of trust and that causes harm, or uncomfortable for the elderly. the who (2002) distinguishes five main forms of violence against the elderly, including, a) physical violence defined as a set of actions carried out with the intention of causing physical pain or injury to the elderly (physical punishment, pushing, throwing of objects and the act of under or over medicating); b) emotional and/or verbal psychological violence, which includes all actions that cause suffering, distress, anguish, through verbal or non-verbal forms (threats, intimidation, manipulation, among others); c) sexual violence that consists of the involvement of the elderly in sexual acts without consent or without understanding its meaning (rape, sexual harassment); d) economic and financial violence, which involves the legal or inappropriate use, by formal and informal caregivers, of assets, funds or properties of the elderly person (theft, sale of properties or transfer of money without the victim’s authorization), and e) negligence, which implies omission, refusal or insufficiency in the provision of care, obligations or duties towards the elderly person (omission or refusal of food, health care, hygiene, material support, emotional support). in terms of intentionality, negligence can also be divided into two types, active, in which the aggressor denies care and acts intentionally in non-compliance, and passive, which differs from the first in that it is not conscious or intentional (branco, 2018; dias, 2004). given the above, violence against the elderly occurs through various forms of violence that may or may not coexist (apav, 2023). stressful and risk life events throughout the life cycle, multiple life events give rise to situations of imbalance with important repercussions on the level of personal and family functioning, which imply necessary changes, to allow individuals and families to adapt to new requirements. the literature has come to consider risk factors as aspects that are related to stressful or negative life events, whose implications may accentuate or increase the appearance of problems at a physical, psychological, and social level, susceptible to compromising the balanced psychosocial development of individuals (yunes, 2003; rutter, 1987). as opposed to risk and vulnerability factors, others may coexist, called protectors, whose influence may contribute to the reduction or suppression of the negative influences of exposure to risk (rutter, 1987). based on the literature review, stressful and risky life events have been consider based on two theoretical perspectives, whose approach focuses on the quantitative and qualitative point of view, to understand the incidence and implication of risk and protection factors in individual and family development. according to rutter (2005), two or more stressor aspects are necessary to have a significant impact on the healthy development of the individual, assuming that for a better understanding, their analysis should proceed on a continuum. therefore, despite the existence of numerous risk factors, their impact on the individual depends on the characteristics of the individual and their subjective view of these factors, the characteristics of these factors, and the interaction established between both aspects (rutter, 1987). the occurrence of 291 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ several risk factors simultaneously leads to poor results in several developmental indicators, including psychosocial competence, psychopathology, and health (masten & wright, 1998). risk and protection factors the contextualization of lack of protection implies, on the one hand, considering the risk factors and, on the other hand, identifying the protective factors and the contextual factors, which protect and promote the personal and social resources of individuals, can contribute to the interruption of the cycle of vulnerability (nunes, lemos, costa, nunes, & almeida, 2011). in this sense, risk factors are variables that increase the probability of a dysfunctional or pathological result occurring in an individual or group, which compromises to a greater or lesser extent the psychosocial adaptation of individuals (rodrigo, máiquez, martín, & byrne, 2008). risk factors are variables that increase the probability of a negative result occurring in the future (deković, 1999). about risk factors, we can also identify some factors that establish an important relationship with these, defined vulnerability factors, which refer to those personal or relational factors that increase the probability of the negative effects of risk situations (luthar, 2006), which is the same context, do not have this amplifying effect when the risk is not present, which explains why individuals in these circumstances have greater difficulties in psychosocial adaptation (lorence, 2008). in turn, the decrease or elimination of the negative influences of risk exposure is called protection (sapienza & pedremônico, 2005). protective factors only act in the presence of risk and can be defined as those influences that modify an individual’s response in the presence of risk situations, leading to a more positive result than would be expected (rodrigo et al., 2008). accordingly, the risk and protection factors, as well as the system’s available resources, can vary and modify the situation of families in a continuum (rodrigo et al., 2008), and the interactions they establish with each other support, qualify or change the experience of families (minuchin, 2005). conceptualization of social support social support has been raising a deep interest and occupying a privileged place in the scientific community, due to the relevance of the role and function it represents, as a multidimensional construct (ribeiro, 1999). lin and ensel (1989) define social support as the process through which the social resources made available by formal and informal support networks make it possible to satisfy the instrumental and expressive needs of individuals in their daily lives and crises. lópez et al. (2007) consider social support as a dynamic and transactional process, whose complexity refers to a mutual influence between individuals and their support networks, to promote physical and psychological well-being. in the literature, we can also identify the benefits of the role of social support in the health and well-being of individuals, including a lower incidence of physical and mental illnesses, a more positive adjustment to chronic illnesses, a reduction in stress, as well as other positive benefits for physical and psychological health (skok, harvey, & reddihough, 2006). social support is considered by several experts as a factor capable of protecting and promoting health (siqueira, 2008), has been recognized for its influence on the health and psychological well-being of 292 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ individuals (lópez & sánchez, 2001; thoits, 1982), and reducing the negative impact of negative life events (nunes, lemos, ayala-nunes, & costa, 2013). in general, social support can be assessed by the individual’s social integration in their environment, a network of services and people that are accessible to them (e.g., health services), and the individual’s perception of people and services in the community (baptista, baptista, & torres, 2006). integration and social support are essential for the elderly, providing them with emotional and practical resources, active participation, and greater self-esteem, given that more integrated people tend to enjoy better health (sns, 2017). in the literature we can identify a distinction defended about the typology of social support, distinguishing between emotional social support (affection), instrumental (tangible goods and services), informative (access to information and guidance/counseling), and evaluation (langford, bowsher, maloney, & lillis,1997; semmer, elfering, jacobshagen, & perrot, 2008). social support, in addition to constituting a theoretical construction, must be considered in the light of a dynamic and complex process, which integrates reciprocal interactions between individuals, to satisfy their social needs, promote and developing of personal resources, deal with new demands, and challenges achieve new goals. family and social support networks the family constitutes nuclear and fundamental support for all its members who usually resort to a wide range of sources of help that provide support for their functioning and routines of daily life (lópez, 2006), so any family needs a broad and effective social support network (gómez, pérez, & vila, 2001). the concept of a social network refers to a process of continuous, individual, and collective construction, which is characterized by an open system of sharing that establishes multiple relationships between the elements of a group (e.g., family, community, governmental and non-governmental organizations) with other groups, whose exchange enriches and enhances personal and social resources. thus, social networks constitute groups capable of providing support, through which psychological and material resources are promoted, which allow individuals to respond more adaptively to potentially complex and demanding real situations. social support networks have been associated with numerous protective factors of crucial importance (rodrigo et al., 2008), which include two specific types of social support networks or sources, formal and informal. informal support networks are part of the natural network of individuals, consisting of family members, neighbors, and friends, among others, and also social groups, such as voluntary organizations, and clubs, capable of providing resources and support in activities of daily living, in the presence of various normative and non-normative life events. in turn, formal social support networks involve formal social institutions, public or private, such as hospitals, health services, social security services, and professionals, namely doctors, psychologists, and social workers, among others, organized to promote and provide support and assistance, with emphasis on the provision of goods and services or financial support, to all those who need it (ribeiro, 1999). in general, people tend to resort first to informal support networks, which are closer (sousa & rodrigues, 2009), either because they embody more natural, reciprocal, and satisfactory sources of support, either because of their more private character and adapted to the specific needs of people (rodrigo et al., 2008). 293 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ social support, more specifically, family support is associated with a low prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders in individuals (baptista, 2005). in turn, the inclusion of support in the living environment of an older adult implies balancing the need for autonomy and quality of life with security (opp, 2022). the presence of multiple forms of formal support can interfere with families’ daily lives, reducing their sense of privacy and promoting the loss of responsibility for their own lives (rodrigo, martín, máiquez, & rodríguez, 2007). in this sense, interventions at the level of social support, in particular those that try to create new support providers, challenge the limits of our knowledge (barrera, 1991). therefore, the necessary efforts must be made, to expand and strengthen their informal social support networks, combining them with the support of the formal network, which unequivocally constitutes a challenge in the intervention with the elderly in a situation of vulnerability and risk. violence against the elderly and its implications the family constitutes the privileged context of the human person, in particular, of the elderly. in this perspective, the family, the community, and society have a strong impact on the way we age (cabral et al., 2013), with implications on the quality of life of the elderly, which depends on the risks and opportunities experienced throughout the life cycle and how the following generations provide mutual help and support (who, 2002). in most countries, care provided by the family is the predominant model of support, however, family members often experience high levels of stress and health problems, both physical and psychological, for which they need training and support to deal with the situation (dgs, 2017). the reduction in the proportion of young adults available with the capacity to provide the necessary care for the elderly can make this model of care provision unfeasible, making its adequacy and the implementation of other models a determining factor (who, 2012). living longer implies greater exposure to risks, such as vulnerability to health status, physical, mental, and economic dependence, stigmatization, social isolation, and loneliness (cabral et al., 2013), and abuse, whether physical, psychological, sexual, financial or material, due to discrimination or negligence (united nations economic commission for europe, 2013). who (2002) estimates that the demographic increase in the elderly will aggravate situations of violence and mistreatment, due to the rupture of family ties, and the reduction and ineffectiveness of social protection systems. accordingly, it is crucial to guarantee elderly people a social and economic support system that mitigates vulnerabilities, especially in situations of poverty and material deprivation (dgs, 2017). the elderly often have concomitant mental and physical health problems. although most people are in good mental health, cognitive disorders, including alzheimer’s disease, are frequently observed among the senior population. changes in the functional capacity of the elderly can cause emotional stress, both in individuals and in family members involved in care (schulz & martire, 2004). functional dependence or physical disability in the elderly has been consistently associated with an increased risk of elder abuse, including physical, emotional, and financial abuse (burnes et al., 2015). among the elderly who use health services, depressive and anxiety disorders are common, as well as adaptation disorders and problems arising from the incorrect use of prescribed medications (gum, king-kallimanis, & kohn 2009). on the other hand, older adults with severe mental illness present special assessment and intervention challenges, in part due to the reduced social support they face, which can result in inadequate hospitalization in healthcare institutions (harvey, 2005). the change in 294 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ the environment of the elderly is generally experienced as a threat to their safety and integrity (cardoso and costa, 2006). in the literature, we can identify several risk factors associated with the phenomenon of violence against the elderly, such as the increase in demographic aging and situations of dependence (gil, fernandes, nicolau, & santos, 2013). the elderly are at greater risk of being abused, with women being more likely than men (gil et al., 2015), and low incomes have been associated with emotional and physical abuse (burnes et al., 2015). on the other hand, transgenerational transmission, that is, individuals who would have grown up in unfavorable and violent environments (branco, 2018), intergenerational violence, which may depend on the characteristics of caregivers and care (alcoholism, drugs, mental disorders, economic difficulties) (oliveira, 2008), also emerge as factors that may be at the origin of violence. in addition to these, caregiver stress and psychological health problems (cooney, haward, & lawlor, 2006; vandeweerd, paveza, & fulmer, 2006), depression, anxiety, and frustration (gallagher-thompson et al., 2003), are common among aggressors and perpetrators of abuse against the elderly (who, 2011). caregiver depression is a predictor of physical (coyne et al., 1993), and verbal abuse (vandeweerd et al., 2006), and abusers are more likely to experience psychiatric hospitalization than non-abusers (pillemer & finkelhor, 1988). some studies have also demonstrated that aggressors often depend on victims for emotional support, financial help, housing, and or other assistance (who, 2011). in the literature, the most common type of relationship between the perpetrator of emotional and physical abuse of the elderly is the spouse or partner (burnes et al., 2015; pillemer & finkelhor, 1988), and the financial dependence of spouses and children (branco, 2008). in addition to the characteristics of the victim, the perpetrator, and the relationship between victim and perpetrator, community contexts may also place some individuals at greater risk of abuse (pillemer, burnes, riffin, & lachs 2016). older people living in urban areas are at greater risk of suffering abuse (brozowski & hall 2010), as well as a decrease in social participation, loss of self-esteem, and social isolation can contribute to the increase in the occurrence of abuse under the most diverse forms (who, 2012). accordingly, low social support is considered a dimension likely to increase the risk of violence against the elderly (alves & serrão, 2018). the elderly residing in rural areas often have difficulty accessing aging-related resources (e.g., transportation, community centers, and meal programs) and may experience low levels of social support and high levels of isolation (guralnick, kemele, stamm, & greving, 2003). at the end of life, suicide is a reality, which deserves special concern on the part of helping professionals, assessing the risk of suicide among the elderly. in several countries, the suicide rate is higher in old age, with suicide rates among the elderly being among the highest observed for any age group (kochanek., xu, murphy, miniño, & kung, 2012), and attempts are usually more lethal (oliveira, j. 2008). attitudes of segregation and stereotypes that persist to the final period of the life cycle defined as ageism, call into question solidarity and social cohesion, indispensable factors for social justice, the well-being of individuals, and the health of communities (dgs, 2016). in this sense, suicide in the elderly can be approached from different perspectives, including, ageism, stereotypes, or prejudices that lead to discrimination against people because they are old (oliveira, 2008). accordingly, preventive efforts should be developed aimed at the older population, suicide prevention, at the level of primary health care (bruce et al., 2004), through better recognition and diagnosis 295 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ of depressive symptoms, among other, risk factors (huh et al. 2012), and their referral for appropriate treatment (pearson & brown, 2000). the elderly can be perceived as fragile, dependent, or burdensome, and negative attitudes and stereotypes may contribute to the social acceptance of abuse (nelson, 2005; who, 2011). in addition to the need to change negative stereotypes, by promoting a positive image of the elderly, it is necessary to ensure the safety of those who are exposed to this type of risk (dgs, 2017). the literature has shown that the lack of social support is positively related to suicide (minayo & cavalante, 2010), and the treatment of depressive symptoms among older primary care patients reduces suicidal ideation (bruce et al., 2004). in addition to isolation, depression, mental and physical health, in which aggressions imply physical integrity or health is neglected by caregivers, often when the elderly is already weakened by illnesses (oliveira, 2008), abuse of the elderly can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences, increased risk of institutionalization, use of emergency services, hospitalization and premature death (who, 2022b). these situations, when undetected, severely compromise the victims’ quality of life and their survival time (dgs, 2016). strategies to prevent and combat situations of violence against the elderly are particularly relevant, which may include, awareness campaigns, mandatory reporting of abuse to the authorities, detection of possible victims and aggressors, intergenerational programs in schools, policies to support structures of residential care for seniors, and caregiver support interventions (branco, 2018). interventions when specifically for abusive caregivers can help prevent revictimization (reay & browne, 2002). on the other hand, money management (sacks, romanick, caron, morano, & fahs, 2012; who, 2022b), telephone support lines (pillemer, burnes, riffin, & lachs, 2016), shelters and emergency houses (moracco & cole, 2009; who, 2022b), providing security, to allow the implementation of a plan of successful safety (heck & gillespie, 2013) can contribute to reducing elder abuse. finally, the intervention of multidisciplinary teams and interdisciplinary collaboration (who, 2022b), require coordination of available services (pillemer, et al., 2016), which are intended to be integrated, in continuity and proximity, essential in the care of the elderly person, guaranteeing the efficiency and sustainability of the available resources. in this sense, the success of interventions and responses implies the involvement and intervention of the various systems, including health care, mental health care, the social area, protection services, and criminal justice, with a view to their effective protection, removal of situations of risk and vulnerability, promoting their rights and safeguarding human dignity. conclusion the growing recognition of the phenomenon of violence against the elderly has been considered by organizations, at international, national, and local levels, as a serious violation of human rights and one of the greatest public and social health challenges of the xxi century, which have been constituting a concern in their priorities and policies. aging constitutes a victory for socioeconomic development and public health, which together implies the challenge of adapting to society (who, 2015), given that the impact of population aging on society will also depend on the nature of the policies aimed at this new reality (who, 2012). 296 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ the promotion and continuity of the development of transversal policies and multidisciplinary, flexible, and proximity action strategies are fundamental, to allowing all elderly to enjoy an active and healthy life (sns, 2017). accordingly, local government has played a fundamental role by promoting partnerships, mobilizing resources, and developing action programs in the field of protecting the elderly and promoting active and healthy aging. the who, in 2010, created the global network of age-friendly cities and communities to connect cities, communities, and organizations around the world with a common vision of making communities a great place to age. this network operates at the local level, promoting the full participation of the elderly in community life, through policies, services, and support structures, which promote active aging and recognize the capabilities and resources of older people, responding flexibly to their needs and protecting the most vulnerable by promoting their inclusion and contribution in all aspects of community life. the order of portuguese psychologists (opp), in 2019, promoted a national initiative, through the attribution of a “pro-aging communities” seal, in recognition of the implementation and adoption of policies, programs, projects, and good practices, which demonstrate serious and effective commitment to the promotion of active and healthy aging. if, on the one hand, the studies carried out to date have enabled the recognition of some of the determinants and patterns of active and healthy aging, the identification of barriers to its achievement, the development of successful strategies for its promotion and the dissemination of good practices adopted in different contexts, require investment in research in a systematic, organized and oriented way (sns, 2017). in recent decades, scientific evidence has contributed to the deepening of knowledge and violence prevention strategies, which include interventions at individual, interpersonal (close relationships), community, and social levels (who, 2022a). the elderly are often exposed to practices that violate their most basic rights, so it would be desirable to delineate a global and homogeneous regime, which enshrines legal protection solutions that respect their dignity. the protection of the elderly has been a national concern, materializing in many municipalities, through the constitution of protection commissions for the elderly or working groups created within the scope of the social network that emerged intending to protect and promote the rights of the elderly, to guarantee their well-being, physical and mental integrity. these commissions and working groups intervene exclusively at the local level, exercising their competence in the respective territorial area, with their regulations, and with no specific and standardized legal framework at the national level. the progressive rise of social and political awareness, concerning the need to intervene effectively in the face of the problem of violence against the elderly, arises the need to create a protection law and a national commission for the promotion of the rights and protection of elderly, similarly to the legal framework regarding children and young people in risk, with the appropriate and respective legal framework. the signaling and contextualization of each case, in particular, are fundamental, to allow institutions and professionals to identify and evaluate the processes of vulnerability and risk situations, which allows making a diagnosis and planning intervention strategies appropriate, to reverse risk situations and promote the defense and protection of the rights of the elderly. institutional articulation and interdisciplinary collaboration, which require the involvement of the social, health, education, security, and justice sectors, are fundamental and can contribute to reducing abuse of the elderly people. 297 challenges from protecting the elderly to promoting active and healthy aging ﻿ in this sense, the necessary efforts must be made, to expand and strengthen their informal social support networks, combining them with the support of the formal network, which unequivocally constitutes a challenge in the intervention aimed at the elderly population in situations of risk and vulnerability. in recent years, we have witnessed an evident concern on the part of services and recognition of the importance of professionals in terms of social support structures. continuous and direct contact with situations of violence and victims of crime is one of the most specific, demanding, and challenging experiences that professionals from the most diverse areas and functions can experience (manita, ribeiro & peixoto, 2009). accordingly, professionals must be informed about the applicable legal framework and existing resources in the local community, applying their scientific knowledge in promoting active, healthy, and successful aging. the articulation between the different institutions and the public ministry is also a fundamental priority, so that the final decision on the objective in question obtains a satisfactory result, for the protection, and promotion
