(2010) proposed various policy reforms to tackle the economic consequences of population aging, such as raising the legal retirement age. the extension of the retirement age would facilitate more older persons to work and remain active in the labor market, and this, in turn, would increase the proportion of the working population and subsequently contribute to the national output, thereby offsetting the negative impact of population aging on economic growth. the mitigating effect of labor force participation of older people in the aging–economic growth association model postulated by bloom et al. (2010) has been widely applied in developed countries. for instance, the model was found to be viable in france, germany and italy, where the negative impact of population aging on growth was reduced by the increasing share of older persons in the labor market due to a rise in the legal retirement age (vogel et al. 2017). nevertheless, this might not be the case in developing countries, as the degree of ageism toward older persons was found to be more prevalent than that in developed countries (nash et al. 2018). the presence of ageism in the labor market might impede the economic contribution of older people if they are assigned trivial tasks with lower productivity and income. this implies that the labor force participation of older people under the ageism setting in developing countries is inconclusive in mitigating the negative consequences of population aging on economic growth. hence, the applicability of the model by bloom et al. (2010) in developing countries remains contentious. the present study fills in the research gap by quantifying the role of labor force participation of older people in the aging–growth nexus in developing countries. 1877 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 in general, developing countries have a lower capacity and credit constrained in addressing the economic consequences imposed by population aging than developed countries. most advanced economies have access to the international financial market for their currencies and allow them to borrow internationally using their national currencies, but this is often not the case for most developing countries. the presence of credit constraints, coupled with the rapid population aging, would result in insufficient resources to overcome the negative influence of population aging on economic growth. therefore, it is imperative to examine the mitigating role of the labor force participation of older people in overcoming the economic consequences caused by population aging, especially in the developing countries with limited resources and economically unprepared to embrace the increasing proportion of older people. this study aims to investigate the role of labor force participation of older people in mitigating the negative impact of population aging on economic growth, motivated by the dearth of research on this issue and the importance of the findings in preserving the sustainable growth of developing countries. because the older populations are increasing rapidly in the developing countries, early preparation for an aging society is crucial for these countries to have sustainable economic development, and to cater to the needs of the fast-rising number of older people. the current study adopts the mitigating effect of labor force participation of older people in the aging–economic growth association model postulated by bloom et al. (2010). a preview of the empirical results shows that population aging is inversely related to the per capita growth rate, and labor force participation of older persons is essential in mitigating the negative relationship. population aging has a significant adverse effect on economic growth if the labor force participation of older people is at a low level. however, the negative effect becomes less apparent and turns into a positive effect as the labor force participation of older people increases. the results remain robust in a series of robustness checks. this study contributes to the existing literature from three aspects. firstly, the present analysis validates the role of labor force participation of older people in the aging–growth nexus in developing countries. a similar study has been conducted in developed countries (see vogel et al. 2017), but there is a dearth of research focusing on developing countries. secondly, this paper puts forth the alternative model specification by providing the marginal effect of population aging on growth at various levels of labor force participation of older people, which complements and expands the previous study performed by vogel et al. (2017). thirdly, although the aging–growth association was well established (see maity and sinha 2020, mamun et al. 2020, pan and chang 2019, pham and vo 2021, and saccone 2017), the recommendation to overcome the negative consequences of population aging is often neglected in past literature. hence, the present study identifies the potential factor that is useful in overcoming the growth-deteriorating effect of population aging. population aging is inevitable, and thus, it is time to ascertain the ways to overcome the negative impact of population aging on economic growth in developing countries. this paper is structured as follows. section 2 provides a theoretical review on the mitigating role of labor force participation of older people in the aging–growth nexus. section 3 describes the data, empirical model, and methodology of this study. 1878 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 1 3 section 4 presents the baseline estimation results, followed by the robustness checks in sect. 5. section 6 sets forth policy implications and recommendations, followed by the limitations of the study in sect. 7, and sect. 8 concludes the paper. 2 theoretical review the mitigating effect of older persons’ labor force participation in the aging–growth nexus was first proposed by bloom et al (2010) in a well-cited policy brief paper. the authors presumed that an increase in the legal retirement age would induce older persons to remain active in the labor market, thereby offsetting the adverse impact of population aging on economic growth. however, the study did not outline the theoretical justifications on how older persons’ labor force participation can mitigate the economic implications of population aging. a recent study by vogel et al (2017) suggested two possible channels in justifying the mitigating effect. firstly, the labor force channel reveals that an increase in the retirement age would induce older persons to work longer and remain active in the labor market. this in turn would increase the working population and per capita output, thereby mitigating the adverse impact of population aging on economic growth. the working population is the primary contributor to the production of output in the economy. hence, the increasing number of older persons who remain active in the labor market would increase the share of the working population and reduce the proportion of dependents in the economy. taken together, more labor is involved in the production and a lower proportion of the population is consuming the national resources, thereby offsetting the economic consequences of population aging. secondly, the human capital channel explains that an increase in the retirement age would extend the work-life planning horizon of households, thereby amplifying the incentives to invest in human capital accumulation. in general, older people who remain active in the labor market would receive a steady income stream, which can be used to invest in the child’s education within the household. greater human capital accumulation would result in higher per capita output, thereby mitigating the adverse impact of population aging on economic growth. 3 methods 3.1 data this study utilized unbalanced panel data of 74 developing countries listed in table 1. country development status was based on the classification by the international monetary fund (imf) (imf 2019). the annual data were taken from the world development indicators (wdi) and the ilo database for 1990–2019. 1879 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 notably, these two databases are the major data sources for aging studies and have been widely used in the empirical studies examining the impact of population aging on economic growth (bloom et al. 2010; maity and sinha 2020; pan and chang 2019; saccone 2017; teixeira et al. 2016). the sampled countries and periods selected were based on data available on the labor force participation rate of the population aged 65 and above. the study period was averaged into 5-year intervals,1 with a maximum of six observations for each country: between 1990 and 1994, 1995 and 1999, 2000 and 2004, 2005 and 2009, 2010 and 2014, 2015 and 2019. the averaging procedure filtered out the effect of business cycle fluctuations and therefore improves the accuracy of the estimations. table 2 shows the list of variables used in this study. 3.2 empirical model according to the united nations (2002) and the world health organization (2011), the proportion of the population aged 65 and above is one of the conventional indicators used to measure the pace of population aging. this study employs the united nations’ (2019b) definition, in which older persons refer to those aged 65 years or over. hence, this study defines the ‘older workers’ as individuals aged 65 and above that remain in the labor force. the empirical model used to examine the relationship between population aging and economic growth is shown as eq. (1). where i is the country index, t is the time index, rgdpc is the growth rate of real gross domestic product (gdp) per capita, popage65 is the proportion of the population aged 65 and above, lfpr65 is the labor force participation rate of the population aged 65 and above, x is a vector of control variables (which include gross capital formation, population growth rate, trade openness, secondary school enrolment ratio, and the ratio of domestic credit to private sector). these control variables rgdpc (1) it = 0 + 1 popage65 it−1 + 2 lfpr65 it−1 + 3x it−1 + v i + it table 1 list of sampled countries (sample period: 1990–2019) 74 developing countries algeria, angola, argentina, azerbaijan, bangladesh, belarus, benin, bolivia, brazil, burkina faso, cambodia, cameroon, chad, chile, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, republic of the congo, cote d’ivoire, croatia, cyprus, czech republic, dominican republic, ecuador, egypt, estonia, ethiopia, ghana, guinea, haiti, honduras, hungary, india, indonesia, iran, kazakhstan, kenya, kyrgyz republic, lao pdr, libya, madagascar, malaysia, mali, mexico, moldova, mongolia, morocco, mozambique, myanmar, nepal, nicaragua, niger, nigeria, pakistan, papua new guinea, peru, philippines, russian federation, rwanda, senegal, south africa, sri lanka, sudan, tajikistan, tanzania, thailand, turkey, uganda, ukraine, uzbekistan, vietnam, yemen, zambia, and zimbabwe 1 the 5-year interval is a common method used in filtering the business cycle effect for panel data (law 2018). meanwhile, the 6-year average data are used in the robustness check. 1880 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 1 3 table 2 list of variables notes data for older population and labor force participation rate were extracted from ilo database. other variables were obtained from wdi database. according to rowland (2003), aging index (ai65) is computed by taking the ratio of total population aged 65 and above to total population aged 0 to 14 multiply by 100 variables description unit of measurement variables for baseline model rgdpc growth of real gdp per capita % popage65 population aged 65 and above % of total population lfpr65 labor force participation rate, aged 65 and above % of population aged 65 and above gcf gross capital formation % of gdp population population growth rate % openness trade openness (export + import) % of gdp secondary secondary school enrolment ratio % of gross credit domestic credit to private sector % of gdp variables for robustness check inflation inflation rate % density population density people per square kilometer une unemployment rate % of total labor force urban urban population % of total population fdi net inflow of foreign direct investment % of gdp dependency old-age dependency ratio % of working age population ai65 aging index number of persons aged 65 and above per 100 persons aged 0–14 lfpr65female female labor force participation rate, aged 65 and above % of female population aged 65 and above lfpr65male male labor force participation rate, aged 65 and above % of male population aged 65 and above 1881 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 were widely used in the economic growth literature (intisar et al. 2020; khan et al. 2019; law et al. 2013, 2018; law and singh 2014; topcu et al. 2020), by taking into consideration the impacts of investment, demographic changes, international trade, human capital, and financial development on economic growth, respectively. the vi represents the unobserved country-specific effect term, and εit is the error term. all the independent variables tend to be endogenous, and therefore, each of these variables is replaced with its own lagged 1-year value to address the endogeneity issue (due to the reverse causality between dependent and independent variables). notably, the utilization of lagged one-period value has been commonly practiced across a wide variety of disciplines in economics and finance to mitigate the endogeneity issue in the model (chia et al. 2020; ibrahim 2019a, 2019b; ibrahim and law 2019; ibrahim et al. 2019). the coefficient β1 in eq. (1) measures the effect of population aging on economic growth. the influence of population aging on economic growth was conditional upon the labor force participation of older people. bloom et al. (2010) proposed that the increase in retirement age is necessary in overcoming the shrinking labor force and mitigating the negative economic consequences of population aging. since this study investigates the role of older workers in the nexus between economic growth and population aging, eq. (1) is therefore extended to incorporate the interaction between the aging population and labor force participation of older persons, as in eq. (2). the inclusion of the interaction term enables identifying the impact of population aging on economic growth at the varying degree of older persons’ participation in the labor force. the marginal effect of population aging on economic growth depends on β3 after adding the interaction term, as in eq. (3). that is, static panel estimators, namely the pooled ordinary least square (pols), fixed effect model (fem), and random effect model (rem) were used to estimate eqs. (1) and (2). stata version 14 was used to perform all data analysis. robust standard error was computed to preclude heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the error term. additional control variables such as inflation rate, population density, unemployment rate, percent living in urban areas, and the net inflow of foreign direct investment were included in the robustness check to avoid omitted variable bias in the model. the inclusion of these variables is guided by the economic growth literature (azman-saini et al. 2010; diebolt and hippe 2019; ibrahim 2007; okun 1963; topcu et al. 2020). alternative measures for aging population, namely the old-age dependency ratio and aging index, were included in the model to avoid the measurement error. in addition, the aggregate labor force participation rate of older people was substituted with the gender-specific labor force participation rate of older persons to identify the roles of older female and male workers in mitigating the negative consequences of population aging. all the variables used in the robustness check are shown in table 2.

(2006) argued that it is inappropriate to interpret the coefficients of old age population (popage65) and older persons’ labor force participation rate (lfpr65) if the model contains an interaction term, as the former captures the effect of population aging on economic growth only if the older persons’ labor force participation rate is equal to zero. the latter provides the effect of older persons’ labor force participation rate on economic growth only if population aging is equal to zero. thus, the coefficients of popage65 and lfpr65 are meaningless with the inclusion of interaction term in the model. the interaction term (popage65 × lfpr65) is positive and significant at the 1% level (column 8), and this indicates the significant effect of labor force participation of older people in mitigating the negative effect of population aging on economic growth. as suggested by brambor et al. (2006), the marginal effect of population aging on economic growth was computed at different levels of labor force participation of notes all statistics were calculated based on the 5-year average data values. ln denotes natural logarithm. sample period: 1990–2019 (5-year average) table 4 (continued) fdi dependency ai65 lfpr65female fdi 1.000 dependency 0.190 1.000 ai65 0.196 0.978 1.000 lfpr65female − 0.127 − 0.519 − 0.495 1.000 lfpr65male − 0.168 − 0.672 − 0.676 0.856 lfpr65male lfpr65male 1.000 1885 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 table 5 baseline results dependent variable growth of real gdp per capita (rgdpc) equations equation (1): without interaction term equation (2): with interaction term estimation methods pols rem fem rem robust pols rem fem rem robust independent variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 constant 6.552*** 6.501*** 3.639 6.501*** 7.141*** 7.250*** 6.208** 7.250*** (1.267) (1.371) (2.632) (1.290) (1.260) (1.369) (2.984) (1.353) popage65it−1 − 0.180*** − 0.166** − 0.041 − 0.166** − 0.242*** − 0.246*** − 0.464 − 0.246*** (0.068) (0.083) (0.306) (0.076) (0.070) (0.086) (0.385) (0.061) lfpr65it−1 − 0.023* − 0.025* 0.011 − 0.025 − 0.079*** − 0.087*** − 0.094 − 0.087*** (0.012) (0.015) (0.054) (0.019) (0.022) (0.026) (0.079) (0.032) popage65it−1 × lfpr65it− 1 – – – – 0.015*** 0.016*** 0.023* 0.016*** (0.005) (0.006) (0.013) (0.005) gcfit−1 0.041* 0.008 − 0.047 0.008 0.038* 0.008 − 0.051 0.008 (0.022) (0.024) (0.031) (0.037) (0.021) (0.023) (0.031) (0.036) populationit−1 − 1.100*** − 0.870*** − 0.638** − 0.870*** − 1.016*** − 0.809*** − 0.578** − 0.809*** (0.234) (0.223) (0.248) (0.276) (0.232) (0.222) (0.248) (0.278) opennessit−1 − 0.001 − 0.001 0.003 − 0.001 0.003 0.004 0.009 0.004 (0.005) (0.006) (0.012) (0.006) (0.005) (0.006) (0.012) (0.006) secondary it−1 − 0.030*** − 0.020* 0.015 − 0.020* − 0.041*** − 0.033*** 0.012 − 0.033** (0.010) (0.012) (0.026) (0.011) (0.010) (0.013) (0.026) (0.013) creditit−1 0.004 − 0.001 − 0.007 − 0.001 − 0.001 − 0.005 − 0.007 − 0.005 (0.005) (0.006) (0.016) (0.008) (0.005) (0.007) (0.016) (0.007) 1886 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 1 3 notes values in parentheses are standard errors. columns 4 and 8 show the robust standard error estimates. sample period: 1990–2019 (5-year average) *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively table 5 (continued) dependent variable growth of real gdp per capita (rgdpc) equations equation (1): without interaction term equation (2): with interaction term estimation methods pols rem fem rem robust pols rem fem rem robust model selection tests bp-lm test: p-value – 0.000*** – – – 0.000*** – – hausman test: p-value – 0.165 – – – 0.216 – – poolability f-test: p-value – – 0.000*** – – – 0.000*** – time dummies yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 1887 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 older people to exhibit its mitigating effect. the role of older workers in mitigating the negative effect of population aging on economic growth is shown in the marginal effect diagram (fig. 1). population aging has a significant and negative effect on economic growth if the older persons’ labor force participation rate is at the minimum level (1.514%). the negative effect corresponded to the intercept of the solid marginal effect line (− 0.221%). however, the negative impact of population aging on economic growth diminishes and becomes positive with the rising labor force participation of older persons. this study demonstrates the fundamental role of labor force participation of older people in mitigating the inverse relationship between population aging and economic growth, and this corroborates the hypothesis posited by bloom et al. (2010) and the empirical findings by vogel et al. (2017). the effect of population aging on economic growth was found to be conditional upon varying degrees of older persons’ labor force participation. this study shows that a higher rate of labor force participation of older people is important to grapple with the consequences of population aging. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||| ||||| ||||||||| |||||| |||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||| || | |||| ||| | -.35 -.2 0 .2 .35 .5 .65 .8 .95 1.1 1.25 1.4 1.55 1.7 1.85 2 marginal effect 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 percentage of observations 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 lfpr65 fig. 1 marginal effect of the proportion of old age population on economic growth. notes (1) the figure provides marginal effect (solid line) and its 90% confidence interval (dotted lines), with the frequency distribution of old age labor force participation rate (histogram).

(1) and (2) were winsorized at the: (i) 1st and 99th percentiles, and (ii) 5th and 95th percentiles. table 7 shows the estimation results. based on the marginal effect estimates, economic growth was negatively influenced by population aging when the labor force participation rate of older persons is low. however, the relationship was mitigated by the higher labor force participation of older people. thus, the mitigating effect of older workers remains robust and not affected by outliers. 1889 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 table 6 robustness check with additional control variables notes values in parentheses are robust standard errors. ln denotes natural logarithm. sample period: 1990–2019 (5-year average) *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively dependent variable growth of real gdp per capita (rgdpc) estimation methods fem rem rem rem rem rem independent variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 constant 7.047** 5.212*** 7.512*** 7.620*** 7.302*** 7.134*** (2.867) (1.427) (1.531) (1.264) (1.328) (1.422) popage65it−1 − 0.420 − 0.252*** − 0.255*** − 0.199*** − 0.253*** − 0.254*** (0.276) (0.066) (0.062) (0.066) (0.061) (0.060) lfpr65it−1 − 0.098 − 0.087*** − 0.096*** − 0.089*** − 0.090** − 0.072*** (0.084) (0.030) (0.036) (0.031) (0.032) (0.024) popage65it− 1 × lfpr65it− 1 0.020* 0.016*** 0.017*** 0.017*** 0.017*** 0.014*** (0.011) (0.005) (0.006) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) gcfit−1 − 0.067 0.003 0.003 0.010 0.008 − 0.011 (0.043) (0.035) (0.038) (0.034) (0.036) (0.035) populationit−1 − 0.703*** − 0.741** − 0.755*** − 0.687** − 0.811*** − 0.917*** (0.128) (0.286) (0.288) (0.303) (0.273) (0.127) opennessit−1 0.008 0.006 0.010 0.002 0.004 0.004 (0.011) (0.005) (0.006) (0.005) (0.006) (0.005) secondary it−1 0.009 − 0.029** − 0.028* − 0.005 − 0.032** − 0.006 (0.029) (0.013) (0.015) (0.013) (0.014) (0.015) creditit−1 0.001 − 0.008 − 0.005 − 0.005 − 0.008 − 0.005 (0.016) (0.007) (0.009) (0.007) (0.010) (0.010) inflationit−1 − 0.001*** – – – – − 0.001*** (0.001) (0.000) lndensityit−1 – 0.474** – – – 0.272 (0.195) (0.203) uneit−1 – – − 0.023 – – − 0.045 (0.039) (0.039) urbanit−1 – – – − 0.053*** – − 0.036** (0.014) (0.016) fdiit−1 – – – – 0.012 0.013 (0.011) (0.010) marginal effect minimum − 0.390 − 0.227*** − 0.229*** − 0.173** − 0.227*** − 0.233*** (0.268) (0.067) (0.062) (0.068) (0.062) (0.060) mean 0.232 0.282 0.319 0.376* 0.302 0.219 (0.323) (0.187) (0.205) (0.196) (0.188) (0.160) maximum 1.218 1.088** 1.186** 1.245*** 1.140** 0.935** (0.799) (0.429) (0.497) (0.451) (0.445) (0.388) model selection test hausman test: p-value 0.023** 0.266 0.723 0.509 0.152 0.194 time dummies yes yes yes yes yes yes 1890 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 1 3 table 7 robustness check by controlling for outliers dependent variable growth of real gdp per capita (rgdpc) methods to control for outliers winsorize: 1st and 99th winsorize: 5th and 95th cook distance test estimation method rem rem rem rem rem rem independent variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 constant 7.899*** 8.252*** 7.522*** 7.817*** 6.196*** 6.329*** (1.779) (1.488) (1.786) (1.567) (1.914) (1.946) popage65it−1 − 0.279*** − 0.306*** − 0.305*** − 0.348*** − 0.231*** − 0.232*** (0.078) (0.065) (0.091) (0.079) (0.083) (0.073) lfpr65 it−1 − 0.089** − 0.063** − 0.092*** − 0.065*** − 0.084*** − 0.087*** (0.037) (0.025) (0.033) (0.024) (0.030) (0.024) popage65it−1 × lfpr65it− 1 0.017*** 0.012** 0.018*** 0.012** 0.016*** 0.016*** (0.006) (0.005) (0.006) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) gcfit−1 0.006 − 0.012 0.009 − 0.001 0.014 − 0.017 (0.037) (0.034) (0.033) (0.028) (0.035) (0.032) populationit−1 − 0.967* − 1.282*** − 0.897* − 1.311*** − 0.631 − 0.708** (0.534) (0.238) (0.507) (0.254) (0.465) (0.328) opennessit−1 0.005 0.004 0.004 0.003 0.004 0.005 (0.006) (0.006) (0.006) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) secondary it−1 − 0.033** − 0.011 − 0.028** − 0.013 − 0.026** − 0.007 (0.013) (0.015) (0.012) (0.015) (0.013) (0.015) creditit−1 − 0.008 − 0.004 − 0.011 − 0.009 − 0.003 − 0.008 (0.009) (0.010) (0.009) (0.008) (0.008) (0.008) inflationit−1 – − 0.001 -

(2) is re-estimated by substituting the aggregate labor force participation rate of older persons (lfpr65) with the older female (lfpr65female) and male (lfpr65male) labor force participation rates.

the estimation results based on older female and male labor force participation, respectively. contrary to the general perception that older female workers have a less significant contribution to the national output, the results show that older female workers were important in overcoming the negative impact of population aging on growth in developing countries. the marginal effect shows that both older female and male labor force participation was significant in mitigating the negative impact of population aging on economic growth. the aging population poses a negative impact on economic growth when the older female and male participation in the labor force is at a low level. however, this analysis shows that the negative impact was mitigated by the increasing labor force participation of older females and males. the result indicates that older female and male labor force participation are equally important in addressing the economic consequences of population aging. hence, the result reaffirms the baseline finding based on the aggregate labor force participation rate of older persons. the mitigating effect of the labor force participation rate of older persons remains robust and does not suffer from aggregation bias. 5.5 alternative sample period the robustness check in this section is based on the alternative sample period. the baseline result for the model with an interaction term (eq. 2) is estimated using the 5-year average data. alternatively, the sample period can be averaged into 6-year intervals, with a maximum of five observations for each country: between 1990 and 1995, 1996 and 2001, 2002 and 2007, 2008 and 2013, 2014 and 2019, and the result is shown in table 11. the result is similar to the baseline finding, in which the coefficients for the interaction term remain positive and significant for all the equations. the marginal effect shows that population aging reduces economic growth, but the effect is mitigated by the higher labor force participation rate of older persons. notes values in parentheses are robust standard errors. ln denotes natural logarithm *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%

different aging status. the united nations and the world health organization consider society as ‘aging’ when 7% of the total population is aged 65 years and above. the urgency of overcoming the impact of population aging on economic growth is felt much more in countries with a large percentage of older persons (7% and above), such as in china, thailand, and vietnam. in contrast, the problems of population aging are less pressing in most countries in the african continent given the relatively large base of young people. hence, the sampled developing countries are further classified according to the percentage of older persons. the country classification is shown in appendix 1. to examine the mitigating effect of older persons’ labor force participation in these two groups of countries, the baseline eq. (2) is extended by incorporating a new dummy variable of aging and its interaction terms with the proportion of the population aged 65 and above (popage65), labor force participation rate of older persons (lfpr65) and the interaction between popage65 and lfpr65 (popage65 × lfpr65), as written below: the aging dummy variable takes the value of 1 for countries with at least 7% of older persons and 0 otherwise.3 table 12 shows the rem estimation results for countries with less than 7% of older persons and countries with at least 7% of older persons. the marginal effect estimate indicates that when the labor force participation rate of older persons is at a low level, an increase in the older population would negatively influence economic performance, but the negative impact is mitigated by rising labor force participation of older people, regardless of the status of population aging. the results suggest that the baseline finding on the role of older persons’ labor force participation in mitigating the negative effect of population aging on economic growth remains robust and is not affected by the country’s aging status. 5.7 alternative estimation method economic growth is widely perceived to be dynamic in nature, and the current rate of growth is dependent on the past growth rate. hence, empirical analysis related to economic growth tends to employ a dynamic model by including the initial income of gdp per capita as the explanatory variable to control for the dynamic effect and avoid model misspecification error (azman-saini et al. 2010; law et al. 2018; law and singh 2014). in this regard, the static panel estimator used in the earlier analysis may produce biased estimates due to the omission of the initial income variable in the model. thus, to account for the dynamic effect of economic growth, the baseline eq. (2) is extended as below: (4) rgdpc it =0 + 1 popage65 it−1 + 2 lfpr65 it−1 + 3(popage65 it−1 × lfpr65 it−1) + 4 aging i + 5(aging i × popage65 it−1) + 6(aging i × lfpr65 it−1) + 7(aging i × popage65 it−1 × lfpr65 it−1) + 8x it−1 + v i + it 3 the computation of marginal effect for eq.

(5). this technique was commonly used in the growth literature (azman-saini et al. 2010; law et al. 2018). the estimation was conducted based on the xtabond2 routine proposed by roodman (2009a). apart from addressing nickell’s bias, the gmm estimator is an instrumental variable estimator that utilizes the internal instrument in mitigating the endogeneity issue that arises from the reverse causality between economic growth and aging population. as indicated by nagarajan et al. (2021), the economic growth of a country will alter the social structure of households and lead to fertility decline. this in turn would lead to accelerated population aging. thus, the gmm estimator can be used to address the endogeneity problem and provides a robustness check on the baseline result. in the empirical estimation, this study encompasses ibrahim’s (2019b) recommendation by replacing all the independent variables with its own lagged 1-year value to address the instrument proliferation problem in gmm estimator. moreover, the system gmm estimator consists of two variants: the one-step and two-step estimators. the one-step estimator provides an efficient estimate in the presence of a small cross-section unit. the two-step estimator is asymptotically more efficient than the one-step estimator because it uses optimal weighting matrices (azman-saini et al. 2010). however, its application to a sample with a small cross-section dimension may lead to biased standard errors.

economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 finite sample correction to address the severe downward bias in the standard errors of the two-step system gmm estimates (windmeijer 2005). both estimators are used in estimating eq. (5) to ensure robustness. this study follows roodman’s (2009a) suggestion in using the forward orthogonal deviations to remove the individual-specific effect. this method is more efficient than the first-difference transformation as it minimizes data loss in the unbalanced panel. furthermore, all the regressors are likely to be endogenous, and the standard treatment is to instrumentalize these variables with lag two and longer in the firstdifference equation and lag one of the first-difference in the level equation (roodman 2009a). however, this would result in an instrument proliferation problem, due to the small number of countries in this study. hence, not all the available lags will be used as an instrument. instead, the independent variables will be instrumentalized with lag two in the first-difference equation and lag one of the first-difference in the level equation,4 as suggested by roodman (2009b). the consistency of gmm estimator depends on two specification tests, namely the hansen j test of too many instruments and the autocorrelation test in the disturbances (arellano and bond 1991). failure to reject the null hypothesis for the hansen j test indicates no instrument proliferation. for the autocorrelation test, one should not reject the absence of the second-order autocorrelation (ar(2)). table 13 shows the estimation result of the system gmm estimator. the lagged one of initial income (initial) is insignificant for all the equations, indicating the absence of dynamic effect in the model. this reinforces the utilization of a static panel estimator in the earlier analysis. notably, the role of older workers in mitigating the negative influence of population aging on economic growth is significant and consistent throughout, thereby reaffirming that the baseline result is robust to the endogeneity of aging population. the marginal effect estimate shows that population aging impeded economic growth when the labor force participation rate of older persons is low. however, the negative effect of population aging turns positive at a higher level of labor force participation rate of older people. post estimation diagnostic tests suggested that the estimation results of one- and two-step system gmm are valid. as such, failure to reject the hansen j test indicated the validity of instruments used in the estimator. similarly, failure to reject the null hypothesis of arellano-bond statistic for error autocorrelation indicated the absence of error correlation. in addition, the number of instruments was less than the number of cross-section countries, indicating the absence of instrument proliferation problem. 6 policy implications and recommendations this study analyzes the aging–economic growth nexus using panel data from 74 developing countries between 1990 and 2019. specifically, this study explores the potential influence of older workers in mitigating the relationship between population aging and economic growth. this study draws attention to the importance of 4 in the context of xtabond2, this statement refers to the specification of lag (2 2). 1906 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 1 3 promoting the participation of older people in countering the adverse effect of population aging on economic growth, as the developing countries will be aging rapidly in the coming decades. it is prudent for developing countries to tap the vast pool of the resources of older people for sustainable economic development. rising life expectancy is a demographic trend worldwide, which has led to rapid population aging and affected the accumulation of productive factors (he and li 2020). keeping equitable economic development in a rapidly aging nation requires proper labor market policy planning. developing countries can follow the policies and strategies of the european nations to abolish the retirement age, to allow older persons to work beyond the current retirement age. raising the labor force participation of older people is crucial for sustained economic growth to grapple with the consequences of population aging. besides, the government and employers can provide better incentives such as flexible workspace and working hours, as well as tax rebates for both older employees and their employers to encourage and facilitate the labor force participation of older people. however, it is important to note that the economic impacts of population aging are likely to vary across countries (bloom et al. 2010). as such, the active aging programs need to be designed with care and country-specific. for instance, developing countries with a high proportion of older people, such as china and vietnam have taken various measures to establish a comprehensive aging policy system. in china, some of the policy measures include the establishment of the national working commission on aging issues (1983), the 7-year programme on aging (1994), the law on protection of rights and interests of older persons (1996, revised in 2013), the decision to strengthen the work on aging (2001), 10th 5-year plan on development of undertakings on aging (2001), and the 13th 5-year plan for development of undertakings on aging and old age support system (2017) (zhu et al. 2019). vietnam’s policy measures on aging include the ordinance on elderly people (2000), law on the elderly 2009 (2010), and the national action program on older persons 2012–2020 (2012) (vietnam national committee on ageing and unfpa 2019). some developing countries in southeast asia, such as thailand and malaysia have considered a corporate income tax deduction and incentives for employing senior citizens (ministry of finance malaysia 2018; teerawichitchainan et al. 2019). other developing countries can thus draw on these countries’ experiences in designing a pragmatic policy and programs for older persons. good health is essential to prolong the working life of older people. health is a major impediment to the labor force participation of older people (schofield et al. 2017). therefore, the national governments must strengthen the healthcare system to equip the workers better to meet the challenges of a rapidly rising old age population. modern technology could be beneficial to older employees if they are given lifelong training and re-training. new technologies can make job-related tasks more age-friendly (asian development bank 2018), and this facilitates the older workers to remain in and re-enter the labor market. the innovative agri-business to engage the older workers using

restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 1 3 (hashimoto 2012) can serve as a model for future technology-based employment among the older workers. whilst ageism affects both sexes, gendered ageism has become increasingly common, and women are often subjected to greater discrimination in the labor market (button 2020). because of the significant role of older female labor force participation in mitigating the inverse relationship between population aging and economic growth, older females should not be left out from the labor market. the policymakers should strive to retain this group of the population, as well as the older males in the labor market. campaigns and programs targeted to eliminate age discrimination at the workplace can go a long way to optimize the human resources of the older workers, as they possess a high level of expertise, skills, experience, and knowledge. the world health organization has developed a global campaign to combat ageism since 2016 (officer and fuente-núñez 2018), and this should be expanded to various job sectors with the local government’s assistance. the framework established by the european union in 2000 on equal treatment in employment and inclusion of laws against ageism in the workplace (united nations economic commission for europe 2019) can serve as a basis for employment-related policy planning in developing countries. all these recommendations are conditional upon the willingness and capability of the older people to remain economically active beyond the retirement age. nevertheless, as population aging is inevitable, there is a need for adequate preparation by all stakeholders before the world turns old. 7 limitations this study focused on the role of older workers in mitigating the negative relationship between population aging and economic growth and precluded an analysis of the other variables that may affect economic growth. hence, the limitation of this study is the omission of these other variables, such as social security and pension schemes as the data were country-specific, and thus a lack of comparable data. however, it is hoped that this paper will stimulate more research on the role of older workers in explaining the inter-relationship between population aging and economic development in developing countries at the national level. 8 conclusion the population of developing countries is aging rapidly. the ongoing demographic changes in developing countries due to fertility decline and increasing longevity will inevitably bring about significant implications for a country’s social and economic development in the near future. hence, this study is timely to provide some insights on the role of older workers in mitigating the negative association between population aging and economic growth in developing countries that have received little research attention. 1909 1 3 economic change and restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912 appendix 1: country classification percentage of

of aging population on growth for eq. (4) the marginal effect estimated in table 12 shows that when the older persons’ labor force participation rate is at a low level, an increase in the older population would negatively influence the economic performance, but the negative impact is mitigated by rising labor force participation of older people, regardless of the aging status. the result suggests that the baseline finding on the role of older persons’ labor force participation in mitigating the negative effect of population aging on economic growth remains robust and is not affected by the aging status. equation (4) is reproduced as below to show the computation of marginal effect for countries with less than 7% of older people and countries with at least 7% of older people: for countries with less than 7% of older
