september 2017 received in revised form 31 december 2017 accepted 2 january 2018 available online boron is a key element for some biological processes,but it becomes toxic for humans and plants in concentrations above a few ppm. we have design a new approach for boron scavenging, based in hybrid membranes of functional mesoporous silica nanoparticles immobilized in cellulose acetate. the mesoporous silica nanoparticles, with diameters around 150 nm, were functionalized with vicinal diol groups that complex boron very efficiently. the functional nanoparticles were covalently

that the boron concentration in water for human consumption is below 2.4 ppm [1,2]. european union legislation establishes 1.0 ppm as the maximum permissible value for boron [3], and in some cases it is desirable that irrigation water has boron content below 0.5 ppm, namely for the most sensitive crops, such as lemon [4]. high levels of boron inwater is usually harmful to living organisms. in humans, it affects the reproductive, cardiovascular and nervous systems, the kidneys, liver and gastrointestinal tract. in plants, it may retard the photosynthesis and therefore affect the plant's growth and productivity [5,6]. high boron contents inwater occur naturally, fromleaching of rocks and soils containing borates and borosilicates. however, the most common sources are from anthropogenic origin, mainly wastewaters from industries such as glass and ceramics, fertilizers, pesticides, soaps and detergents, semiconductors, military armors, flame retardants, pharmaceutical drugsmanufacturing, aswell as agricultural and urban activities [1,2,7]. themain formof boron inwater is boric acid, b(oh)3, and its conjugated base, tetrahydroxyborate ion, [b(oh)4]−, depending on the ph [8]. however, in industrial effluents other forms of boron may also appear, like boronic acids, e.g. phenylboronic acid, phb(oh)2. boronic acids are the preferred form of boron in suzuki-miyaura reactions for the formation of c\\c bonds. these reactions are often used in the pharmaceutical industry [9,10]. in aqueous media, boric acid, boronic acids and their conjugated bases form anionic complexes with vicinal diols, –ch(oh)–ch(oh)– [9,11,12], more efficiently at moderately alkaline ph (ph ≈ 9). these complexes are the basis of most techniques used to remove boron from wastewater, like electrodialysis, membrane filtration, precipitation- coagulation, evaporation-crystallization processes, reverse osmosis and adsorption [13]. of these methods, electrodialysis and other electrochemical techniques are effective but energy demanding [14,15].membrane filtration methods are efficient and selective but require complex and expensive equipment [14,16]. precipitation-coagulation methods have low efficiencies and lack specificity for boron removal [17,18]. reverse osmosis (ro) is very efficient to remove ions in wastewater, but for boric or boronic acids removal shows lower yields due to the reduced ionization of boronic species at neutral ph [14,16,19]. some strategies can be used to circumvent this problem, such as changing thewater ph to 9, using seawater ro membranes or denser membranes, combining romembranes with nanofiltration [20], using thin film nanocomposite (tfn) membranes [21], and combining ro membranes and boron adsorption compounds, like gac (granular activated carbon), iron (iii) hydroxides [13] or polyols [22]. however, these strategies still have problems, such as membrane corrosion at theworking ph necessary for boron scavenging or high energy consumption [23,24,25]. adsorption techniques are an alternative to the previous methods. these techniques present important design advantages over other methods, such as high versatility due to the variety of sorbents that can be used, allowing the separation of different pollutants. additionally, they are also conceptually easier to scale up for larger scale operation. most published adsorption-based boron removing systems are based on resins [26–27,28,29,30,31,32,33], including polymer matrices [26,27] and ion-exchange resins [33] or mesoporous silica [18,34–35, 36,37,38]. other adsorbents include ashes [39], activated carbon [40], clay minerals [41], metal oxides [42], and sugar derivatives such as sorbitol [43], mannitol [20], d-methyl glucamine [44], or dgluconoamidoethyl immobilized in polymer nanoparticles [45]. the main drawbacks of these adsorbents are the high cost associated with the boron removal process or the material itself [13,20]. in the case of columns (static method) the process requires heavy equipment and the regeneration can be hard. on the other hand, if the materials are used in dispersion (dynamic method), the removal is an additional operation step. moreover, if the active removal moiety is a sugar derivative, the synthesis can be very challenging. herein, we present a new and simple system for water boron scavenging based on membrane filtration with immobilized mesoporous material functionalized with boron chelating groups. mesoporous materials based on mcm-41 are composed by amorphous mesoporous silica, with high surface area (n700 m2/g) and pore volume (n1 cm3/g), and tunable porewidth. they can be prepared froma sol-gel procedure using a surfactant as template (typically a quaternary ammonium base) [46,47]. the typical applications of these materials are in catalysis and adsorption, however, the particle size of mcm-41 materials is very large (in the μm range) which hinders their use in applications that require fast mass transfer and good size homogeneity in the finalmaterials. the synthesis process can be changed (different temperatures, reactants concentrations, ph) to reduce the particle size to values below 200 nm. thesemesoporous silica nanoparticles (msns) are very versatilematerials,which can be selectively functionalized at the internal and external surfaces, and are able to incorporate different atoms and molecules in the silica network, and also accommodatemolecules or even polymers in the pore volume [48]. here,we functionalize the msns surfacewith vicinal diols groups for boron removal. the msns were covalently immobilized in a cellulose acetate membrane using a crosslinking agent. the performance of the final hybrid membrane in the water boron scavenging process was optimized for the diol content and the crosslinking density. these hybrid active membranes open the opportunity to design versatile and low cost continuous removal systems of simple preparation, implementation an operation. 2. experimental 2.1. materials tetraethoxysilane (teos, sigma, 99%), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab, sigma, 99 + %), sodium hydroxide (naoh, eka, p.a. pellets), absolute ethanol (sigma-aldrich, 99.8%), 3- glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (gopts, sigma-aldrich, ≥98%), poly(dimethylsiloxane), bis(triethoxysilyl) terminated (abcr gmbh&co), 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene hydrate (tci, n95%), phenylboronic acid (pba, fluka, 97%), ammonium hydroxide (nh4oh 25%, fluka), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (edta, riedel-de haën, 99%) and hydrochloric acid (hcl 37%, sigma-aldrich) were used as received. deionized water from a millipore system (milli-q ≥ 18 mω cm) was used in all synthesis and characterization steps. whatman® cellulose acetate circle membranes (ca1, 0.2 μmpore size, 47mm) and sartorius® cellulose acetate membrane filters (ca2, 0.2 μm pore size, 13 mm diameter) were used as received. a plastic syringe holder for 13 mm membranes was used in the filtration tests. 2.2. synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (msns) mesoporous silica nanoparticles (msns) were synthesized under basic conditions using teos as silica precursor, ctab as surfactant template, naoh as catalyst and water as solvent [49]. first, 0.5 g of ctab were dissolved in 240 ml of water with vigorous stirring, in a polypropylene flask. the mixturewas in an oil bath at 80 °cwith vigorous magnetic stirring. after ctab was completely dissolved, 1.75 ml of an aqueous solution of naoh (1.7 m) were added, followed by a dropwise addition of 2.5 ml of teos. after 2 h the nanoparticles were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with a 8:2 water:ethanol solution (60,000 g, at 20 °c for 20 min each cycle), and dried in a ventilated oven at 50 °c overnight. 408 f. albertini et al. / materials and design 141 (2018) 407–413 surfactant extraction was performed by dispersing 0.5 g of dried nanoparticles in 20 ml of an ethanolic solution of hcl (0.5 m). the dispersion was kept at 40 °c with magnetic stirring for 2 h. the nanoparticles were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with absolute ethanol (60,000 g, at 20 °c for 20 min each cycle), and dried in a ventilated oven at 50 °c overnight. 2.3. functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles the functionalization ofmsnswith goptswas performed following the post-synthesis graftingmethod using dry toluene at reflux in argon atmosphere or using ethanol at 40 °c. the ratio of graftingmolecules per unit area was 40 μmol/m2, an excess to obtain a good surface coverage. the specific areaused for themsnswas 950m2/g (obtained by nitrogen sorption measurements). functionalization of msn1: 0.1 g of msns and 5 ml of dry toluene were added into a round-bottom flask and placed in an ultrasounds bath for 10 min. then, 0.839 ml of gopts were added to the mixture and the mixture was brought to reflux for 24 h, with magnetic stirring. all these steps were carried out in an argon atmosphere. functionalization of msn2: 0.35 g of msns and 17.6 ml of ethanol were added into a polypropylene flask and placed in an ultrasounds bath for 10 min. then, 2.95 ml of gopts were added to the mixture and the mixture was heated to 40 °c for 48 h, with magnetic stirring. in both cases, the nanoparticles were recovered by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol (3 × 50 ml, 41,200 g, at 20 °c for 15 min, each cycle), and dried in a ventilated oven at 50 °c overnight. to open the epoxy ring of gopts, water was added to the functionalizedmsns (10 mlofwater to 0.1 g ofmsn) and the mixturewas heated to 70 °c during 48 h, with magnetic stirring. the nanoparticles were recovered by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol (3 × 50 ml, 60,000 g, at 20 °c for 20 min each cycle), and dried in a ventilated oven at 50 °c overnight. the amount of goptsmolecules grafted on the surface ofmsnswas determined by 1h nmr (supporting information, figs. si 1–3) [50]. samples were prepared with 5 mg of functionalized nanoparticles, a known amount of 1,3,5-trioxane (ca. 0.5 mg) as internal standard and 0.5 ml of d2o/naoh (ph 13). the samples were placed in an ultrasounds bath for 30 min to destroy the nanoparticles, before performing the analysis. 2.4. films preparation films of msns were prepared over cellulose acetate membranes. membranes (ca1 and ca2) have 0.20 μm pores, with pore volumes estimated as 74% of the volume of the membrane for ca1 (supporting information, section si 2). a teflon mold was used for the film preparation. in a first batch of films for preparation conditions optimization, a mold with squared 16×16mmholeswas used (supporting information, fig. si 4). a second batch of films, to evaluate the boron removal performance, was prepared in a mold with circular orifices 13 mm in diameter (supporting information, fig. si 5). a solution of 10 wt% msns in ethanol was kept in a ultrasound bath for 1 min., and transferred to the mold dropwise using a micropipette. the film dried overnight at room temperature. poly(dimethylsiloxane), bis(triethoxysilyl) terminated dispersed in ethanol was then added for crosslinking the nanoparticles and the membranes and left drying overnight at room temperature. the films preparation data are collected in the supporting information for the preparation conditions optimization (s1, table si1) and boron removal performance (s2, table si2). 2.5. membrane performance tests to assess the residual boron in water all filtrations were performed with the membrane film in a plastic syringe holder with a diameter of 13 mm. in all cases, the ph of the initial solution was set at around 9 before the filtration, in order to promote boron complexation [51]. the fluorescence emission spectra were corrected with the value corresponding at 330 nm. for quantification, the integrals of the emission spectra were calculated and normalized to the initial solution. after each measurement, the ph of the samples was measured and in all cases it was between 8.9 and 9.1. 2.6. boron detection method in order to assess the residual boron in water, we used a previously proposed fluorimetric method based on the use of the molecule 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (l) as boron sensor [51,52]. in this method, ph was set to 9 in the presence of nh3 buffer and edta. for each sample, 0.4 ml of the solution to be analyzed were mixed together with 0.3 ml of a mixture of 0.133 m nh3 and 0.333 m edta with ph previously set at 9, and 1.5 ml of a 1.25 μm solution of the boron sensor 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene in water. the samples were then left in the dark for 4 h before performing the analysis. care was taken in order to avoid contact between the samples containing the sensor and borosilicate glass. at the end, the ph of the samples was checked, to be between 8.9 and 9.1. 2.7. characterization transmission electron microscopy (tem) imageswere obtained on a hitachi transmission electron microscope (model h-8100 with a lab6 filament)with an accelerator voltage of 200 kv. the dried nanoparticles were dispersed in ethanol. one drop of dispersion was placed on a carbon grid and dried in air before observation. the nanoparticle dimensions were determined using “image j” software. scanning electron microscopy (sem) images were obtained using a jeol sem model jsm7001f, with an accelerated voltage of 15 kv. the samples were previously covered with a chromium layer. nanoparticle tracking analysis (nta) was performed with a nanosight instrument, model lm14c. solution proton nmr were performed on a bruker avance iii 400 spectrometer (bruker biospin gmbh, rheinstetten, germany) operating at 400 mhz. fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectra were recorded on a bruker alpha instrument in the region of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 using kbr pellets. nitrogen adsorption studies were performed in a gas porosimeter (micromeritics) with accelerated surface area and porosimetry system. the specific surface area and the total pore volume were determined using the brunauer-emmett-teller (bet) isotherm, and the average mesopore diameters assessed by the bjh algorithm. x rays diffraction spectra were obtained on rigaku miniflex ii with a x rays tube of cuka (30 kv/15 ma). the ph of the solutions was measured with a bench ph/mv/°c meter ph 1000 l, phenomenal ®. the fluorescence measurements were obtained on a horiba-jobinyvon fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter. 3. results and discussion our novel strategy to harvest boron from residual water relies on cellulose acetate membrane incorporating silica mesoporous materials functionalized with boron chelating groups (fig. 1). the hybridmsnswere prepared using a modified sol-gel procedure, catalyzed by hydroxide as base, and using ctab as template [49]. the synthesis was performed at 80 °c for 2 h, and after cleaning the nanoparticles, the surfactant was removed using an acidified ethanolic solution, that disrupt the micelles structures and the ctab is removed from the pores. surfactants (and especially ionic surfactants) tend to adsorb on the silica nanoparticles surfaces, and to ensure the complete removal of the ctab, we wash the msns exhaustively with ethanol. we have prepared two batches of nanoparticles with mean diameters of (139 ± 45) nm for msn1 and (166 ± 68) nm for msn2. the tem images in fig. 2 show that, although the shape is not perfectly homogeneous, the nanoparticles present a clear mesoporous internal structure. f. albertini et al. / materials and design 141 (2018) 407–413 409 the msns were surface-functionalized with an epoxide using 3- glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (gopts). the gopts was immobilized in msn1 under toluene reflux at 125 °c, and in msn2 under ethanol reflux at 40 °c (msn-epoxide in fig. 1). after washing the nanoparticles at the end of the reaction, the epoxide ring was opened, treating the nanoparticles with water at 70 °c (msn-diols in fig. 1) [53]. the number of vicinal diols immobilized on the msns surface was obtained from 1h nmr after destroying the msns with naoh, using trioxane as internal standard and deuterated water as solvent [50]. the obtained diol modification was 1.7 diols/nm2 for msn1- diols and 0.7 diols/nm2 formsn2-diols (fig. si 1-3, supporting information). these values correspond to the functionalization of the internal and external surface area of the nanoparticles. a good coverage was obtained using either toluene (msn1-diols) or ethanol (msn2-diols), however the functionalization in ethanol has the advantage to be less expensive and a simpler alternative to the functionalization in dry toluene. the functionalized nanoparticles (msn1-diols and msn2-diols) were used as active material in the boron removal cellulose acetate (ca) membranes. the functionalization was also confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, with the typical stretching vibration bands of ch2 groups at 2890 and 2940 cm−1 present in msn-diols nanoparticles (fig. si 4, supporting information). two different ca membranes were used (pore size of 0.20 μm in both cases, sem images in fig. si 6), presenting different structures, with ca1 showing larger pores when compared to ca2. the nanoparticles were dispersed in the ca membranes, and immobilized to the cellulose through a dialkoxysilane crosslinker. the films were prepared in two steps: first, a dispersion of the hybrid msns in ethanol was spread over the ca membrane, and after drying, the crosslinker was added to the membrane, reacting with the free silanols at the silica nanoparticles surface andwith the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose. a first batch of membraneswas preparewith non-functionalized nanoparticles, to optimize the membrane preparation conditions (table si1, supporting information). the visual aspect of the films is homogeneous without any apparent excess of nanoparticles (fig. si7, supporting information). the films were characterized by sem from the central part of the samples (fig. 3 and figs. si 8–16, supporting information). fig. 1. schematic illustration of the preparation of hybrid msns. fig. 2. tem images of nanoparticles msn1 (a and b) and msn2 (c and d). fig. 3. sem images of membranes s1-1 (a), s1-2 (b), s1-3 (c), s1-4 in top view (d) and lateral view (e), s1-6 (f), s1-7 (g), s1-8 (h), s1-9 (i), s1-10 (j). 410 f. albertini et al. / materials and design 141 (2018) 407–413 the first samples (s1-1 to s1-4) use 5.3×10−5 g of msn1 nanoparticles per mm2 of membrane (the amount estimated to fill the pores of the membrane – supporting information), and 50 wt%, 10 wt%, 5 wt% or 1 wt%, respectively, of crosslinker (with respect to the nanoparticles weight – table si1, supporting information). the sem images of these samples show low homogeneity, cracks and an excess of nanoparticles visible in the aggregates formed (fig. 3,atod).this is especially clear from the lateral view of sample s1–4 (fig. 3e), showing the support (1), the tape (2), the ca membrane (3) and the nanoparticle film (4), where most of the nanoparticles remain on the surface of the ca membrane. to overcomethe excess of nanoparticles in the films, we reduced the msn1-diols concentration to half (s1-5 to s1-7, table si 1), but the problem persisted (fig. 3 f and g). only after a 10 times reduction in msn1 nanoparticle concentration (s1-8, s1-9 and s1-10, with 10 wt%, 5 wt% and 1 wt% of crosslinker, respectively – table si1) it was possible to obtain films with good quality and no excess of nanoparticles (s1-9 and s1-10), as shown in the sem images of fig. 3h–j. the last conditions were used to prepare films with the functionalized nanoparticles msn1-diols (s1-11 and s1-12, table si1). the sem images (fig. 4) show some aggregates on the film surface when compared with bare nanoparticles (msn1) films. although surface functionalization of the nanoparticles increases their aggregation, probably by reducing the nanoparticle colloidal stability, the quality of the membranes obtained from these particles is still acceptable for their use in boron scavenging. we also prepared films over ca2 membranes,with the samemsn1- diols concentration and crosslinker (s1-13, s1-14 and s1-15, with 5 wt%, 2 wt% and 1 wt% crosslinker respectively – table si 1). the sem images (fig. 5) show that the films have lower surface homogeneity than the films prepared on ca1 membranes. this probably reflects the different morphology of both membranes (fig. si 6, supporting information). the strategy of our approach is to use the hybrid membranes in a filter module to develop a continuous process for boron scavenging from water. although the functionalized nanoparticles are covalently immobilized to the cellulose acetate membrane, we evaluated if the water flow across the membrane could affect its integrity by filtering pure water through the hybrid membrane and analyzing the filtrate for the presence of nanoparticles. using hybrid membranes produced from different cellulose acetate membranes (ca1 and ca2) and with crosslinker contents of 1, 2 and 5 wt%, we measured the nanoparticle concentration in the filtrate by nanoparticle tracking analysis (nta), concluding that the membrane integrity depends essentially on the type of cellulose acetate support used (table 1 and fig. si 17, supporting information). themembrane with ca1 as support and 5% of crosslinker does not have any losses, andwith 1% crosslinker the value is negligible. however, with ca2 we observed losses of 1.1–2.8 wt% of nanoparticles (fig. si 17, supporting information). these values indicate that the immobilization of the nanoparticles to the cellulose acetate membrane is more efficient in the case of ca1. this confirms the lower quality of membranes with ca2 as support (fig. 5) when compared with ca1 (figs. 3 and 4). the msns nanoparticles have typically high pore volumes (0.7– 1 cm3/g), an important parameter to applications where fast mass transfer is a requisite, as in the case of the present application. in our case, since the msns are covalently anchored to the ca membranes, the diffusion through the msns after immobilization could be affected. this effect was evaluated by measuring the pore volume using nitrogen sorption experiments (table 2 and fig. si 18, supporting information). the surface area obtained from the bet isotherms of the membranes is not comparable to the data of the bare msns (surface area 950 m2/g and pore volume 0.77 cm3/g), because in the hybrid membranes, the surface area of the ca membrane is also taken into account. however, from table 2 it is possible to observe a decrease in the surface area with the increase in crosslinker content, indicating that the mesopores of the msns become less accessible when more crosslinker is used. fig. 4.

with no mesopore volume measured for the membrane with higher amount of crosslinker, probably because when high contents of crosslinker are used, the mesopore entrance are occluded. preliminary boron scavenging tests were performed by filtering an aqueous solution of phenylboronic acid (pba) through the hybrid membranes. the boron remaining in the filtrate was determined by a fluorimetric method [51,52] as described in section 2.6. the boron removal efficiency indicates the quantity of boron removed by the membranes. the first test was performed with the hybrid nanoparticles msn2- diols in dispersion, to assess the performance of the nanoparticles before immobilization (fig. 6). the ph of the initial solution was set at a value around 9 before the filtration [51]. the fluorescence emission spectra were corrected with the emission at 330 nm. after each measurement, the ph of the samples was re-checked, and it was always in the range of 8.9 to 9.1. with themsn2-diols nanoparticles we obtained an 89% removal efficiency from a solution of 10 ppm of boron, using the same amount of nanoparticles present in the hybrid membranes. if we increase the amount of nanoparticles ten times, the boron removal efficiency increases to 93%, with the final boron concentration below 1 ppm (starting from 10 ppm), which is within the eu maximum permissible limit [3]. after storing the nanoparticles for two months, they present the same boron removal performance as fresh nanoparticles. the boron removal mechanism, in our case for phenylboronic acid, relies in the formation of phb(oh)3 − in alkalinemedia, followed by complexation of a diol groupwith displacement of two hydroxyl groups (si5 in the supporting information) [32,45]. the membranes used for the boron scavenging tests comprise different hybrid nanoparticles (msn1-diols and msn2-diols), crosslinker content and cellulose acetate membrane (table si 2). before testing the hybrid membranes (msn-diols + cellulose acetate membrane), we performed a test with the bare cellulose acetate membrane to evaluate if the membrane without active nanoparticles present some interaction with boron. the results show no boron interaction with the nonmodified membrane (the boron content was exactly the same before and after passing the boron solution by the membrane). the first membranes tested have 5 wt% (s2-1 and s2-4) and 1 wt% (s2-3 and s2-6) crosslinker content. in the case of the higher crosslinker content, we don't observe a reduction in the boron concentration (even after 10 filtration cycles). these membranes have a reduced mesopore volume available due to the dense crosslinking, and the pores are obstructed. the membranes with 1% crosslinker content show a high level of nanoparticles leaching (table 1), due to the higher ph of the solution (around 9), when compared with the leaching tests with pure water (table 1, ph around 6). these results motivated us to prepare membranes with 2% crosslinker content to increase the robustness of the hybridmembrane,without compromising themsn-diolsmesopore volume. we prepare membranes with both ca membrane support (s2- 2 and s2-5, table si 2). these newmembranes don't showany nanoparticles losses after 10 filtration cycles. in both cases, after one filtration cycle, we observe a decrease of up to 70% relative to the initial boron concentration. an increase in the number of cycles doesn't decrease the boron removal efficiency. the membranes present a good stability over time,with similar boron removal efficiency after twomonths storage, when compared with fresh membranes. our preliminary results show good prospects for the use of the hybrid membranes in boron scavageng from water. the membranes showgood robustness and can be used in modules composed of several membranes to achieve higher boron removal efficiencies. 4. conclusions we prepared novel hybrid membranes for boron removal from water, based on functional mesoporous silica nanoparticles immobilized in cellulose acetate supports. themesoporous silica nanoparticles, with diameter around 150 nm, were functionalized with vicinal diols that interact efficiently with boron. these functional mesoporous silica nanoparticles were covalently immobilized into cellulose acetatemembranes, using a terminal di-alkoxysilane crosslinker. the crosslinker reacts with the silanol groups remaining at the surface of the silica nanoparticles and with the free hydroxyl groups of the cellulose. the hybrid membranes present a homogeneous distribution of the nanoparticles, after optimization of the nanoparticles concentration and crosslinker content. the boron scavenging capability of the newmaterials was evaluated with a solution of phenylboronic acid. the hybrid nanoparticles in dispersion were able to remove up to 93% of the initial boron content, and the hybrid membranes reduce the boron concentration to 70% of its initial value in a single filtration step. the novel boron-chelating membranes offer good prospects for the development of easy and inexpensive boron scavenging technology, using multistage membranes modules in continuous operation. this boron removal process present important design advantages, in particular, the conceptually easy scale up, with simple preparation, implementation an operation. acknowledgements this

org/10.1016/j.matdes.2018.01.001. fig. 6. fluorescence emission spectra of the sensor l (0.9 μm) in the presence of the pba remaining in water after scavenging experiments with msn2-diols. the solid curve corresponds to fluorescence emission spectrum of the sensor in the presence of the initial pba concentration in water (10 ppm of boron). the dotted (the same amount of nanoparticles that is present in the hybrid membrane) and dashed (10 times the concentration of nanoparticles than is present in the membrane) curves correspond to the fluorescence emission spectrum of the sensor in the filtrate after being in contact with the nanoparticles. the spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength λexc = 310 nm in ammonia buffer (18 mm) at ph = 9, in the presence of edta (45 mm) at 20
