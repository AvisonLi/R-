are facing unprecedented challenges related to climate change and population aging. the purpose of the analysis is to explore the relationship between population aging and environmental degradation, accounting for human capital, using a sample of 19 oecd countries over the period 1980–2019. design/methodology/approach – on the empirical methodology, the analysis uses panel estimators with heterogenous coefficients and an error structure that takes into consideration cross-country heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence for a panel of 19 oecd countries over the period 1980–2019. to examine the relationship between population aging and environmental degradation, the authors employ two alternative measures of environmental degradation that is energy consumption and co2 emissions in metric tons per capita. concerning the regressors, the authors account for two alternative aging indicators, namely the elderly population and the old-age dependency ratios to confirm robustness. findings – the analysis provides evidence that population aging and human capital development (ihc) lead to lower energy consumption in the oecd sample. overall, the growing number of elderly people in the oecd seems to act as a mitigating factor for energy consumption. the authors view these results as conveying the message that the evolution of population aging along with channeling government expenditures towards human capital enhancement are important drivers of curbing energy consumption and ensuring environmental sustainability. the authors’ research is of great significance for environmental policymakers by illuminating the favorable energy consumption patterns that population aging brings to advanced economies. research limitations/implications – the main limitation of this study concerns data availability. future research, and subject to greater data availability in the future, could dig deeper into understanding the dynamics of this complex nexus by incorporating additional control variables. similarly, the authors focus on aggregate renewable energy consumption, and the authors do not explicitly model the sources of renewable energy (wind, hydropower, solar power, solid biofuels and other). additional analysis of the breakdown of renewable energy sourceswould be insightful – subject to data availability – especially formeeting the recently agreed new target of 42.5% for european union (eu) countries by 2030. a deep transformation of the european energy system is needed for the eu tomeet the target. finally, extending the model to include a range of non-oecd countries that are also experiencing demographic transformations is a promising avenue for future research. originality/value – to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects of population aging and human capital on environmental degradation using a broad set of oecd countries and advanced spectrumestimationmethods. given cross-sectional dependencies and cross-country heterogeneity, the authors’ empirical results underline the importance of cross-oecd policy spillovers and knowledge diffusions across the oecd countries. the new “energy culture” calls for concerted policy action even in an aging era. keywords demographic trends, population aging, human capital, energy consumption, oecd, panel regression estimation paper type

is beyond any doubt that energy is fundamental in our modern societies for both households and enterprises. however, the world is facing a severe climate emergency. bold action is needed to address climate change risks and meet the goals of the paris agreement to reach zero-net emissions by 2025. to achieve this, we need to alter our conventional way of thinking about energy and, ultimately, minimize our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy. this feeling is also shared by the latest united nations environment programme annual report (unep, 2022). concurrently, population aging is at the heart of modern economies and may have an impact on energy consumption and the emissions level. according to the world health organization (who), the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% between 2015 and 2050 (who, 2022). such a shift in the distribution of a country’s population towards older ages is more prominent in advanced economies but developing countries are now experiencing a similar change. at this unique confluence of risks, the notion of human capital takes centre stage. while the debate on what lessons does this era offer for policymakers is still open, it is clear that human capital development (ihc) has an important role to play in enhancing a proper understanding of the demographic patterns and drivers of environmental degradation. nonetheless, we know very little about the linkages among demographic, educational, economic and environmental variables. our paper aims to fill this gap. in most recent empirical analyses, uncovering the relevant drivers of climate change mitigation remains one of the most controversial and urgent issues. as to whether population aging can lead to lower energy consumption, many authors have put forth different views (estiri and zagheni, 2019; pais-magalh~aes et al., 2020, 2022; yaziz et al., 2022). still, the challenge of population aging on economic degradation remains unclear. from one standpoint, studies suggest that aging can enhance carbon emission and therefore contribute to environmental degradation as the elderly tend to have consumed more energy intensive goods and services. however, other studies point out to a negative effect of the elderly on energy consumption as they tend to be more environmentally friendly (yang and wang, 2020). recently, the effect of human capital enhancement on combatting environmental degradation is examined (opoku et al., 2022; shahbaz et al., 2022). the relationship between human capital and environmental degradation points to a negative relationship as societies with more human capital tend to be more environmentally cautious consuming less energy (hondroyiannis et al., 2022). still, little is known about the impact of population aging on energy consumption and carbon emissions controlling for human capital accumulation. ignoring this impact remains an important drawback in empirical literature. our paper contributes to empirical literature by exploring the relationship between population aging and environmental degradation, accounting for human capital, with the use of a sample of 19 oecd countries over the period 1980–2019. in other words, we move beyond the extant focus of empirical analysis to account for currently pressing issues for policymakers. to shed further light on this relationship, we employ two alternative measures of environmental degradation that is energy consumption and co2 emissions in metric tons per capita. concerning the regressors and further to the impact of human capital, we account for two alternative aging indicators, namely the elderly population and the old-age dependency ratios to confirm robustness. our data along with a novel empirical approach to studying this link, allows us to make use of panel estimators with heterogenous coefficients and an error structure that takes into consideration cross-country heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. this offers a new tool for accounting for the presence of various sources of heterogeneity among countries (the oecd is composed of an heterogeneous group of countries), such as cross-country variations in economic structures jes 51,2 472 and governance, as well as potential common effects among countries, such as advances in research and development programs, human capital expenditures, retirement policies, advances in energy saving methods, that are considered by introducing non-zero error variances in the panel estimation. to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the effects of population aging and human capital on environmental degradation using a broad set of oecd countries and advanced spectrum estimation methods, leading us to clarify how several potential explanatory factors impact on environmental degradation. to get a flavor of the empirical findings of our analysis we provide evidence that population aging and ihc lead to lower energy consumption in the oecd sample. we view these results as conveying the message that the evolution of population aging along with channeling government expenditures towards human capital enhancement are important drivers of curbing energy consumption and ensuring environmental sustainability. our findings extend our understanding on the role of population aging in preventing environmental degradation and remain robust to sensitivity checks. at the same time, our modeling approach allows us to control for ihc and connect results from the aging/human capital literature with the recently flourishing literature on climate change and environmental sustainability. the remainder of this analysis is organized as follows: section 2 presents the theoretical and empirical evidence on the effects of population aging and human capital on sustainable development. section 3 presents the methodology and describes the data. section 4 presents the empirical results. section 5 concludes. 2. population aging, human capital and sustainable development: a brief literature review the role of population aging on macroeconomic outcomes, such as inflation, output, labor force participation, is only until recently that has been studied extensively (papapetrou and tsalaporta, 2020). however, the effect of population aging on carbon emissions and in particular environmental degradation has not been studied considerably and the research outcome remains inconclusive. the impact of population aging on economic degradation remains incomplete and some studies support the notion of a positive influence on carbon emissions and others point out to a negative impact (yang and wang, 2020; yang et al., 2021). the basic idea behind the positive influence of population aging on economic degradation stems from the fact that elderly people tend to consume more energy intensive goods and services thus triggering higher level of carbon emissions. at the same time, an aging population combined with a declining share of youths tend to raise the pressure on environmental degradation. on the other hand, elderly tend to adopt consumption and income styles and patterns that support pro-environment actions that are favoring a low-carbon model and thus fostering lower environmental footprints. studies accounting for population aging have used different population indicators (zhang and tan, 2016; yang et al., 2021). one strand of literature focuses on population growth (knapp and mookerjee, 1996). the study utilizing a cointegration framework examined the nexus between global population growth and co2 emissions to support a short-term dynamic relationship between them. other studies combine population age-structures and cohort effects to examine their impact on carbon emissions (menz and welsch, 2012; zhang and tan, 2016). the analysis provides evidence of a positive impact on aging population on carbon emissions. zhang and tan (2016) account for a pool of disaggregated population factors, such as population intensity, population growth, population quality and population age-structure to examine their effect on carbon emissions in china provinces over the period 1997–2012. population aging and environmental degradation 473 many studies have documented that the impact of population aging on carbon emissions is related to the state of development of the examined countries. in a seminal work, shi (2003) using a pool of 93 countries over the period 1975–1996 shows that population’s change is more than proportionally related with rising carbon emissions, and this effect is more significant in developing countries than in developed countries. menz and welsch (2012) employing a panel of 26 countries over the period 1060–2005 and including in the estimation age (life cycle) and cohort composition effects suggest that both life cycle and cohort outcomes have positively affected carbon emissions in oecd countries. zhang and tan (2016) utilized population factors to account for their effect on carbon emission at the national and regional levels. their analysis reveals a positive effect of population aging and population quality on carbon emissions at the national level whereas there exist differences at the urban-rural level and at the regional level. recently, wang and wang (2021) using data from 2002 to 2012 for 137 countries or regions examine the nonlinear effects of population aging on carbon emissions. they employ panel threshold regression methodology and show that an increase in the level of population aging, the industrial structure and urbanization results in higher levels of carbon emissions but the findings are sensitive to the countries under different levels of development. as for the relationship between population aging, human capital and carbon emissions, four models have been utilized in the environmental literature to examine the nexus between population aging, human capital and energy consumption (menz and welsch, 2012; yang et al., 2021; hondroyiannis et al., 2022). the environmental kuznets curve (ekc) hypothesis (grossman and krueger, 1991) suggests that there is an inverted u-shaped association between output and environmental degradation in the form of energy consumption and/or co2 emissions. this suggests that as the country advances, environmental expansion reverses co2 emissions that are high in the early faces of economic development. the pollution heaven hypothesis (phh) links environmental deterioration and openness in the environmental literature. the phh suggests policies adopted by international companies initially point to low cost options in terms of resources and labor input that results in a of environmental quality. the pollution halo hypothesis suggests that companies from advanced countries by implementing environmentally friendly production processes and following eco-friendly environmental framework can result in reductions of co2 emissions in the host country. lastly, in line with the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology (stirpat) model basis it is population, affluence and technology that impose an environmental footprint on the economy. in that framework, many researchers have identified of a negative relationship between human capital and energy consumption. the evidence is ample for studies using micro data (broadstock et al., 2016; steenblik, 2006; salim et al., 2017). broadstock et al. (2016) and steenblik (2006) show that households with higher human capital in china are more energyefficient consuming less energy as they have access to more efficient technologies. employing chinese provincial data over the period 1990–2021 salim et al. (2017) found a negative association among human capital and energy consumption and have attributed this finding to post-school human capital. however, at an aggregate-macro level the relationship between human capital, energy consumption and co2 emissions is not unanimous. a plausible explanation is that human capital as it produces growth-enhancing effects in the economy may increase energy consumption, but on the other hand may result in energy preservation effects. in this manner, huang et al. (2008) document an inverse relationship between human capital and energy consumption for high income countries and a positive relationship for low-income countries for a panel of 82 countries from 1972 to 2002. for a panel of asian pacific countries for 1970– 2011 and employing a human capital index as measured by the years of schooling fang and chang (2016) support the presence of a long-run relationship among economic growth, jes 51,2 474 human capital and energy consumption. they justify their findings as they suggest that strengthening human capital investment supports the research and development of new energy-efficient technologies. yao et al. (2019) account for clean and dirty energy consumption for a panel of oecd countries over the period 1965–2014 to find that human capital decreases dirty energy consumption and increases clean energy consumption after controlling for energy prices, capital, research and development and labor market institutions. also, yao et al. (2020) using data for a panel of 20 oecd counties over an 1870–2014 find that human capital is associated with reductions in co2 emissions. hondroyiannis et al. (2022) using data for 19 oecd countries with advance expenditures in education show that human capital advancement is robustly associated with reduction in co2 emissions, a finding that is robust across the energy consumption distribution. opoku et al. (2022) use data for oecd countries over the period 1996–2016 to examine the impact of human development on environmental degradation and show that progress in human development ensures environmental sustainability. recently, chondrogianni and tsalaporta (2023) using a data from 14 developing countries with a large share of carbon emissions over the period 1980–2019 examine the role of human capital on mitigating environmental deterioration. the results show that human capital progress is strongly associated with reductions in co2 emissions. despite of the richness of empirical approaches on accounting for the effects of population aging or human capital on environmental degradation, to the best of our knowledge, the relationship between population aging on economic degradation accounting for human capital has been overlooked in the literature. our paper contributes to this shortcoming by deriving policy prescriptions in the presence of such a relationship. 3. methodology and data 3.1 empirical model our panel consists of 19 oecd countries, over the period 1980–2019, based on data availability. the selected country group not only stands out for the level of human capital and the environmental consciousness but is also characterized by a rise in the share of the older people mainly resulting from longer life expectancy [1]. demographic developments and human capital advancement can both play a key role in averting environmental degradation. the sample countries, with an aging population, higher human capital and greater environmental awareness achieve better environmental outcomes (yang et al., 2021; alvarado et al., 2021). we employ two variables as proxies for environmental degradation, energy consumption and co2 emissions, to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between population aging, human capital and sustainable development. government expenditure per student (as percentage of gross domestic product (gdp) per capita) is used as proxy for human capital to provide an in-depth look at the muchneeded climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in the oecd. following the aforementioned empirical strategy and a combination of theories, i.e. the ekc and phh hypotheses and new growth theories and a set of control variables that account for omitted variable bias, our model is specified as follows: energyit ¼ a1 þ β1ageit þ β2hcit þ β3gdprealitþβ4oilpriceit þ β5openit þ uit (1) co2emit ¼ a1 þ β1ageit þ β2hcit þ β3gdprealitþβ4oilpriceit þ β5openit þ uit (2) where ageit captures either the elderly ratio (elderlyit) or the old-age dependency ratio (oldageit) of country i at time t and βi denote coefficients to be estimated. hcit is the human capital index, gdprealit is gdp per capita, oilpriceit denotes crude oil import prices, openit is the economic openness measure and uit is the error term. all variables enter the regressions in logarithmic population aging and environmental degradation 475 form. it is assumed that the regressors are uncorrelated with the disturbance term uit. however, the disturbances themselves are allowed to be autocorrelated, heteroskedastic and cross-sectionally dependent. all variables used in equations (1) and (2) are explained below. 3.2 econometric methodology using advanced spectrum estimation methods, we estimate equations (1) and (2) to explore the relationship between population aging, human capital and environmental degradation. building on traditional fixed effects (fe) panel estimators, we go one step further and allow the slope coefficients to differ across panel members by using the mean group (mg) estimator that implements a panel time-series estimator, allowing for heterogeneous slope coefficients across group members and cross-sectional dependence (eberhardt, 2012). to estimate effects in a large heterogeneous panel data model with cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity, we employ the newly developed (dynamic) common correlated effects model (dcce) proposed by ditzen (2019). this works satisfactorily for static and dynamic models. the variances are calculated using the delta method. in contrast to the mg estimation, dcce partials out the crosssectional means internally to account for dependencies between units. the cross-sectional means approximate the unobserved common factors between units. on top of the inclusion of the cross-sectional averages, there is another important difference; mg calculates the coefficients using maximum likelihood while dcce estimates our equation entirely by ordinary least squares (ols) using common correlated effects. this recently developed econometric approach upgrades statistical inference in the estimation of heterogeneous coefficient models in panels with a large number of observations over country groups and time periods, as is the case in our model. 3.3 data the dataset covers annual frequency data for a panel of 19 advanced countries from 1980 to 2019, based on data availability. variables employed in the analysis are sourced from the world bank world development indicators (wdi) and the oecd databases. all variables are in logarithmic form. variables expressed in natural logarithms are denoted by l in the regression output. dependent variables include the following indicators: energy consumption is measured as energy use in kg of oil equivalent per capita (energy) and proxies for overall environmental pollution in a country. an alternative measure of environmental degradation is co2 emissions in metric tons per capita (co2em). carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. they include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid and gas fuels and gas flaring. monitoring and mitigating carbon emissions is one of the key aspects of the paris agreement on climate change. independent variables cover a broad set of policy areas and include the following indicators: the elderly population is defined as people aged 65 and over (elderly) measured as a percentage of population. it is a key variable in the analysis. a higher elderly ratio is expected to be negatively associated with energy consumption. another demographic indicator employed in the analysis is the old-age dependency ratio (oldage) that is defined as the number of individuals aged 65 and over per 100 people of working age defined as those at ages 20 to 64. the evolution of old-age to working-age ratios depends on mortality rates, fertility rates and migration. turning to human capital variables, the human capital index (hc) is based on government expenditure per student, tertiary (% of gdp per capita) and is expected to be negatively associated with energy consumption and co2 emissions. the choice of this variable offers a better insight into the role of policy making in promoting sustainable development. gdp per capita as constant 2010 us dollars (gdpreal) is employed as a proxy for income effects. growing per jes 51,2 476 capita gdp will most likely lead to increasing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. to account for energy price developments, we employ crude oil import prices (oil). crude oil import prices come from the international energy agency (iea)’s crude oil import register and are influenced not only by traditional movements of supply and demand, but also by other factors such as geopolitics. information is collected from national agencies according to the type of crude oil, by geographic origin and by quality of crude. values are recorded at the time of import and include cost, insurance and freight, but exclude import duties. this indicator is measured in usd per barrel of oil. it is expected to be negatively associated with energy consumption and carbon emissions. we also control for economic openness measure (open). calculated as the sum of exports (exports) and imports (imports) of goods and services as a percentage of gdp, economic openness is a key indicator of a country’s integration into the world economy. it is expected to lead to a decrease in energy demand by enabling countries to import advanced energy supply technologies, which could eventually lower energy intensity. table 1 reports the summary statistics for the dependent and independent variables employed in the analysis. 4. empirical results 4.1 preliminary tests in this section, various specification tests are employed to verify that the empirical model is correctly specified, taking into consideration the sample of 19oecdcountries. first, to estimate the impact of human capital on environmental degradation, we begin by employing the pesaran’s cross-sectional dependence (cd) test to examine the existence of cross-sectional dependence in the panel due to increasing integration of countries and to strong interdependencies among them (de hoyos and sarafidis, 2006). disregarding the existence of sufficient cross-sectional dependence in the data that is ignored in the estimation,may well lead to estimation biases. the pesaran cd-test shows that the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence is rejected as, on average, the (absolute) correlation between the residuals of oecdcountries is 0.526 formodel ia, 0.515 formodel ib, 0.445 formodel iia and 0.447 for model iib (table 2). model ia denotes specifications where energy consumption is the dependent variable obs mean std. dev min max equation (1)* energy 660

specifications where co2 emissions is the dependent variable and the elderly ratio is employed as a control variable. model iib denotes specifications where co2 emissions is the dependent variable and

similar results as those of the pesaran’s cd test. the existence of cross-sectional dependence is confirmed. to choose the model that best fits in the sample, as a second step, we employ the slope homogeneity test of pesaran and yamagata (2008) to check whether heterogeneity exists across countries for the analyzed dataset. using monte carlo experiments, the adjusted (delta-adjusted: δadj) version of the dispersion test has the correct size and satisfactory power in panels with exogenous regressors for various combinations of n and t, irrespective of whether the errors are normally distributed or not. the results of the slope homogeneity test, as shown in table 2 (delta and delta-adjusted), show that the delta test statistic is sufficiently large to reject the null of slope homogeneity, pointing to the heterogeneity of the slope coefficients. third, having verified that the data are cross-sectionally dependent and slope coefficients are heterogeneous, we run the cross-sectional augmented dickey-fuller second-generation unit root test proposed by pesaran (2007) in the context of heterogeneous panels with crosssectional dependence and slope heterogeneity (pescadf test). results generally indicate evidence against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. the pescadf tests ensures that the series are stationary (table 3). value p-value average absolute

preliminary tests’ results, we estimate the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables using the most recently developed estimation methods. table 4 presents the average (mean) energy consumption (model i) (columns 1, 3, 5 and 7) and co2 emissions coefficients (model ii) (columns 2, 4, 6 and 8) under mg (columns 1–4) and dcce estimators (columns 5–8) for panel data. the mg estimates overcome the presence of slope heterogeneity in large panels. the dcce estimates account not only for slope heterogeneity but also for cross-sectional dependence. under the dcce estimator, we partial out the cross-sectional averages of the dependent variables (energy consumption and co2 emissions) internally to account for dependencies between countries manifesting as unobserved common factors. to ensure robustness, we employ two alternative aging indicators, that is the elderly population (lelderly) and the old-age dependency ratios (loldage). results show that population aging mitigates environmental degradation. other studies have also confirmed this view (yang et al., 2021; yaziz et al., 2022). we observe this pattern irrespective of the aging indicator employed as a control variable. the increase in the elderly population (lelderly) and in the old-age dependency ratio (loldage) have a noticeable negative effect on energy consumption (lenergy) (columns 1, 3, 5 and 7), a finding which is consistent over different estimation methods. their impact on co2 emissions (lco2em) is statistically significant though solely under themgestimator (columns 2 and 4). the main reason for that is the energy consumption patterns of the elderly which tend to be more low-carbon and environmentally friendly than the younger generations. in particular, the elderly tend to use less electricity due to decreased reliance on energy consuming home appliances (such as washing machines, fridges, consumer electronics, kitchen appliances) relative to their younger counterparts. older people tend to make less use of private vehicles and planes which are major polluters and generate the most direct emissions. habit formation matters as well as the size of the household. older households are typically smaller households (with fewer members). therefore, older households are generally expected to cause less environmental pollution in the long run as they consume less energy overall. taking a different angle, the robustly negative association between population aging and environmental degradation (especially in terms of energy consumption) might stem from greater investment in renewable energy technologies. acemoglu and restrepo (2017) show that countries undergoing faster aging have grown more in recent decades owing to a more rapid adoption of automation technologies. empirical estimates also reveal that lhc reduces energy consumption (lenergy), as demonstrated in hondroyiannis et al. (2022). related literature (khan et al., 2020) confirms the negative effect of human capital and eco-innovation on both non-renewable and total energy consumption in g-7 countries. interestingly, the

source(s): authors’ own creation/work table 4. population aging, human capital, energy consumption and co2 emissions jes 51,2 480 become considerably larger in magnitude under the mg estimator (columns 1 and 3) compared to results from the dcce estimator (columns 5 and 7). however, there is a lack of robust evidence on the link between human capital (lhc) and co2 emissions (lco2em). the negative impact of human capital on energy consumption portrays that education, manifesting – among others – as greater environmental awareness, can play a vital role in averting environmental degradation. along these lines, climate-conscious consumers exert pressure on regulators to take action to protect the environment (herweg and schmidt, 2022). oil prices (loil) have a negative and statistically significant effect on energy consumption (lenergy), which likely reflects the fact that higher oil prices decrease the demand for energy and reduce high-carbon energy consumption. consistent with this interpretation, and in line with the existing studies which document that higher energy prices promote clean energy consumption (yao et al., 2019), we find that oil prices (loil) are negatively associated with energy consumption (lenergy) solely under the mg estimates (columns 1 and 3). in contrast, the nexus between oil prices and co2 emissions is negligible except for column 4 which documents a robustly negative impact of high oil prices (loil) on carbon emissions (lco2em). empirical outcomes disclose that economic growth (lgdpreal) is positively associated with energy consumption (lenergy) and co2 emissions (lco2em), especially under the mg estimator (columns 1–5). from the economic perspective, increasing income spurs the demand for energy consumption and enhances carbon emissions due to lifestyle trends of the wealthy such as high levels of car ownership, high domestic usage due to a large assortment of appliances and high industry concentration in wealthier regions (shahbaz et al., 2022; yaziz et al., 2022). economic openness (lopen) does not appear to have a statistically significant effect on the dependent variables in our sample, although the point estimates are negative, suggesting that higher openness would depress energy consumption (lenergy) and co2 emissions (lco2em). overall, population aging – as reflected in higher elderly ratio (lelderly) and old-age dependency ratio (loldage) – is an important channel for curbing energy consumption (lenergy) in the oecd sample. empirical estimates for lhc paint a similar picture. the other control variables do not have a clear impact on the set of dependent variables. economic growth (lgdpreal) increases energy consumption (lenergy) and co2 emissions (lco2em), but this effect is not statistically significant across all specifications. at the same time, empirical evidence for oil prices (loil) is rather mixed. 5. conclusions the oecd countries are facing unprecedented challenges related to climate change and population aging. the urgent need to avert environmental degradation amid an aging population has raised significant economic and environmental concerns in academic research and policymaking. the notion of human capital, including – among others – elements of environmental literacy, plays a central role for economic inference. considering its importance, many studies have been carried out on this topic. however, none of the existing studies has focused on the nexus between population aging and environmental degradation accounting for human capital in the presence of cross-country heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence, as is the case in our model. to fill this gap, we make several important contributions to the extant literature. first, we shed light on the joint impact of population aging on environmental degradation in the oecd over the period 1980–2019 accounting for human capital, an issue relatively unexplored. second, apart from having a different focus, our study differs in terms of the empirical methodology. our approach offers significant advantages in terms of accounting for cross-country heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependencies among the oecd sample countries. third, our paper differs in that we move beyond existing papers by controlling for population aging and environmental degradation 481 a rich set of alternative measures of the dependent and independent variables, a crucial issue for ensuring the robustness of the outcomes. one of the main findings of our paper is that population aging is robustly associated with reductions in energy consumption and co2 emissions under the mg panel estimator. results provide evidence that countries with a relatively higher share of elderly citizens are more inclined to a lower level of energy consumption and tend to emit fewer emissions. however, this study provides a mixed picture on the impact of population aging on carbon emissions under the most recently developed dynamic common correlated effects (dcce) estimator. overall, the growing number of elderly people in theoecdseems to act as amitigating factor for energy consumption. our research is of great significance for environmental policymakers by illuminating the favorable energy consumption patterns that population aging brings to advanced economies. re-echoing the findings of several recent studies and moving beyond them to account for recent demographic developments, results suggest that human capital enhancement is robustly associated with reductions in energy consumption. this finding is consistent across estimation methods. one of themain reasons for this is the fact that environmentally aware citizens tend to embrace low-carbon consumption patterns and make use of environmentally friendly technologies, which helps to meet the energy efficiency targets as part of the 2050 decarbonization objectives. channeling government expenditures towards human capital development (and nurturing environmental consciousness) can be used by policymakers as a key tool in the long-term response to climate change related risks. given cross-sectional dependencies and cross-country heterogeneity, empirical results underline the importance of cross-oecd policy spillovers and knowledge diffusions across the oecd countries. the new “energy culture” calls for concerted policy action even in the presence of an aging era. importantly, the model allows us to draw inference with important societal implications in the fields of attitudes’ formation and quality of life. in particular, an increase in renewable energy use has several societal benefits such as mitigating climate change, improving health by reducing pollution associatedwith carbon emissions, improving energy security (uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price) and enhancing environmental quality. the main limitation of this study concerns data availability. future research, and subject to greater data availability in the future, could dig deeper into understanding the dynamics of this complex nexus by incorporating additional control variables. similarly, we focus on aggregate renewable energy consumption, and we do not explicitly model the sources of renewable energy (wind, hydropower, solar power, solid biofuels and other). additional analysis of the breakdown of renewable energy sources would be insightful – subject to data availability – especially for meeting the recently agreed new target of 42.5% for eu countries by 2030. a deep transformation of the european energy system is needed for the eu to meet its target. finally, extending the model to include a range of non-oecd countries that are also experiencing demographic transformations is a promising avenue for future research. note 1. the 19 advanced countries considered are as follows: australia, austria, canada, denmark, finland, france, germany, greece, ireland,
