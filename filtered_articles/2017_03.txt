however, whether rnai plays antiviral roles in mammals remains unclear. here, using human enterovirus 71 (hev71) as a model, we showed hev71 3a protein as an authentic viral suppressor of rnai during viral infection. when the 3a-mediated rnai suppression was impaired, the mutant hev71 readily triggered the production of abundant hev71-derived small rnas with canonical sirna properties in cells and mice. these virus-derived sirnas were produced from viral dsrna replicative intermediates in a dicer-dependent manner and loaded into ago, and they were fully active in degrading cognate viral rnas. recombinant hev71 deficient in 3a-mediated rnai suppression was significantly restricted in human somatic cells and mice, whereas dicer deficiency rescued hev71 infection independently of type i interferon response. thus, rnai can function as an antiviral immunity, which is induced and suppressed by a human virus, in mammals. introduction rnai is an evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in eukaryotes (carthew and sontheimer, 2009; kim et al., 2009) and has been well recognized as an innate antiviral immunity in fungi, plants, and invertebrates. in the process of antiviral rnai, viral dsrna (double-stranded rna) replicative intermediates generated during rna virus replication are recognized and processed by dicer endoribonuclease into 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) sirnas (small interfering rnas) that contain perfectly base-paired central regions with 2-nt 30 overhangs (ding, 2010). these virus-derived sirnas (also named viral sirnas) are then transferred by dicer into argonaute (ago) proteins, the core components of rna-induced silencing complex (risc), to direct the cleavage of cognate viral rnas. thus, the fundamentals of antiviral rnai immunity are as follows: (1) viral infection induces the production of virus-derived sirnas, and (2) more importantly, these virus-derived sirnas or virusinduced rnai responses have antiviral activity (cullen et al., 2013; ding, 2010). however, when small rnas in a variety of mammalian somatic cells infected by various rna viruses, including influenza a virus (iav) and picornavirus, were subjected to deep sequencing, canonical sirna species derived from viral rnas were either not detected or detected at extremely low levels with an overwhelming bias for one strand (kennedy et al., 2015; parameswaran et al., 2010; weng et al., 2014). additionally, genetic ablation of dicer or ago2, the major ago protein responsible for the sirna pathway, failed to enhance virus replication in mammalian somatic cells (bogerd et al., 2014a; kennedy et al., 2015; parameswaran et al., 2010). thus, it remains an open question whether rnai functions as an antiviral defense in mammals, particularly in differentiated mammalian somatic cells. unlike mammalian somatic cells, embryonic stem cells (escs) have been found to produce readily detectable sirnas from long dsrnas (nejepinska et al., 2012; tam et al., 2008; watanabe et al., 2008). it has been reported that murine escs (mescs) infected by encephalomyocarditis virus (emcv) produced abundant viral sirnas, although the differentiation of mescs resulted in loss of both pluripotency and viral sirna production (maillard et al., 2013). moreover, murine oocytes have been found to express an n-terminally truncated isoform of dicer that can process dsrnas into sirnas (flemr et al., 2013). recently, cullen and colleagues reported that ectopic expression of an n-terminally truncated human dicer mutant could produce readily detectable viral sirnas in iav-infected human somatic cells. however, the shorter dicer isoform is rodent specific and not naturally present in human cells (kennedy et al., 2015). therefore, mescs and probably certain germline cells, which are undifferentiated and retain some pluripotency, are intrinsically different with differentiated somatic cells in producing sirnas. interestingly, ding and colleagues found that infection by a nodamura virus (nov) mutant that does not express protein b2 triggered the production of readily detectable nov-derived sirnas in rodent somatic cell lines and suckling mice (li et al., 992 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 ª 2017 elsevier inc. figure 1. hev71 3a suppresses dicer-mediated sirna biogenesis by sequestrating dsrna in vitro (a) 293t cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding egfp (0.1 mg) and egfp-specific shrna (0.3 mg), together with either empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding hev71 nonstructural protein or nov b2 (nb2) (0.3 mg for each). cells transfected with sirna of ago2 or nc sirna (50 nm for each) were used as (legend continued on next page) immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 993 2013). however, nov is an insect virus, but not a mammalian virus that belongs to the same positive-stranded rna virus family (nodaviridae) with other insect nodaviruses such as flock house virus (fhv) and wuhan nodavirus (li et al., 2002; qi et al., 2012). most insect or plant rna viruses encode viral suppressors of rnai (vsrs) to antagonize antiviral rnai (ding, 2010). nodaviral b2 proteins are among the best-characterized vsrs and suppress antiviral rnai in insects by sequestering viral dsrnas and targeting rnai pathway component (aliyari et al., 2008; li et al., 2002; qi et al., 2012). moreover, some mammalian viral proteins, like iav ns1 and ebola virus (ebov) vp35, have been reported to suppress rnai in vitro (haasnoot et al., 2007; li et al., 2016). therefore, the identification of an authentic vsr encoded by a mammalian virus would be the key step to answering the fundamental questions: (1) can viral infection induce viral sirna production?; and (2) does virus-induced rnai have antiviral activity in mammals? enteroviruses are a genus of positive-stranded rna viruses in the family picornaviridae and include numerous important human pathogens, such as poliovirus, hev71, echoviruses, and coxsackieviruses that annually infect around 3,000,000,000 people and are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases. especially, hev71 infection in infants and young children causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (hfmd) and severe neurological manifestations and has emerged as one of the major global threats to public health. in addition, human enteroviruses are among the best-characterized rna viruses and have served as important models in the development of modern virology (shih et al., 2011). here, we first identified the nonstructural protein 3a of hev71 as the vsr that inhibits dicer-mediated sirnas biogenesis by sequestrating dsrnas. when the 3a-mediated suppression of rnai was impaired by point mutations, the vsr-deficient mutant viruses effectively triggered rnai response in both mammalian somatic cells and mice, producing abundant hev71-derived small rnas with all of the properties of canonical sirnas. these hev71-derived sirnas are dicerdependently produced from viral dsrna replicative intermediates, loaded into ago-risc, and are fully active to degrade cognate viral genomic rnas. most importantly, the vsr-deficient mutants of hev71 are significantly restricted in human somatic cells and mice, while dicer deficiency successfully restored hev71 infection independently of type i interferon (ifn-i) response. overall, our findings highlight that rnai can indeed function as antiviral immunity in mammals, and here, we showed that it is induced and suppressed by hev71. results hev71 nonstructural protein 3a is a potential vsr to determine whether hev71 encodes proteins that work as potential vsrs, we examined all hev71-encoded nonstructural proteins via a reversal-of-silencing assay. in this assay, cultured human hek293t cells were co-transfected with the plasmids encoding egfp and egfp-specific small hairpin rna (shrna), which is cleaved by dicer to produce sirna, together with vectors for hev71 nonstructural proteins. two days after transfection, egfp mrna levels were determined by northern blot (figure 1a), and the protein expression was determined by western blot (figure s1a). the egfp-specific shrna eliminated the egfp transcripts (figure 1a), confirming that the rnai is effective. we found that the expression of the 3a protein and its precursor 3ab effectively rescued the accumulation of egfp mrna, indicating that 3a is a potential vsr (figure 1a, lanes 8 and 9). in addition, ectopically expressing nov b2 or knocking down ago2 (figure s1b) expectedly inhibited the shrnainduced rnai (figure 1a, lanes 4 and 12; figure s1c). since the rnai pathway is conserved from plants to animals, we sought to determine if 3a is also able to suppress dsrnainduced rnai in insect cells. our data showed that ectopic expression of hev71 3a effectively suppressed the dsrnainduced rnai in cultured drosophila s2 cells (figure s1d, lane 5). moreover, ectopically expressing fhv b2 (fb2), another well-established vsr, or knocking down fly dicer-2 or ago2 (figure s1e) also suppressed rnai (figure s1d), as expected. to further confirm the in vitro rnai suppression activity of hev71 3a, we adopted another canonical assay in cultured s2 cells. in this assay, a vsr-deficient mutant of fhv replicon (pfr1-db2) was expressed in s2 cells. owing to a lack of b2, this mutant replicon was unable to suppress antiviral rnai, resulting in the near clearance of self-replicated fhv rna1 and rna3 in s2 cells (figure s1f, compared lanes 1 and 2). this replication defect of the vsr-deficient replicon could be partially rescued by the ectopic expression of either fhv b2 or hev71 3a (figure s1f, lanes 3 and 4) or by the knockdown of fly ago2 controls. at 48 hr after transfection, total rnas were extracted, and the level of egfp mrna was examined via northern blotting with dig-labeled rna probe targeting the egfp orf 500–720 nt. 18 s rrna was used as loading control. (b) increasing amount (0–4 mm) of mbp-fusion hev71 3a (mbp-3a) was incubated with 0.1 mm 200-nt dig-labeled dsrna at 37c for 30 min. complexes were separated on 6% native-page, transferred to membranes, and then incubated with anti-dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. for competition assays, 2 mm of mbp-3a was incubated with 0.1 mm dig-labeled dsrna and increasing amounts (0.2–5 mm) of unlabeled dsrna or ssrna. (c) 293t cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding egfp (0.1 mg) and egfp-specific shrna (0.3 mg), together with the plasmids encoding hev71 3a wt or mutants (0.3 mg for each). the egfp mrna levels were determined by qrt-pcr with that in the presence of wt 3a defined as 100%. data represent means and standard deviations (sd) of three independent experiments. cell lysates were also subjected to western blotting with anti-flag and anti-a-tubulin antibodies. (d) northern blotting of egfp mrna levels of 293t cells co-transfected with a plasmid encoding egfp and egfp-specific shrna, together with either empty plasmid or the plasmid encoding nb2, 3a, or its mutants (3ad23a and 3ar34a). (e) increasing amounts (1–16 mm) of mbp-3ad23a or mbp-3ar34a were incubated with 0.1 mm 200-nt dig-labeled dsrna at 37c for 30 min. complexes were analyzed as noted above. (f) 293t cells were co-transfected with egfp-specific shrna (0.3 mg) and either the increasing amounts (0.1–0.3 mg) of the plasmid encoding 3a or its mutants (3ad23a and 3ar34a). total rnas were subjected to northern blotting with either dig-labeled oligo rna probe targeting egfp-shrna or u6. the synthetic 21- and 25-nt rnas were used as size markers. cell lysates were also subjected to western blotting with anti-flag and anti-a-tubulin antibodies. (g) the purified proteins as indicated were incubated with 0.4 mg 200-nt dsrna together with a human recombinant dicer (0.5 u) at 37c for 16 hr. the rnas were separated on 7 m urea-15% page and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. each experiment has been repeated at least three times independently. see also figure s1. 994 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 (figure s1f, lane 5). together, these results showed that hev71 3a can block rnai in cells and is a potential vsr. hev71 3a suppresses dicer-mediated sirna biogenesis by sequestrating dsrna in vitro the 3a proteins encoded by poliovirus and coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) form a homodimer with each monomer consisting of two antiparallel a helices (strauss et al., 2003; wessels et al., 2006) (figure s1g), which is structurally similar to some vsrs such as nodaviral b2 that sequester dsrna from dicer cleavage (qi et al., 2012). to determine if hev71 3a binds to long dsrna, gel shift assays were conducted by incubating in-vitro-transcribed 200-nt digoxin (dig)-labeled dsrna with increasing concentrations of recombinant mbp-fusion 3a (mbp-3a, figure s1h). in addition, unlabeled dsrnas and ssrnas were used as competitors to further evaluate the affinities of 3a with dsrna and ssrna. the presence of 3a apparently resulted in the gel mobility shift of dig-labeled dsrna (figure 1b, lanes 3–6), and only the unlabeled dsrnas efficiently competed with dig-labeled dsrnas (figure 1b, lanes 7–9), while the ssrna competitor had a minimal effect (figure 1b, lanes 10–12). these results demonstrate that hev71 3a can bind long dsrna in vitro. to identify the critical residues responsible for dsrna-binding and rnai suppression activities of hev71 3a, we performed multiple sequence alignments of the positively charged residues of enterovirus 3as (figure s1g) and examined the single-point mutations of conserved arginine and lysine using the reversalof- silencing assay in 293t cells. in addition, because dimerization is required for vsr activities of many plant and insect viruses (qi et al., 2012), we also introduced a point mutation of asp23, located in the a2 helix of 3a, which is identical in all enteroviruses sequenced to date (figure s1g) and previously reported to be essential for 3a dimerization of poliovirus and cvb3 (strauss et al., 2003; wessels et al., 2006). our data showed that asp23 was also required for dimerization of hev71 3a (figure s1i). thus, we performed quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) to determine the effects of different mutants on egfp mrna levels and found that mutation of conserved asp23 or arg34 to alanine (d23a or r34a) substantially reduced the ability of 3a to suppress rnai (figure 1c). these results were further confirmed by northern blot (figure 1d, lanes 8 and 9). furthermore, we found that either the d23a or r34a mutation abolished dsrna-binding activity of hev71 3a (figure 1e), indicating that 3a requires long dsrna-binding activity to suppress rnai. next, we sought to determine whether hev71 3a could sequestrate dsrna from dicer cleavage in human somatic cells. small rnas were harvested from 293t cells co-expressing shrna together with 3a or its mutants and then subjected to northern blotting with a dig-labeled rna oligo probe that recognizes both the precursor shrna (pre-shrna) and mature sirna. as shown in figure 1f, the accumulation of 22-nt dicer-cleaved sirna was substantially lower in cells expressing 3a than in cells expressing empty vectors. as expected, 3ad23a and 3ar34a failed to suppress the processing of shrna into sirna (figure 1f, lanes 5–8). to further confirm the direct role of hev71 3a in protecting dsrna from dicer cleavage, we adopted an in vitro assay in which purified 200-nt dsrna, recombinant human dicer, and mbp-fusion 3a or its mutants were added. while dsrna was efficiently processed into 22-nt sirna in the presence of mbp alone, mbp-3ad23a, or mbp-3ar34a, the addition of mbp-3a protected dsrna from cleavage by dicer in a dosedependent manner (figure 1g). altogether, we conclude that hev71 3a suppresses rnai by sequestrating dsrna from dicer cleavage in vitro. hev71 3a inhibits dicer-dependent production of virus- derived sirnas in human somatic cells to investigate the vsr function of 3a in an authentic viral infection context, we introduced the d23a or r34a mutation in the 3a coding region of the infectious clone of the hev71 strain vr1432 (figure 2a). the wild-type (wt) and mutant viruses were all viable and successfully recovered in human rhabdomyosarcoma (rd) cells (figures 2b and 2c). the mutant viruses (hev71d23a and hev71r34a) showed weaker growth patterns than did the wt virus (hev71wt) in rd and 293t cells (figure 2d), suggesting that the loss of vsr function probably contributes to the restriction of hev71 replication. the presence of readily detectable viral sirnas within infected cells has been recognized as a marker of antiviral rnai (ding, 2010). to determine if hev71 infection triggers the production of viral sirnas, total rnas were extracted from 293t cells infected with hev71wt at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 at 24 hr post-infection (hpi) and then subjected to deep sequencing. abundant viral small rnas (vsrnas), 18–28 nt in length, were detected in the hev71wt-infected 293t cells (figure 3a). these vsrnas failed to cluster as predicted 22 ± 1-nt dicer products (canonical sirnas) but instead were presented as predominantly nonspecific viral rna degradation products with random size distribution and an overwhelming bias for positive strands (97.38%) (table s1), similar to those observed in mammalian somatic cells infected by poliovirus and iav (kennedy et al., 2015; parameswaran et al., 2010). besides, a previous study by weng et al. identified several hev71wt-derived vsrnas that are cleavage products from the internal ribosome entry site (ires), that vary in size, and that lack sirna properties (weng et al., 2014), consistent with our observation. next, we infected 293t cells or a characterized dicer-deficient 293t cell line (nodice), whose all three copies of the dicer1 gene are inactivated by gene editing (bogerd et al., 2014b), with hev71d23a. of note, hev71d23a was used here because the d23a mutation was more efficient than r34a in eliminating the in vitro rnai suppression activity of 3a (figure 1g) and restricting hev71 replication in cells (figure 2d). as shown in figure 3a and table s1, although vsrnas detected in hev71d23ainfected cells were less abundant than those in hev71wtinfected cells, which were likely due to the greatly reduced mutant virus genomic rna, the positive-strand bias was substantial reduced (67.89%). moreover, vsrna reads in 22 ± 1-nt size were divided approximately equally into positive (59.95%) and negative strands (40.41%), revealing apparent peaks of vsrnas of both polarities (figure 3a). further bioinformatics analysis showed that the hev71d23a library was enriched for a population of 22-nt vsrnas that contained a 20-nt perfectly base-paired duplex region with 2-nt 30 overhangs (figure 3b, peak ‘‘2’’), which were not found in the vsrnas of hev71wt (figure 3b). together, these results show that a significant level of vsrnas with the properties of canonical sirnas were immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 995 produced in 293t cells infected with hev71d23a, and this finding was also confirmed by an independently repeated experiment (figures s2a and s2b). interestingly, when dicer is deficient by gene editing, far fewer vsrna reads were detected in in nodice 293t cells infected by hev71d23a (table s1), and the remaining vsrnas did not show any of the sirna properties observed in normal 293t cells infected with the same mutant virus (figure 3a and 3b), showing that the production of canonical viral sirnas is dicer-dependent. analysis of the genomic origin of vsrna reads predicted to form sirna duplexes (22-nt size) showed that hev71d23aderived sirnas were highly concentrated at the 50 termini of the hev71 genome (73.8% of total reads in 22-nt size) in the highly structured ires (figure 3c and figure s2c). notably, 94.9% of the negative-stranded vsrna reads in 22-nt size were derived from the terminal regions of antigenomic rnas (figure 3c). these terminal vsrna reads formed successive (or phased) complementary pairs of viral sirnas (figures 3d and 3e), and none of the reversed sequences of negative-strand vsrna reads from the terminal regions could be mapped to positive-stranded hev71 genomic rna (figure 3f) even when two nucleotide mismatches were allowed, showing that negative- stranded vsrna reads were derived from antigenomic rnas produced by viral rna replication. together, our results show that the viral sirnas in hev71d23a-infected 293t cells were predominantly derived from dicer processing of the termini of viral dsrna replicative intermediates, but not viral rna stem structures. production of abundant viral sirnas in human somatic cells infected with vsr-deficient hev71 we next sought to determine whether hev71-derived sirnas were abundant enough to be readily detectable by northern blot. discrete bands in the 21- to 22-nt size range were detected in 293t cells infected with hev71d23a (figure 4a, lanes 5–7) by using two different rna oligo probes complementary to two negative-stranded viral sirnas (marked by stars in figure 3e). the hev71d23a-derived sirnas also accumulated to high levels figure 2. the replication of 3a-deficient mutants of hev71 was inhibited (a) hev71 genome and the mutation sites of d23a and r34a of 3a.

(legend continued on next page) immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 997 in human rd cells (figure 4b, lanes 5 and 6). moreover, viral sirnas were also produced in rd cells infected with hev71r34a (figure 4b, lane 9). these results provide an independent verification of the production, size, and abundance of the deep-sequenced hev71-derived sirnas. in contrast to infection with 3a-deficient hev71, viral sirnas were undetectable in either 293t or rd cells infected with hev71wt (figure 4a, lanes 2–4; figure 4b, lanes 1–3), indicating that the biogenesis of the hev71-derived sirnas was suppressed by 3a expressed in cis from the viral genome, consistent with the results of deep sequencing (figure 3a). together, our findings show that hev71 3a does function as an authentic vsr in a viral infection context, and when the 3a-mediated suppression of rnai was genetically impaired in hev71,rnai response was effectively induced to produce readily detectable dicer-dependent viral sirnas in human somatic cells. rnai plays an antiviral role in human somatic cells upon confirming that rnai response could be triggered by infection of vsr-deficient hev71, but not wt hev71, we sought to determine if rnai plays an antiviral role in hev71-infected human somatic cells. to this end, human 293t or rd cells were infected with wt or vsr-deficient hev71, and viral rna accumulation, virus titer, virion production, and viral sirna production were determined. as expected, the viral rna accumulation and virion production of hev71d23a or hev71r34a were restricted in both 293t and rd cells (figures 5a, 5b, and s3a–s3d), consistent with the virus titer assays (figures 2d and s4a and s4b). correspondingly, significant amounts of viral sirnas, readily detected by northern blot, were produced in cells infected with hev71d23a or hev71r34a, but not hev71wt (figures 4a, 4b, 5b, and s3b). moreover, if rnai response is indeed antiviral, the rescue of vsr-deficient viruses should be observed in rnai-compromised cells (cullen et al., 2013). our data showed that viral rna replication and virion production of hev71d23a or hev71r34a were rescued by ectopic expression of nov b2 or hev71 3a, but not the vsr-deficient mutant of b2 (b2r59q, also termed ‘‘mb2’’) or 3a (3ad23a) (figures 5a, 5b and s3a–s3d). correspondingly, viral sirna biogenesis was blocked by ectopic expression of b2 or 3a, but not mb2 or 3ad23a (figures 5b and s3b, lanes 4–7). more importantly, the deficiency of dicer in 293t or rd cells efficiently rescued the replication of hev71d23a or hev71r34a (figures 5a, 5b, s3a–s3d, and s4a–s4d). as expected, dicer deficiency eliminated viral sirna production (figures 5b and s3b, lane 8), consistent with our deep sequencing data (table s1). therefore, our data show that vsr-deficient viruses can be rescued in (c) the distribution of vsrna reads (22-nt size) in the positive- and negative-stranded hev71 genome and the relative abundances of positive- and negativestranded vsrnas are indicated.

to rna-ip with anti-3a antibody. the precipitated rnas were treated in the presence or absence of rnase i or rnase iii and then detected by northern blotting using rna probes targeting positive- and negative-stranded hev71 genomic 1–700 nt. precipitated 3a and 3ab proteins were detected by western blots with anti-3a antibody. each experiment has been repeated at least three times independently.

additionally, ectopically expressing 3a moderately inhibited polyi:c-stimulated ifn-b induction in 293 cells stably expressing tlr3, comparing with the strong effect of ebov vp35, a wellknown ifn-i antagonist (figure s4g). besides, ectopic expression of 3a did not inhibit the induction of ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) (figure s4h). thus, hev71 3a has a minor inhibitory effect on ifn-i induction in cells. to exclude the potential interference of ifn-i response, we treated wt or nodice 293t cells infected by hev71d23a with ruxolitinib, a well-known jak1 and jak3 inhibitor (mesa et al., 2012), to block ifn-i response. we found that the rna accumulation of hev71d23a in ruxolitinib-treated dicer-deficient cells was significantly higher than that in ruxolitinib-treated wt cells (figure 5a), showing that the rescuing effect of compromising rnai on viral replication is independent of ifn-i response. interestingly, continuous culturing of hev71r34a resulted in two different spontaneous mutations, i.e., mutations to wt and valine (v), and hev71r34v exhibited similar plaque and growth patterns with hev71wt and did not trigger viral sirna production in rd cells (figure s5), showing that 3ar34v also has vsr activity. the rapid reverse mutations of hev71r34a are probably due to the pressure of natural selection, further confirming the importance of vsr in viral replication. together, our data show that rnai indeed functions as an antiviral immunity in an ifn-independent manner in human somatic cells. hev71-derived sirnas load into ago and are active to degrade cognate viral rna sequence in mammalian rnai pathway, sirnas mainly load into ago2, the only mammalian ago that exhibits cleavage activity, to guide the destruction of cognate rna (liu et al., 2004). to further confirm the antiviral role of virus-triggered rnai response, we first sought to determine if hev71-derived sirnas can load into ago-risc. after infection of 293t or rd cells by wt or mutant viruses, small rnas were subjected to rna-immunoprecipitation (rna-ip) with anti-pan ago antibody. our results showed that viral sirnas in cells infected by hev71d23a or hev71r34a were coimmunoprecipitated with ago (figures 5b and s3b, bottom; figure s3d, top). subsequently, we sought to determine if these hev71-derived sirnas are really able to specifically guide the degradation of cognate hev71 genomic rnas. because hev71 genomic rnas can self-replicate to generate viral dsrnas in infected cells, it is difficult to distinguish whether the clearance of hev71 rnas is mediated by sirna-guided ago cleavage of hev71 genomic rna or by dicer cleavage of hev71 dsrnas. to address this issue, we designed a plasmid that transcribes an mrna containing egfp orf followed by the sequences of 600–700 nt of the hev71 genome, named ‘‘egfp-hev71600–700.’’ this region of the hev71 genome contains no predicted rna secondary structure (figure s2c) and is complementary with a serial of viral sirnasproducedin cells infected withhev71d23a (figure4a). of note, the plasmid egfp-hev711200–1300, which was constructed using the same strategy but is not complementary with hev71-derived sirnas (figure 3c), was used as a negative control. in addition, the egfp-hev71600–700 and egfphev711200– 1300 mrnas are unable to generate dsrnas, making them potential targets for hev71-derived sirna-guided rnai, but not dicer-mediated cleavage. as shown in figure 5c, the mrna levels of egfp-hev71600–700 were substantially reduced by infection withhev71d23acompared to infection withhev71wt. bycontrast, neitherhev71d23a norhev71wt showed any effect in cells expressing egfp or egfp-hev711200–1300 (figure 5c, lanes 1–3 and 7–9). as expected, hev71d23a-infection cannot reduce egfp-hev71600–700 mrna level in nodice cells (figure 5c, lanes 10–12). in conclusion, hev71-derived sirnas indeed load into ago and are active to guide sequence-specific destruction of cognate viral rna sequence in a dicer-dependent manner. hev71 3a sequestrates viral dsrnas in infected cells upon confirming that rnai plays an antiviral role in human somatic cells, we sought to determine if the incapability of hev71wt to trigger rnai response and viral sirna production is indeed due to the vsr activity of 3a in an authentic viral infection context. to this end, we performed rna-ip with anti-3a antibody in the lysates prepared from 293t cells infected with hev71wt or hev71d23a. total rnas extracted from the inputs and the rna-ip products were subjected to northern blotting by using rna probes targeting positive- and negative-stranded hev71 genomes 1–700 nt. viral rnas of both polarities were readily detected in rna-ip products from 293t cells infected with hev71wt (figure 5d), while the complete viral genomic rnas were detected in inputs (figure s3e). the molecular weights of these viral rnas spanned a broad spectrum, possibly consisting of rna-ip-enriched replicative intermediates or degradation products (figure 5d, lane 2). moreover, the 3a-bound viral rnas were double-stranded, as they were susceptible to dsrna-specific rnase iii but resistant to ssrnaspecific rnase i (figure 5d). in addition, ectopically expressed 3a efficiently bound to viral rnas, which were also doublestranded, in cells infected with hev71d23a (figure 5d, lane 4), consistent with our findings that ectopic expression of 3a rescued viral replication and suppressed viral sirna biogenesis of vsr-deficient hev71. on the other hand, both virally and ectopically expressed 3ad23a barely associated with hev71 dsrnas in cells infected with hev71d23a (figure 5d, lanes 3 and 5). together, our data show that hev71 3a sequestrated viral dsrnas and could explain why virus-derived sirnas were barely detectable in human somatic cells infected with wt virus whose vsr activity is potent and intact. antiviral rnai restricts vsr-deficient hev71 replication in primary somatic cells and in mice we sought to expand our evaluation of viral sirna biogenesis and antiviral effects of rnai in primary somatic cells and animals. to this end, primary murine lung fibroblasts (mlfs) were isolated from 8- to 10-week-old wt or ifnar1/ c57/b6 mice and infected with wt or d23a hev71, respectively. our data showed that the vsr deficiency substantially restricted the viral replication and virion production of hev71 inwtor ifnar1/ mlfs at 12 or 24 hpi (figures 6a and 6b), consistent with our observations in human 293t and rd cells (figures 5 and s3). in addition, infection with hev71d23a triggered the production of hev71-derived sirnas, which were readily detectable via northern blotting, in 1000 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 figure 6. vsr-deficient hev71 triggers viral sirna

(d) groups of 1-day-old ifnar1/ a129 mice (n = 5) were intracerebrally injected with 1 3 107 pfu of hev71wt or hev71d23a. the mortalities were monitored for 15 days or until death. the significance between survival curves from each group was analyzed by kaplan-meier survival analysis with log-rank tests. (e) groups of 1-day-old ifnar1/ a129 mice (n = 3) intracerebrally injected the same titer of the viruses as noted in (d) were dissected at 6, 24, 48, and 120 hpi. mouse brains were collected, homogenized, and then subjected to standard plaque assays for determining the viral titers. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 as measured by two-way anova (graphpad prism). (f) total rnas were extracted from the same mouse brain samples as noted in (e) and subjected to northern blotting with rna probes targeting positive- or negative-stranded hev71 genomic rnas, viral sirnas, mir-21, or u6. ten times more rnas were loaded for the detection of negative-stranded hev71 genomic rnas than for positive-stranded genomic rnas. 18 s rrna was used as loading controls. each experiment has been repeated at least three times independently. see also figure s6. immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 1001 wt or ifnar1/ mlfs (figures 6b and 6c), while hev71wt failed to do so (figures 6b and 6c). besides, our rna-ip assay revealed that viral sirnas produced in hev71d23a-infected mlfs also loaded into ago (figure 6b, lane 3, bottom). moreover, although ifn-b induction was moderately more enhanced by hev71d23a than by hev71wt in wt mlfs (figure s6c), consistent with our observation in 293t cells (figures s4e and s4f), the knockdown of dicer in either wt or ifnar1/ mlfs (figure s6a) efficiently rescued the replication of hev71d23a (figures 6a and s6b), further confirming that the antiviral role of rnai is independent of ifn-i response. besides, the dicer deficiency expectedly eliminated the production of viral sirnas in either cells (figure 6c). next, we determined the different antiviral responses against the wt and vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 in ifnar1/ a129 mice that lack ifn-i receptors. of note, the usage of ifnar1/ mice can exclude the potentially different effects of ifn-i response against the wt and mutant virus (goubau et al., 2013). groups of 1-day-old a129 mice were intracerebrally challenged with 13107 pfu of hev71wt or hev71d23a; and the mortalities of the infected mice were monitored for 2 weeks. as shown in figure 6d, the hev71wt-infected mice all died within 5 days, whereas the hev71d23a-infected mice all survived. mouse brains derived from hev71wt- or hev71d23a-infected a129 mice at 6, 24, 48, and 120 hpi were extracted, and the virus titers were determined, showing that the replication of hev71d23a was substantially restricted compared to that of hev71wt (figure 6e). additionally, although the positivestranded hev71 genomic rnas were accumulated at high levels at 24 hpi in the brains of hev71wt-infected mice (figure 6f, lane 1), they were accumulated at lower levels from 6–48 hpi and then reduced to an almost undetectable level at 120 hpi during hev71d23a infection (figure 6f, lanes 3–5). besides, negativestranded antigenomic rnas became readily detectable at 24 and 48 hpi of hev71d23a (figure 6f, lanes 3 and 4), showing that hev71d23a rnas replicated but were rapidly cleared in infected mice. furthermore, we found that the production of viral sirnas was triggered by infection of a129 mice with hev71d23a, but not hev71wt, at 24 and 48 hpi (figure 6f, lanes 3 and 4). the viral sirnas became undetectable at 120 hpi (figure 6f, lane 5), coinciding with the clearance of the replication products (i.e., genomic and antigenomic rnas) of hev71d23a (figure 6f, lane 5). in summary, our findings show that, similarly to that in human somatic cells, vsr-deficient hev71 triggered the production of readily detectable virus-derived sirnas, which was closely associated with viral clearance and dramatically reduced pathogenicity, in a dicer-dependent but ifn-independent manner both in primary mammalian somatic cells and mice. discussion it has been unclear whether infection by any mammalian viruses would induce and suppress antiviral rnai response in mammals, mostly because mammalian somatic cells infected by diverse wt mammalian rna viruses failed to produce readily detectable viral sirnas or only express very low levels of vsrnas that lack sirna properties and are likely random degradation products of viral genomic rnas. to solve this enigma, several possibilities have been proposed (cullen et al., 2013; kennedy et al., 2015; li et al., 2013). one possibility is that wt dicer expressed in mammalian somatic cells may lack the ability to produce sirnas from long dsrnas. this possibility is partly supported by previous findings that the n-terminal helicase domain of mammalian dicer plays an autoinhibitory role on its sirna processing activity (flemr et al., 2013; ma et al., 2008), and ectopic expression of an n-terminally truncated human dicer mutant could produce viral sirnas in human somatic cells infected by iav (kennedy et al., 2015). moreover, it has been suggested that undifferentiated murine cells, like mescs and oocytes, express an n-terminally truncated isoform of murine dicer (nejepinska et al., 2012; tam et al., 2008; watanabe et al., 2008), which may explain why mescs produced viral sirnas in response to emcv infection (maillard et al., 2013). however, these observations do not exclude the possibility that wt dicer retains some sirna producing ability. indeed, although the short dicer isoform is not naturally expressed in human or murine somatic cells, our data show that viral sirnas were produced abundantly in human or murine somatic cells and mice infected by vsr-deficient hev71, demonstrating that wt dicer is still able to process viral dsrnas into sirnas. it is noteworthy that our finding and the aforementioned possibility are not mutually exclusive, as the n-terminal domain may partially inhibit but not abolish sirna production, and such an autoinhibition of dicer may be regulated by viral or host factors. the other possibility is that in the context of viral infection, viruses encode vsrs as an immune evasion mechanism that suppresses viral sirna production in mammalian somatic cells. this possibility has been discussed (cullen et al., 2013; kennedy et al., 2015; li et al., 2013; maillard et al., 2013) and supported by recent studies in which readily detectable viral sirnas were observed in mammalian somatic cells infected with a b2-deficient nov or ns1-deleted iav (li et al., 2016; li et al., 2013). however, nov is an insect nodavirus, while iav ns1 is a well-characterized ifn antagonist, and ns1 deletion did not prevent iav from replicating and inducing disease and death in ifn-defective mice (garcı´a- sastre et al., 1998). thus far, the strongest evidence is the identification of hev71 3a as an authentic vsr. enteroviral 3a and its precursor 3ab are critical components of viral rna replication complex (teterina et al., 2011), while their exact functions in viral rna replication remain unclear (gao et al., 2015). we found that infection by vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 triggered the dicer-dependent production of viral sirnas in different human or murine somatic cells, as well as in vivo. moreover, during hev71 infection, virally expressed 3a did bind hev71 dsrnas in human somatic cells, while vsr-deficient 3a mutant failed to do so. interestingly, the vsr activity of 3a appears to be under high pressure of natural selection, as a vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 (hev71r34a) exhibited rapid spontaneous reverse mutations, further confirming the importance of vsr for hev71 replication. the production of abundant virus-derived sirnas clearly shows that viral dsrna replicative intermediates are indeed processed by dicer in mammals. however, these findings only provide compelling evidence, but not direct demonstration, of 1002 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 antiviral rnai in mammals, and extra evidence is required to show that virus-induced rnai does have antiviral activity: first, vsr-deficient viruses should be rescued by genetic ablation of key rnai component; second, viral sirnas should load into risc and be active to degrade cognate viral rnas. although previous studies using nov, emcv, or iav did not address this issue (li et al., 2016; li et al., 2013; maillard et al., 2013), our findings show that hev71-derived sirnas load into ago2-risc and are fully active to degrade cognate hev71 rna sequence and vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 is significantly restricted in human somatic cells, primary somatic cells and mice, while dicer deficiency successfully rescues mutant hev71 replication. in addition to being recognized by dicer, viral dsrnas are usually recognized by rig-i-mda5 and tlr3 to induce ifn-i responses against viral infection (goubau et al., 2013), and ifn-i response has been found to suppress rnai by inhibiting risc (maillard et al., 2016; seo et al., 2013). moreover, many vsrs such as nov b2 and iav ns1 are dsrna-binding proteins, and it remains unclear if the restricted replication and pathogenicity of mutant viruses are due to their inabilities to suppress viral sirna production or ifn response. we also observed that 3a has a minor ifn-i suppression activity in cells. to exclude the potential interference of ifn-i, mammalian somatic cells or mice that are unable to mount ifn-i responses need to be challenged by wt and vsr-deficient viruses (cullen et al., 2013). indeed, vsr-deficient hev71 triggered the production of readily detectable viral sirnas in ifnar1/ mlfs and mice, and correspondingly, the replication and pathogenicity of the mutant virus were also dramatically restricted. in addition, when ifn-i response was blocked, the genetic ablation of dicer still rescued the replication of vsr-deficient hev71 both in vitro and ex vivo. thus, 3a does protect hev71 from antiviral rnai independently of ifn response in mammals. in conclusion, our findings demonstrate that hev71 expresses protein 3a as vsr to effectively suppress the production of virally derived sirnas and antiviral rnai immunity in human somatic cell lines, murine primary somatic cells, and mice. to our best knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the production of readily detectable virus-derived sirnas by wt dicer in an ifn-independent manner in vivo, and our study further shows that these viral sirnas have antiviral activity by loading into risc and specifically silencing cognate viral rna sequence. in addition, it uncovers for the first time the detailed mechanism by which a human positive-stranded rna virus acts to evade antiviral rnai both in vitro and in vivo. based upon the data presented here and in previous studies, either enhancing the activity of the rnai pathway or directly targeting vsrs like hev71 3a may be promising strategies to develop novel antiviral therapies, and rnai should function as an important antiviral immunity against more rna viruses that include many important emerging and reemerging human pathogens, therefore representing an exciting avenue for future studies. star+methods detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: d key resources table d contact for reagent and resource sharing d experimental model and subject details b cell culture b virus b mice d method details b plasmids and rnas b construction and recovery of hev71 mutant viruses b virus infection, plaque assays and ifa b rna extraction, northern blotting and qrt-pcr b western blotting b crispr/cas9 knockout b expression and purification of recombinant proteins, gel shift and in vitro dicer cleavage assays b rna-ip b deep sequencing and data analysis b mouse experiments d quantification and statistical analysis d data and software availability supplemental information supplemental information includes six figures and two tables and can be found with this article online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2017. 05.006. author contributions y.q. and y.x. performed experiments with the help of h.z., y.-q.d., x.-f.l., f.-c.z., andm.m.;

maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) (gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (gibco), 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37c in a humidified atmosphere with5%co2. the nodice 293t cell line (bogerd et al., 2014b) was generously provided by dr. bryan r. cullen (durham, nc, usa). the 293-tlr3 cell line (lei et al., 2010) was generously provided by dr. hong-bing shu (wuhan, china). the drosophila s2 cells were cultured in at 27c in schneider’s insect medium (gibco) supplemented with 10% fbs (gibco). primary mlfs were isolated from wt or ifnar1/ c57/b6 mice as described (zhang et al., 2016). briefly, lungs were minced and digested in calcium- and magnesium-free hank’s balanced salt solution (hbss) buffer (thermo) supplemented with 10 mg/ml type ii collagenase (worthington) and 20 mg/ml dnase i (sigma-aldrich) for 3 hr at 37c with shaking. cell suspensions were filtered through progressively smaller cell strainers (100 and 40 mm). filtered cells were plated in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. one hour later, adherent fibroblasts were rinsed with hbss and cultured for the subsequent experiments. for knockdown of dicer, wt or ifnar1/ mlfs were transfected with two different pairs of sirnas (sidicer#1 and sidicer#2) targeting the orf of mouse dicer gene, respectively. two days after transfection, mlfs were reseeded and then infected with wt or mutant viruses, respectively. the nucleotide sequences of dicer sirnas were shown in table. s2. virus hev71 strain h (vr-1432) were obtained from atcc, and amplified in rd cells. mice the 129/sv/ev mice deficient in ifn-a/b receptor (a129 mice) were kindly provided by dr. qi-bin leng (shanghai,china) (li et al., 2017). mice were specific pathogen free and maintained under a 12 hr light/dark cycle with standard chow diet. all animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the guidelines of the chinese regulations of laboratory animals (ministry of science and technology of china) and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at beijing institute of microbiology and epidemiology. method details plasmids and rnas for the reversal-of-silencing assay in mammals, the plasmid pegfp-c1 was used to express the enhanced green fluorescent (egfp) protein. hev71 viral proteins were cloned into mammalian expression vector prk-flag (kindly provided by dr. hong-bing shu, wuhan, china). mutations were introduced into the hev71 3a coding region by pcr-mediated mutagenesis, with appropriate primers containing the desired nucleotide changes (table s2). for rnai suppression assays in drosophila s2 cells, the egfp reporter gene and the fhv b2 were constructed into the insect expressing vector pac5.1/v5-hisb as previously described (qi et al., 2012). hev71 3a protein orf fragment was cloned into pac5.1/v5-hisb vector. the sirnas targeting human dicer and ago2 were synthesized by ribobio (guangzhou, china). full-length cdna of fhv rna1 and rna1-db2 (t2739c and c2910a) encoded in cuso4- induced pmt vector were kindly provided by dr. shou-wei ding (riverside, ca, usa). the 400-nt dsrna for egfp silencing in s2 cells and the 500-nt dsrnas for knockdown of dicer-2 and ago2 of s2 cells were generated by in vitro transcription. plasmids for the purification of mbp fusion protein 3a were constructed by inserting 3a orf into pmal-c2x vector. construction and recovery of hev71 mutant viruses d23a and r34a mutations in 3a were introduced into the infectious hev71 cdna clone (hev71 strain vr1432, agt18270) by pcrmediated site-directed mutagenesis. the positive clones confirmed by sequencing were linearized by mlu i, and then subjected to in vitro transcription by using sp6 rna polymerase (promega). rna transcripts were then transfected into rd cells with lipofectamine 3000, and rescued viruses were harvested 1 to 2 days after transfection. viruses were concentrated by amicon ultra-15 filters (millipore) and the titers of viruses were measured by plaque assays. virus infection, plaque assays and ifa at the day of infection, the medium was changed with dmem without fbs and viruses added at an moi of 10 on 50%–70% confluent rd, 293t cells or mlfs cultured in 6-wells plates or 15-cm2 dishes. cells were incubated for 1 hr to allow adsorption, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and then the complete medium was added. for the rescue experiments, cells were first transfected with the empty prk-flag vector or prk-flag vector encoding b2, mb2, 3a or 3ad23a, respectively. two day after transfection, the cells were subjected to selection with g418 (200 mg/ml) (invivogen) for 48 hr and then re-plated for infection. plaque assays were performed on rd cells in 12-well plates infected with a 10-fold serial dilution of viruses. the plates were incubated at 37c for 1 hr to allow adsorption. then the supernatant was removed, and cells were overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose (sigma-aldrich) in dmem containing 2% fbs. after further incubation at 37c for 4 days, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet to visualize the plaques. immunity 46, 992–1004.e1–e5, june 20, 2017 e3 for ifa, rd cells were seeded in 60-mm-diameter culture dishes containing a 1-cm2 coverslip inside were infected with viruses at an moi of 10. at 24 hpi, the coverslips containing infected cells were removed and directly used for ifa analysis. the cells on the coverslip were fixed with ice-cold acetone and incubated with primary anti-vp1 antibody at 37c for 1 hr. cells were washed three times with pbs and then incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse igg antibody conjugated to alexa fluor 488 (abcam) in pbs for 40 min at 37c. rna extraction, northern blotting and qrt-pcr for egfp mrna detection, total rnas were extracted using trizol reagent (thermo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for the samples required for detection of both viral sirnas and viral genomic rnas, small rna-enriched total rnas were isolated using the mirneasy mini kit (qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for northern blot analysis of high-molecularweight (hmw) rna, 5 mg of total rnas were resolved on denaturing 1.5% agarose gels with 2.2mformaldehyde, capillary transferred to hybond-a nylon membrane (ge healthcare). equal loading was verified before transfer by ethidium bromide staining of total rna within the rna gels. for northern blot analysis of low-molecular-weight (lmw) rna, 20 mg of small rna-enriched total rnas were resolved on 7 m urea-15% page, transferred to hybond-a nylon membrane (ge healthcare) and chemically cross-linked using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (edc) as previously described (kim et al., 2010). the probe for detection of egfp mrna was complementary to the 500-720 nt of egfp orf region. the probes for detection of hev71 genomic rnas were complementary to the 1-700 nt of hev71 genome of both polarities. these rna probes were labeled with dig-utp (roche) by in vitro transcription. for detection of small rnas, dig-labeled oligo rna probes targeting egfp sirna, viral sirnas (vsirnas), mir-92a, mir-21 and u6 were synthesized by takara. qrt-pcr was performed with the primers targeting egfp orf or hev71 genome. all the primers and oligonucleotides used here are shown in table s2. western blotting cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer [50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl, 1% np40, 0.25% deoxycholate and a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche)], and the lysates were then subjected to 10% (figure s1a) or 15% (the other figures) sds-page and western blotting. the anti-3a polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against peptide gppkfkpikisleec (genscript antibody service, nanjing, china). crispr/cas9 knockout the dicer crispr/cas9 ko plasmid (sc-400365, santa cruz biotech) was used to knockout dicer gene in human rd cells according to manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, after transfection with the crispr/cas9 ko plasmids, rd cells were allowed for cultured for 3 days and then selected by puromycin (10 mg/ml) (invivogen). the resulting clones were confirmed by dna-sequencing and western blotting. expression and purification of recombinant proteins, gel shift and in vitro dicer cleavage assays for expression and purification of recombinant mbp-fusion proteins, mbp-3a and its mutants as well as the negative control protein mbp were expressed in e. coli strain tb1 at 27c in the presence of 0.2 mm iptg. cell pellets were resuspended in binding buffer [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 200 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1.5% triton x-100 and a protease inhibitors cocktail (roche). cells were lysed by sonication and then debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 11,000 3 g. the proteins in the supernatant were purified using amylose resin (new england biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and concentrated using amicon ultra-15 filters (millipore). all proteins were quantified via a uv-visible spectrophotometer (shimadzu). for gel shift assay, mbp-fusion proteins (0.5 to 16 mm) was incubated with 0.1 mmof dig-labeled 200-nt dsrna probe in a binding buffer [50 mm hepes (ph 8.0), 15 mm nacl, 0.5 mm mgcl2, 10% glycerol and 1 u of rnase inhibitor (promega)] at 37c for 30 min; the total volume was 10 ml. for competition assays, 2 mm of mbp-3a was incubated with 0.1 mm dig-labeled dsrna and increasing amounts (0.2-5 mm) of unlabeled dsrna or ssrna. after the binding reaction, the samples were analyzed via 6% native-page in 0.5 3 tbe buffer in a cold room and transferred to hybond-a nylon membrane (ge healthcare). the membranes were incubated for 30 min with anti-dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (roche). the rna probe representing the egfp nt 1-200 was labeled with dig-utp (roche) for in vitro transcription. for the in vitro dicer cleavage assay, 0.4 mg of 200-nt dsrna was incubated with 0.5 u of a recombinant human dicer enzyme (t510002, genlantis) and mbp-fusion proteins (1 and 10 mm) in a reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer at 37c for 16 hr. the dicer-treated rnas were purified from the reaction complex by using trizol reagent (thermo) and then separated on 7 m urea-15% page; the rnas were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. rna-ip rna-ip was performed as previously described (qi et al., 2012) with minor modification. briefly, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 200 mm nacl, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5% triton x-100, 0.5 u/ml rnase inhibitor (promega) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche)]. after centrifugation, the postnuclear lysates were pre-cleared via incubation with protein-a/g agarose beads (roche) together with goat anti-mouse igg at 4c for 4 hr. then the pre-cleared lysates were incubated with antibodies e4 immunity 46, 992–1004.e1–e5, june 20, 2017 (anti-pan ago2 or anti-3a) together with protein-a/g agarose beads (roche) at 4c for 12 hr. the antibody-bound complexes were washed for five times with the same lysis buffer except that nacl concentration was raised to 600 mm. finally, rnas or proteins were extracted from the complexes and subjected to northern or western blotting as noted above. for detecting the 3a-bound rnas, the rnas in complexes were extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then treated with rnase i or rnase iii (new england biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol before they were subjected to northern blotting. deep sequencing and data analysis libraries of small rnas from cell culture were constructed using truseq small rna library preparation kits (illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. the libraries were sequenced by illumina hiseq 2000 at ribobio. the sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (release hg19) by using bowite 2.2.5 and the cellular mirna expression level was determined on the basis of the number of reads that was identical to the annotated mirna sequences in mirbase version 18, only allowing 2 or +2 nt to be templated by the corresponding genomic sequence at the 30 end. viral small rna (vsrna) reads which cannot be mapped to human genome were then mapped to hev71 genome with 100% identity. the subsequent analysis of length and location of these vsrnas were calculated using in-house perl scripts. pairs of complementary 22-nt vsrnas in each library in different distance categories were computed using principles as previously described (li et al., 2016; li et al., 2013). mouse experiments groups of 1-day-old a129 mice (n = 5) were inoculated by the intracerebrally injected with 13107 pfu of viruses. animals were monitored for 15 days after inoculation. any mice found in a moribund condition were euthanatized and scored as dead. in addition, groups of 1-day-old a129 mice (n = 3) intracerebrally injected with 1 3 107 pfu of viruses were dissected at 6, 24, 48, and 120 hpi. mouse brains were collected, homogenized and diluted with pbs to make final 10% (w/v) suspensions. the viremia were measured by plaque assay. quantification and statistical analysis graphpad prism was used for all statistical analyses. all experiments were repeated at least three times. statistical analysis was carried out by unpaired t test or two-way anova (graphpad prism). p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. data and software availability the rna-seq data has been deposited to the ncbi geo database under the accession number geo: gse99252. immunity 46, 992–1004.e1–e5, june 20,

potent antiviral immunity in plants and invertebrates; however, whether rnai plays antiviral roles in mammals remains unclear. here, using human enterovirus 71 (hev71) as a model, we showed hev71 3a protein as an authentic viral suppressor of rnai during viral infection. when the 3a-mediated rnai suppression was impaired, the mutant hev71 readily triggered the production of abundant hev71-derived small rnas with canonical sirna properties in cells and mice. these virus-derived sirnas were produced from viral dsrna replicative intermediates in a dicer-dependent manner and loaded into ago, and they were fully active in degrading cognate viral rnas. recombinant hev71 deficient in 3a-mediated rnai suppression was significantly restricted in human somatic cells and mice, whereas dicer deficiency rescued hev71 infection independently of type i interferon response. thus, rnai can function as an antiviral immunity, which is induced and suppressed by a human virus, in mammals. introduction rnai is an evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in eukaryotes (carthew and sontheimer, 2009; kim et al., 2009) and has been well recognized as an innate antiviral immunity in fungi, plants, and invertebrates. in the process of antiviral rnai, viral dsrna (double-stranded rna) replicative intermediates generated during rna virus replication are recognized and processed by dicer endoribonuclease into 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) sirnas (small interfering rnas) that contain perfectly base-paired central regions with 2-nt 30 overhangs (ding, 2010). these virus-derived sirnas (also named viral sirnas) are then transferred by dicer into argonaute (ago) proteins, the core components of rna-induced silencing complex (risc), to direct the cleavage of cognate viral rnas. thus, the fundamentals of antiviral rnai immunity are as follows: (1) viral infection induces the production of virus-derived sirnas, and (2) more importantly, these virus-derived sirnas or virusinduced rnai responses have antiviral activity (cullen et al., 2013; ding, 2010). however, when small rnas in a variety of mammalian somatic cells infected by various rna viruses, including influenza a virus (iav) and picornavirus, were subjected to deep sequencing, canonical sirna species derived from viral rnas were either not detected or detected at extremely low levels with an overwhelming bias for one strand (kennedy et al., 2015; parameswaran et al., 2010; weng et al., 2014). additionally, genetic ablation of dicer or ago2, the major ago protein responsible for the sirna pathway, failed to enhance virus replication in mammalian somatic cells (bogerd et al., 2014a; kennedy et al., 2015; parameswaran et al., 2010). thus, it remains an open question whether rnai functions as an antiviral defense in mammals, particularly in differentiated mammalian somatic cells. unlike mammalian somatic cells, embryonic stem cells (escs) have been found to produce readily detectable sirnas from long dsrnas (nejepinska et al., 2012; tam et al., 2008; watanabe et al., 2008). it has been reported that murine escs (mescs) infected by encephalomyocarditis virus (emcv) produced abundant viral sirnas, although the differentiation of mescs resulted in loss of both pluripotency and viral sirna production (maillard et al., 2013). moreover, murine oocytes have been found to express an n-terminally truncated isoform of dicer that can process dsrnas into sirnas (flemr et al., 2013). recently, cullen and colleagues reported that ectopic expression of an n-terminally truncated human dicer mutant could produce readily detectable viral sirnas in iav-infected human somatic cells. however, the shorter dicer isoform is rodent specific and not naturally present in human cells (kennedy et al., 2015). therefore, mescs and probably certain germline cells, which are undifferentiated and retain some pluripotency, are intrinsically different with differentiated somatic cells in producing sirnas. interestingly, ding and colleagues found that infection by a nodamura virus (nov) mutant that does not express protein b2 triggered the production of readily detectable nov-derived sirnas in rodent somatic cell lines and suckling mice (li et al., 992 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 ª 2017 elsevier inc. figure 1. hev71 3a suppresses dicer-mediated sirna biogenesis by sequestrating dsrna in vitro (a) 293t cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding egfp (0.1 mg) and egfp-specific shrna (0.3 mg), together with either empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding hev71 nonstructural protein or nov b2 (nb2) (0.3 mg for each). cells transfected with sirna of ago2 or nc sirna (50 nm for each) were used as (legend continued on next page) immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 993 2013). however, nov is an insect virus, but not a mammalian virus that belongs to the same positive-stranded rna virus family (nodaviridae) with other insect nodaviruses such as flock house virus (fhv) and wuhan nodavirus (li et al., 2002; qi et al., 2012). most insect or plant rna viruses encode viral suppressors of rnai (vsrs) to antagonize antiviral rnai (ding, 2010). nodaviral b2 proteins are among the best-characterized vsrs and suppress antiviral rnai in insects by sequestering viral dsrnas and targeting rnai pathway component (aliyari et al., 2008; li et al., 2002; qi et al., 2012). moreover, some mammalian viral proteins, like iav ns1 and ebola virus (ebov) vp35, have been reported to suppress rnai in vitro (haasnoot et al., 2007; li et al., 2016). therefore, the identification of an authentic vsr encoded by a mammalian virus would be the key step to answering the fundamental questions: (1) can viral infection induce viral sirna production?; and (2) does virus-induced rnai have antiviral activity in mammals? enteroviruses are a genus of positive-stranded rna viruses in the family picornaviridae and include numerous important human pathogens, such as poliovirus, hev71, echoviruses, and coxsackieviruses that annually infect around 3,000,000,000 people and are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases. especially, hev71 infection in infants and young children causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (hfmd) and severe neurological manifestations and has emerged as one of the major global threats to public health. in addition, human enteroviruses are among the best-characterized rna viruses and have served as important models in the development of modern virology (shih et al., 2011). here, we first identified the nonstructural protein 3a of hev71 as the vsr that inhibits dicer-mediated sirnas biogenesis by sequestrating dsrnas. when the 3a-mediated suppression of rnai was impaired by point mutations, the vsr-deficient mutant viruses effectively triggered rnai response in both mammalian somatic cells and mice, producing abundant hev71-derived small rnas with all of the properties of canonical sirnas. these hev71-derived sirnas are dicerdependently produced from viral dsrna replicative intermediates, loaded into ago-risc, and are fully active to degrade cognate viral genomic rnas. most importantly, the vsr-deficient mutants of hev71 are significantly restricted in human somatic cells and mice, while dicer deficiency successfully restored hev71 infection independently of type i interferon (ifn-i) response. overall, our findings highlight that rnai can indeed function as antiviral immunity in mammals, and here, we showed that it is induced and suppressed by hev71. results hev71 nonstructural protein 3a is a potential vsr to determine whether hev71 encodes proteins that work as potential vsrs, we examined all hev71-encoded nonstructural proteins via a reversal-of-silencing assay. in this assay, cultured human hek293t cells were co-transfected with the plasmids encoding egfp and egfp-specific small hairpin rna (shrna), which is cleaved by dicer to produce sirna, together with vectors for hev71 nonstructural proteins. two days after transfection, egfp mrna levels were determined by northern blot (figure 1a), and the protein expression was determined by western blot (figure s1a). the egfp-specific shrna eliminated the egfp transcripts (figure 1a), confirming that the rnai is effective. we found that the expression of the 3a protein and its precursor 3ab effectively rescued the accumulation of egfp mrna, indicating that 3a is a potential vsr (figure 1a, lanes 8 and 9). in addition, ectopically expressing nov b2 or knocking down ago2 (figure s1b) expectedly inhibited the shrnainduced rnai (figure 1a, lanes 4 and 12; figure s1c). since the rnai pathway is conserved from plants to animals, we sought to determine if 3a is also able to suppress dsrnainduced rnai in insect cells. our data showed that ectopic expression of hev71 3a effectively suppressed the dsrnainduced rnai in cultured drosophila s2 cells (figure s1d, lane 5). moreover, ectopically expressing fhv b2 (fb2), another well-established vsr, or knocking down fly dicer-2 or ago2 (figure s1e) also suppressed rnai (figure s1d), as expected. to further confirm the in vitro rnai suppression activity of hev71 3a, we adopted another canonical assay in cultured s2 cells. in this assay, a vsr-deficient mutant of fhv replicon (pfr1-db2) was expressed in s2 cells. owing to a lack of b2, this mutant replicon was unable to suppress antiviral rnai, resulting in the near clearance of self-replicated fhv rna1 and rna3 in s2 cells (figure s1f, compared lanes 1 and 2). this replication defect of the vsr-deficient replicon could be partially rescued by the ectopic expression of either fhv b2 or hev71 3a (figure s1f, lanes 3 and 4) or by the knockdown of fly ago2 controls. at 48 hr after transfection, total rnas were extracted, and the level of egfp mrna was examined via northern blotting with dig-labeled rna probe targeting the egfp orf 500–720 nt. 18 s rrna was used as loading control. (b) increasing amount (0–4 mm) of mbp-fusion hev71 3a (mbp-3a) was incubated with 0.1 mm 200-nt dig-labeled dsrna at 37c for 30 min. complexes were separated on 6% native-page, transferred to membranes, and then incubated with anti-dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. for competition assays, 2 mm of mbp-3a was incubated with 0.1 mm dig-labeled dsrna and increasing amounts (0.2–5 mm) of unlabeled dsrna or ssrna. (c) 293t cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding egfp (0.1 mg) and egfp-specific shrna (0.3 mg), together with the plasmids encoding hev71 3a wt or mutants (0.3 mg for each). the egfp mrna levels were determined by qrt-pcr with that in the presence of wt 3a defined as 100%. data represent means and standard deviations (sd) of three independent experiments. cell lysates were also subjected to western blotting with anti-flag and anti-a-tubulin antibodies. (d) northern blotting of egfp mrna levels of 293t cells co-transfected with a plasmid encoding egfp and egfp-specific shrna, together with either empty plasmid or the plasmid encoding nb2, 3a, or its mutants (3ad23a and 3ar34a). (e) increasing amounts (1–16 mm) of mbp-3ad23a or mbp-3ar34a were incubated with 0.1 mm 200-nt dig-labeled dsrna at 37c for 30 min. complexes were analyzed as noted above. (f) 293t cells were co-transfected with egfp-specific shrna (0.3 mg) and either the increasing amounts (0.1–0.3 mg) of the plasmid encoding 3a or its mutants (3ad23a and 3ar34a). total rnas were subjected to northern blotting with either dig-labeled oligo rna probe targeting egfp-shrna or u6. the synthetic 21- and 25-nt rnas were used as size markers. cell lysates were also subjected to western blotting with anti-flag and anti-a-tubulin antibodies. (g) the purified proteins as indicated were incubated with 0.4 mg 200-nt dsrna together with a human recombinant dicer (0.5 u) at 37c for 16 hr. the rnas were separated on 7 m urea-15% page and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. each experiment has been repeated at least three times independently. see also figure s1. 994 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 (figure s1f, lane 5). together, these results showed that hev71 3a can block rnai in cells and is a potential vsr. hev71 3a suppresses dicer-mediated sirna biogenesis by sequestrating dsrna in vitro the 3a proteins encoded by poliovirus and coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) form a homodimer with each monomer consisting of two antiparallel a helices (strauss et al., 2003; wessels et al., 2006) (figure s1g), which is structurally similar to some vsrs such as nodaviral b2 that sequester dsrna from dicer cleavage (qi et al., 2012). to determine if hev71 3a binds to long dsrna, gel shift assays were conducted by incubating in-vitro-transcribed 200-nt digoxin (dig)-labeled dsrna with increasing concentrations of recombinant mbp-fusion 3a (mbp-3a, figure s1h). in addition, unlabeled dsrnas and ssrnas were used as competitors to further evaluate the affinities of 3a with dsrna and ssrna. the presence of 3a apparently resulted in the gel mobility shift of dig-labeled dsrna (figure 1b, lanes 3–6), and only the unlabeled dsrnas efficiently competed with dig-labeled dsrnas (figure 1b, lanes 7–9), while the ssrna competitor had a minimal effect (figure 1b, lanes 10–12). these results demonstrate that hev71 3a can bind long dsrna in vitro. to identify the critical residues responsible for dsrna-binding and rnai suppression activities of hev71 3a, we performed multiple sequence alignments of the positively charged residues of enterovirus 3as (figure s1g) and examined the single-point mutations of conserved arginine and lysine using the reversalof- silencing assay in 293t cells. in addition, because dimerization is required for vsr activities of many plant and insect viruses (qi et al., 2012), we also introduced a point mutation of asp23, located in the a2 helix of 3a, which is identical in all enteroviruses sequenced to date (figure s1g) and previously reported to be essential for 3a dimerization of poliovirus and cvb3 (strauss et al., 2003; wessels et al., 2006). our data showed that asp23 was also required for dimerization of hev71 3a (figure s1i). thus, we performed quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) to determine the effects of different mutants on egfp mrna levels and found that mutation of conserved asp23 or arg34 to alanine (d23a or r34a) substantially reduced the ability of 3a to suppress rnai (figure 1c). these results were further confirmed by northern blot (figure 1d, lanes 8 and 9). furthermore, we found that either the d23a or r34a mutation abolished dsrna-binding activity of hev71 3a (figure 1e), indicating that 3a requires long dsrna-binding activity to suppress rnai. next, we sought to determine whether hev71 3a could sequestrate dsrna from dicer cleavage in human somatic cells. small rnas were harvested from 293t cells co-expressing shrna together with 3a or its mutants and then subjected to northern blotting with a dig-labeled rna oligo probe that recognizes both the precursor shrna (pre-shrna) and mature sirna. as shown in figure 1f, the accumulation of 22-nt dicer-cleaved sirna was substantially lower in cells expressing 3a than in cells expressing empty vectors. as expected, 3ad23a and 3ar34a failed to suppress the processing of shrna into sirna (figure 1f, lanes 5–8). to further confirm the direct role of hev71 3a in protecting dsrna from dicer cleavage, we adopted an in vitro assay in which purified 200-nt dsrna, recombinant human dicer, and mbp-fusion 3a or its mutants were added. while dsrna was efficiently processed into 22-nt sirna in the presence of mbp alone, mbp-3ad23a, or mbp-3ar34a, the addition of mbp-3a protected dsrna from cleavage by dicer in a dosedependent manner (figure 1g). altogether, we conclude that hev71 3a suppresses rnai by sequestrating dsrna from dicer cleavage in vitro. hev71 3a inhibits dicer-dependent production of virus- derived sirnas in human somatic cells to investigate the vsr function of 3a in an authentic viral infection context, we introduced the d23a or r34a mutation in the 3a coding region of the infectious clone of the hev71 strain vr1432 (figure 2a). the wild-type (wt) and mutant viruses were all viable and successfully recovered in human rhabdomyosarcoma (rd) cells (figures 2b and 2c). the mutant viruses (hev71d23a and hev71r34a) showed weaker growth patterns than did the wt virus (hev71wt) in rd and 293t cells (figure 2d), suggesting that the loss of vsr function probably contributes to the restriction of hev71 replication. the presence of readily detectable viral sirnas within infected cells has been recognized as a marker of antiviral rnai (ding, 2010). to determine if hev71 infection triggers the production of viral sirnas, total rnas were extracted from 293t cells infected with hev71wt at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 at 24 hr post-infection (hpi) and then subjected to deep sequencing. abundant viral small rnas (vsrnas), 18–28 nt in length, were detected in the hev71wt-infected 293t cells (figure 3a). these vsrnas failed to cluster as predicted 22 ± 1-nt dicer products (canonical sirnas) but instead were presented as predominantly nonspecific viral rna degradation products with random size distribution and an overwhelming bias for positive strands (97.38%) (table s1), similar to those observed in mammalian somatic cells infected by poliovirus and iav (kennedy et al., 2015; parameswaran et al., 2010). besides, a previous study by weng et al. identified several hev71wt-derived vsrnas that are cleavage products from the internal ribosome entry site (ires), that vary in size, and that lack sirna properties (weng et al., 2014), consistent with our observation. next, we infected 293t cells or a characterized dicer-deficient 293t cell line (nodice), whose all three copies of the dicer1 gene are inactivated by gene editing (bogerd et al., 2014b), with hev71d23a. of note, hev71d23a was used here because the d23a mutation was more efficient than r34a in eliminating the in vitro rnai suppression activity of 3a (figure 1g) and restricting hev71 replication in cells (figure 2d). as shown in figure 3a and table s1, although vsrnas detected in hev71d23ainfected cells were less abundant than those in hev71wtinfected cells, which were likely due to the greatly reduced mutant virus genomic rna, the positive-strand bias was substantial reduced (67.89%). moreover, vsrna reads in 22 ± 1-nt size were divided approximately equally into positive (59.95%) and negative strands (40.41%), revealing apparent peaks of vsrnas of both polarities (figure 3a). further bioinformatics analysis showed that the hev71d23a library was enriched for a population of 22-nt vsrnas that contained a 20-nt perfectly base-paired duplex region with 2-nt 30 overhangs (figure 3b, peak ‘‘2’’), which were not found in the vsrnas of hev71wt (figure 3b). together, these results show that a significant level of vsrnas with the properties of canonical sirnas were immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 995 produced in 293t cells infected with hev71d23a, and this finding was also confirmed by an independently repeated experiment (figures s2a and s2b). interestingly, when dicer is deficient by gene editing, far fewer vsrna reads were detected in in nodice 293t cells infected by hev71d23a (table s1), and the remaining vsrnas did not show any of the sirna properties observed in normal 293t cells infected with the same mutant virus (figure 3a and 3b), showing that the production of canonical viral sirnas is dicer-dependent. analysis of the genomic origin of vsrna reads predicted to form sirna duplexes (22-nt size) showed that hev71d23aderived sirnas were highly concentrated at the 50 termini of the hev71 genome (73.8% of total reads in 22-nt size) in the highly structured ires (figure 3c and figure s2c). notably, 94.9% of the negative-stranded vsrna reads in 22-nt size were derived from the terminal regions of antigenomic rnas (figure 3c). these terminal vsrna reads formed successive (or phased) complementary pairs of viral sirnas (figures 3d and 3e), and none of the reversed sequences of negative-strand vsrna reads from the terminal regions could be mapped to positive-stranded hev71 genomic rna (figure 3f) even when two nucleotide mismatches were allowed, showing that negative- stranded vsrna reads were derived from antigenomic rnas produced by viral rna replication. together, our results show that the viral sirnas in hev71d23a-infected 293t cells were predominantly derived from dicer processing of the termini of viral dsrna replicative intermediates, but not viral rna stem structures. production of abundant viral sirnas in human somatic cells infected with vsr-deficient hev71 we next sought to determine whether hev71-derived sirnas were abundant enough to be readily detectable by northern blot. discrete bands in the 21- to 22-nt size range were detected in 293t cells infected with hev71d23a (figure 4a, lanes 5–7) by using two different rna oligo probes complementary to two negative-stranded viral sirnas (marked by stars in figure 3e). the hev71d23a-derived sirnas also accumulated to high levels figure 2. the replication of 3a-deficient mutants of hev71 was inhibited (a) hev71 genome and the mutation sites of d23a and r34a of 3a.

(legend continued on next page) immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 997 in human rd cells (figure 4b, lanes 5 and 6). moreover, viral sirnas were also produced in rd cells infected with hev71r34a (figure 4b, lane 9). these results provide an independent verification of the production, size, and abundance of the deep-sequenced hev71-derived sirnas. in contrast to infection with 3a-deficient hev71, viral sirnas were undetectable in either 293t or rd cells infected with hev71wt (figure 4a, lanes 2–4; figure 4b, lanes 1–3), indicating that the biogenesis of the hev71-derived sirnas was suppressed by 3a expressed in cis from the viral genome, consistent with the results of deep sequencing (figure 3a). together, our findings show that hev71 3a does function as an authentic vsr in a viral infection context, and when the 3a-mediated suppression of rnai was genetically impaired in hev71,rnai response was effectively induced to produce readily detectable dicer-dependent viral sirnas in human somatic cells. rnai plays an antiviral role in human somatic cells upon confirming that rnai response could be triggered by infection of vsr-deficient hev71, but not wt hev71, we sought to determine if rnai plays an antiviral role in hev71-infected human somatic cells. to this end, human 293t or rd cells were infected with wt or vsr-deficient hev71, and viral rna accumulation, virus titer, virion production, and viral sirna production were determined. as expected, the viral rna accumulation and virion production of hev71d23a or hev71r34a were restricted in both 293t and rd cells (figures 5a, 5b, and s3a–s3d), consistent with the virus titer assays (figures 2d and s4a and s4b). correspondingly, significant amounts of viral sirnas, readily detected by northern blot, were produced in cells infected with hev71d23a or hev71r34a, but not hev71wt (figures 4a, 4b, 5b, and s3b). moreover, if rnai response is indeed antiviral, the rescue of vsr-deficient viruses should be observed in rnai-compromised cells (cullen et al., 2013). our data showed that viral rna replication and virion production of hev71d23a or hev71r34a were rescued by ectopic expression of nov b2 or hev71 3a, but not the vsr-deficient mutant of b2 (b2r59q, also termed ‘‘mb2’’) or 3a (3ad23a) (figures 5a, 5b and s3a–s3d). correspondingly, viral sirna biogenesis was blocked by ectopic expression of b2 or 3a, but not mb2 or 3ad23a (figures 5b and s3b, lanes 4–7). more importantly, the deficiency of dicer in 293t or rd cells efficiently rescued the replication of hev71d23a or hev71r34a (figures 5a, 5b, s3a–s3d, and s4a–s4d). as expected, dicer deficiency eliminated viral sirna production (figures 5b and s3b, lane 8), consistent with our deep sequencing data (table s1). therefore, our data show that vsr-deficient viruses can be rescued in (c) the distribution of vsrna reads (22-nt size) in the positive- and negative-stranded hev71 genome and the relative abundances of positive- and negativestranded vsrnas are indicated.

to rna-ip with anti-3a antibody. the precipitated rnas were treated in the presence or absence of rnase i or rnase iii and then detected by northern blotting using rna probes targeting positive- and negative-stranded hev71 genomic 1–700 nt. precipitated 3a and 3ab proteins were detected by western blots with anti-3a antibody. each experiment has been repeated at least three times independently.

additionally, ectopically expressing 3a moderately inhibited polyi:c-stimulated ifn-b induction in 293 cells stably expressing tlr3, comparing with the strong effect of ebov vp35, a wellknown ifn-i antagonist (figure s4g). besides, ectopic expression of 3a did not inhibit the induction of ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) (figure s4h). thus, hev71 3a has a minor inhibitory effect on ifn-i induction in cells. to exclude the potential interference of ifn-i response, we treated wt or nodice 293t cells infected by hev71d23a with ruxolitinib, a well-known jak1 and jak3 inhibitor (mesa et al., 2012), to block ifn-i response. we found that the rna accumulation of hev71d23a in ruxolitinib-treated dicer-deficient cells was significantly higher than that in ruxolitinib-treated wt cells (figure 5a), showing that the rescuing effect of compromising rnai on viral replication is independent of ifn-i response. interestingly, continuous culturing of hev71r34a resulted in two different spontaneous mutations, i.e., mutations to wt and valine (v), and hev71r34v exhibited similar plaque and growth patterns with hev71wt and did not trigger viral sirna production in rd cells (figure s5), showing that 3ar34v also has vsr activity. the rapid reverse mutations of hev71r34a are probably due to the pressure of natural selection, further confirming the importance of vsr in viral replication. together, our data show that rnai indeed functions as an antiviral immunity in an ifn-independent manner in human somatic cells. hev71-derived sirnas load into ago and are active to degrade cognate viral rna sequence in mammalian rnai pathway, sirnas mainly load into ago2, the only mammalian ago that exhibits cleavage activity, to guide the destruction of cognate rna (liu et al., 2004). to further confirm the antiviral role of virus-triggered rnai response, we first sought to determine if hev71-derived sirnas can load into ago-risc. after infection of 293t or rd cells by wt or mutant viruses, small rnas were subjected to rna-immunoprecipitation (rna-ip) with anti-pan ago antibody. our results showed that viral sirnas in cells infected by hev71d23a or hev71r34a were coimmunoprecipitated with ago (figures 5b and s3b, bottom; figure s3d, top). subsequently, we sought to determine if these hev71-derived sirnas are really able to specifically guide the degradation of cognate hev71 genomic rnas. because hev71 genomic rnas can self-replicate to generate viral dsrnas in infected cells, it is difficult to distinguish whether the clearance of hev71 rnas is mediated by sirna-guided ago cleavage of hev71 genomic rna or by dicer cleavage of hev71 dsrnas. to address this issue, we designed a plasmid that transcribes an mrna containing egfp orf followed by the sequences of 600–700 nt of the hev71 genome, named ‘‘egfp-hev71600–700.’’ this region of the hev71 genome contains no predicted rna secondary structure (figure s2c) and is complementary with a serial of viral sirnasproducedin cells infected withhev71d23a (figure4a). of note, the plasmid egfp-hev711200–1300, which was constructed using the same strategy but is not complementary with hev71-derived sirnas (figure 3c), was used as a negative control. in addition, the egfp-hev71600–700 and egfphev711200– 1300 mrnas are unable to generate dsrnas, making them potential targets for hev71-derived sirna-guided rnai, but not dicer-mediated cleavage. as shown in figure 5c, the mrna levels of egfp-hev71600–700 were substantially reduced by infection withhev71d23acompared to infection withhev71wt. bycontrast, neitherhev71d23a norhev71wt showed any effect in cells expressing egfp or egfp-hev711200–1300 (figure 5c, lanes 1–3 and 7–9). as expected, hev71d23a-infection cannot reduce egfp-hev71600–700 mrna level in nodice cells (figure 5c, lanes 10–12). in conclusion, hev71-derived sirnas indeed load into ago and are active to guide sequence-specific destruction of cognate viral rna sequence in a dicer-dependent manner. hev71 3a sequestrates viral dsrnas in infected cells upon confirming that rnai plays an antiviral role in human somatic cells, we sought to determine if the incapability of hev71wt to trigger rnai response and viral sirna production is indeed due to the vsr activity of 3a in an authentic viral infection context. to this end, we performed rna-ip with anti-3a antibody in the lysates prepared from 293t cells infected with hev71wt or hev71d23a. total rnas extracted from the inputs and the rna-ip products were subjected to northern blotting by using rna probes targeting positive- and negative-stranded hev71 genomes 1–700 nt. viral rnas of both polarities were readily detected in rna-ip products from 293t cells infected with hev71wt (figure 5d), while the complete viral genomic rnas were detected in inputs (figure s3e). the molecular weights of these viral rnas spanned a broad spectrum, possibly consisting of rna-ip-enriched replicative intermediates or degradation products (figure 5d, lane 2). moreover, the 3a-bound viral rnas were double-stranded, as they were susceptible to dsrna-specific rnase iii but resistant to ssrnaspecific rnase i (figure 5d). in addition, ectopically expressed 3a efficiently bound to viral rnas, which were also doublestranded, in cells infected with hev71d23a (figure 5d, lane 4), consistent with our findings that ectopic expression of 3a rescued viral replication and suppressed viral sirna biogenesis of vsr-deficient hev71. on the other hand, both virally and ectopically expressed 3ad23a barely associated with hev71 dsrnas in cells infected with hev71d23a (figure 5d, lanes 3 and 5). together, our data show that hev71 3a sequestrated viral dsrnas and could explain why virus-derived sirnas were barely detectable in human somatic cells infected with wt virus whose vsr activity is potent and intact. antiviral rnai restricts vsr-deficient hev71 replication in primary somatic cells and in mice we sought to expand our evaluation of viral sirna biogenesis and antiviral effects of rnai in primary somatic cells and animals. to this end, primary murine lung fibroblasts (mlfs) were isolated from 8- to 10-week-old wt or ifnar1/ c57/b6 mice and infected with wt or d23a hev71, respectively. our data showed that the vsr deficiency substantially restricted the viral replication and virion production of hev71 inwtor ifnar1/ mlfs at 12 or 24 hpi (figures 6a and 6b), consistent with our observations in human 293t and rd cells (figures 5 and s3). in addition, infection with hev71d23a triggered the production of hev71-derived sirnas, which were readily detectable via northern blotting, in 1000 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 figure 6. vsr-deficient hev71 triggers viral sirna

(e) groups of 1-day-old ifnar1/ a129 mice (n = 3) intracerebrally injected the same titer of the viruses as noted in (d) were dissected at 6, 24, 48, and 120 hpi. mouse brains were collected, homogenized, and then subjected to standard plaque assays for determining the viral titers. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 as measured by two-way anova (graphpad prism). (f) total rnas were extracted from the same mouse brain samples as noted in (e) and subjected to northern blotting with rna probes targeting positive- or negative-stranded hev71 genomic rnas, viral sirnas, mir-21, or u6. ten times more rnas were loaded for the detection of negative-stranded hev71 genomic rnas than for positive-stranded genomic rnas. 18 s rrna was used as loading controls. each experiment has been repeated at least three times independently. see also figure s6. immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 1001 wt or ifnar1/ mlfs (figures 6b and 6c), while hev71wt failed to do so (figures 6b and 6c). besides, our rna-ip assay revealed that viral sirnas produced in hev71d23a-infected mlfs also loaded into ago (figure 6b, lane 3, bottom). moreover, although ifn-b induction was moderately more enhanced by hev71d23a than by hev71wt in wt mlfs (figure s6c), consistent with our observation in 293t cells (figures s4e and s4f), the knockdown of dicer in either wt or ifnar1/ mlfs (figure s6a) efficiently rescued the replication of hev71d23a (figures 6a and s6b), further confirming that the antiviral role of rnai is independent of ifn-i response. besides, the dicer deficiency expectedly eliminated the production of viral sirnas in either cells (figure 6c). next, we determined the different antiviral responses against the wt and vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 in ifnar1/ a129 mice that lack ifn-i receptors. of note, the usage of ifnar1/ mice can exclude the potentially different effects of ifn-i response against the wt and mutant virus (goubau et al., 2013). groups of 1-day-old a129 mice were intracerebrally challenged with 13107 pfu of hev71wt or hev71d23a; and the mortalities of the infected mice were monitored for 2 weeks. as shown in figure 6d, the hev71wt-infected mice all died within 5 days, whereas the hev71d23a-infected mice all survived. mouse brains derived from hev71wt- or hev71d23a-infected a129 mice at 6, 24, 48, and 120 hpi were extracted, and the virus titers were determined, showing that the replication of hev71d23a was substantially restricted compared to that of hev71wt (figure 6e). additionally, although the positivestranded hev71 genomic rnas were accumulated at high levels at 24 hpi in the brains of hev71wt-infected mice (figure 6f, lane 1), they were accumulated at lower levels from 6–48 hpi and then reduced to an almost undetectable level at 120 hpi during hev71d23a infection (figure 6f, lanes 3–5). besides, negativestranded antigenomic rnas became readily detectable at 24 and 48 hpi of hev71d23a (figure 6f, lanes 3 and 4), showing that hev71d23a rnas replicated but were rapidly cleared in infected mice. furthermore, we found that the production of viral sirnas was triggered by infection of a129 mice with hev71d23a, but not hev71wt, at 24 and 48 hpi (figure 6f, lanes 3 and 4). the viral sirnas became undetectable at 120 hpi (figure 6f, lane 5), coinciding with the clearance of the replication products (i.e., genomic and antigenomic rnas) of hev71d23a (figure 6f, lane 5). in summary, our findings show that, similarly to that in human somatic cells, vsr-deficient hev71 triggered the production of readily detectable virus-derived sirnas, which was closely associated with viral clearance and dramatically reduced pathogenicity, in a dicer-dependent but ifn-independent manner both in primary mammalian somatic cells and mice. discussion it has been unclear whether infection by any mammalian viruses would induce and suppress antiviral rnai response in mammals, mostly because mammalian somatic cells infected by diverse wt mammalian rna viruses failed to produce readily detectable viral sirnas or only express very low levels of vsrnas that lack sirna properties and are likely random degradation products of viral genomic rnas. to solve this enigma, several possibilities have been proposed (cullen et al., 2013; kennedy et al., 2015; li et al., 2013). one possibility is that wt dicer expressed in mammalian somatic cells may lack the ability to produce sirnas from long dsrnas. this possibility is partly supported by previous findings that the n-terminal helicase domain of mammalian dicer plays an autoinhibitory role on its sirna processing activity (flemr et al., 2013; ma et al., 2008), and ectopic expression of an n-terminally truncated human dicer mutant could produce viral sirnas in human somatic cells infected by iav (kennedy et al., 2015). moreover, it has been suggested that undifferentiated murine cells, like mescs and oocytes, express an n-terminally truncated isoform of murine dicer (nejepinska et al., 2012; tam et al., 2008; watanabe et al., 2008), which may explain why mescs produced viral sirnas in response to emcv infection (maillard et al., 2013). however, these observations do not exclude the possibility that wt dicer retains some sirna producing ability. indeed, although the short dicer isoform is not naturally expressed in human or murine somatic cells, our data show that viral sirnas were produced abundantly in human or murine somatic cells and mice infected by vsr-deficient hev71, demonstrating that wt dicer is still able to process viral dsrnas into sirnas. it is noteworthy that our finding and the aforementioned possibility are not mutually exclusive, as the n-terminal domain may partially inhibit but not abolish sirna production, and such an autoinhibition of dicer may be regulated by viral or host factors. the other possibility is that in the context of viral infection, viruses encode vsrs as an immune evasion mechanism that suppresses viral sirna production in mammalian somatic cells. this possibility has been discussed (cullen et al., 2013; kennedy et al., 2015; li et al., 2013; maillard et al., 2013) and supported by recent studies in which readily detectable viral sirnas were observed in mammalian somatic cells infected with a b2-deficient nov or ns1-deleted iav (li et al., 2016; li et al., 2013). however, nov is an insect nodavirus, while iav ns1 is a well-characterized ifn antagonist, and ns1 deletion did not prevent iav from replicating and inducing disease and death in ifn-defective mice (garcı´a- sastre et al., 1998). thus far, the strongest evidence is the identification of hev71 3a as an authentic vsr. enteroviral 3a and its precursor 3ab are critical components of viral rna replication complex (teterina et al., 2011), while their exact functions in viral rna replication remain unclear (gao et al., 2015). we found that infection by vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 triggered the dicer-dependent production of viral sirnas in different human or murine somatic cells, as well as in vivo. moreover, during hev71 infection, virally expressed 3a did bind hev71 dsrnas in human somatic cells, while vsr-deficient 3a mutant failed to do so. interestingly, the vsr activity of 3a appears to be under high pressure of natural selection, as a vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 (hev71r34a) exhibited rapid spontaneous reverse mutations, further confirming the importance of vsr for hev71 replication. the production of abundant virus-derived sirnas clearly shows that viral dsrna replicative intermediates are indeed processed by dicer in mammals. however, these findings only provide compelling evidence, but not direct demonstration, of 1002 immunity 46, 992–1004, june 20, 2017 antiviral rnai in mammals, and extra evidence is required to show that virus-induced rnai does have antiviral activity: first, vsr-deficient viruses should be rescued by genetic ablation of key rnai component; second, viral sirnas should load into risc and be active to degrade cognate viral rnas. although previous studies using nov, emcv, or iav did not address this issue (li et al., 2016; li et al., 2013; maillard et al., 2013), our findings show that hev71-derived sirnas load into ago2-risc and are fully active to degrade cognate hev71 rna sequence and vsr-deficient mutant of hev71 is significantly restricted in human somatic cells, primary somatic cells and mice, while dicer deficiency successfully rescues mutant hev71 replication. in addition to being recognized by dicer, viral dsrnas are usually recognized by rig-i-mda5 and tlr3 to induce ifn-i responses against viral infection (goubau et al., 2013), and ifn-i response has been found to suppress rnai by inhibiting risc (maillard et al., 2016; seo et al., 2013). moreover, many vsrs such as nov b2 and iav ns1 are dsrna-binding proteins, and it remains unclear if the restricted replication and pathogenicity of mutant viruses are due to their inabilities to suppress viral sirna production or ifn response. we also observed that 3a has a minor ifn-i suppression activity in cells. to exclude the potential interference of ifn-i, mammalian somatic cells or mice that are unable to mount ifn-i responses need to be challenged by wt and vsr-deficient viruses (cullen et al., 2013). indeed, vsr-deficient hev71 triggered the production of readily detectable viral sirnas in ifnar1/ mlfs and mice, and correspondingly, the replication and pathogenicity of the mutant virus were also dramatically restricted. in addition, when ifn-i response was blocked, the genetic ablation of dicer still rescued the replication of vsr-deficient hev71 both in vitro and ex vivo. thus, 3a does protect hev71 from antiviral rnai independently of ifn response in mammals. in conclusion, our findings demonstrate that hev71 expresses protein 3a as vsr to effectively suppress the production of virally derived sirnas and antiviral rnai immunity in human somatic cell lines, murine primary somatic cells, and mice. to our best knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the production of readily detectable virus-derived sirnas by wt dicer in an ifn-independent manner in vivo, and our study further shows that these viral sirnas have antiviral activity by loading into risc and specifically silencing cognate viral rna sequence. in addition, it uncovers for the first time the detailed mechanism by which a human positive-stranded rna virus acts to evade antiviral rnai both in vitro and in vivo. based upon the data presented here and in previous studies, either enhancing the activity of the rnai pathway or directly targeting vsrs like hev71 3a may be promising strategies to develop novel antiviral therapies, and rnai should function as an important antiviral immunity against more rna viruses that include many important emerging and reemerging human pathogens, therefore representing an exciting avenue for future studies. star+methods detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: d key resources table d contact for reagent and resource sharing d experimental model and subject details b cell culture b virus b mice d method details b plasmids and rnas b construction and recovery of hev71 mutant viruses b virus infection, plaque assays and ifa b rna extraction, northern blotting and qrt-pcr b western blotting b crispr/cas9 knockout b expression and purification of recombinant proteins, gel shift and in vitro dicer cleavage assays b rna-ip b deep sequencing and data analysis b mouse experiments d quantification and statistical analysis d data and software availability supplemental information supplemental information includes six figures and two tables and can be found with this article online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2017. 05.006. author contributions y.q. and y.x. performed experiments with the help of h.z., y.-q.d., x.-f.l., f.-c.z., andm.m.;

maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) (gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (gibco), 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37c in a humidified atmosphere with5%co2. the nodice 293t cell line (bogerd et al., 2014b) was generously provided by dr. bryan r. cullen (durham, nc, usa). the 293-tlr3 cell line (lei et al., 2010) was generously provided by dr. hong-bing shu (wuhan, china). the drosophila s2 cells were cultured in at 27c in schneider’s insect medium (gibco) supplemented with 10% fbs (gibco). primary mlfs were isolated from wt or ifnar1/ c57/b6 mice as described (zhang et al., 2016). briefly, lungs were minced and digested in calcium- and magnesium-free hank’s balanced salt solution (hbss) buffer (thermo) supplemented with 10 mg/ml type ii collagenase (worthington) and 20 mg/ml dnase i (sigma-aldrich) for 3 hr at 37c with shaking. cell suspensions were filtered through progressively smaller cell strainers (100 and 40 mm). filtered cells were plated in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. one hour later, adherent fibroblasts were rinsed with hbss and cultured for the subsequent experiments. for knockdown of dicer, wt or ifnar1/ mlfs were transfected with two different pairs of sirnas (sidicer#1 and sidicer#2) targeting the orf of mouse dicer gene, respectively. two days after transfection, mlfs were reseeded and then infected with wt or mutant viruses, respectively. the nucleotide sequences of dicer sirnas were shown in table. s2. virus hev71 strain h (vr-1432) were obtained from atcc, and amplified in rd cells. mice the 129/sv/ev mice deficient in ifn-a/b receptor (a129 mice) were kindly provided by dr. qi-bin leng (shanghai,china) (li et al., 2017). mice were specific pathogen free and maintained under a 12 hr light/dark cycle with standard chow diet. all animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the guidelines of the chinese regulations of laboratory animals (ministry of science and technology of china) and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at beijing institute of microbiology and epidemiology. method details plasmids and rnas for the reversal-of-silencing assay in mammals, the plasmid pegfp-c1 was used to express the enhanced green fluorescent (egfp) protein. hev71 viral proteins were cloned into mammalian expression vector prk-flag (kindly provided by dr. hong-bing shu, wuhan, china). mutations were introduced into the hev71 3a coding region by pcr-mediated mutagenesis, with appropriate primers containing the desired nucleotide changes (table s2). for rnai suppression assays in drosophila s2 cells, the egfp reporter gene and the fhv b2 were constructed into the insect expressing vector pac5.1/v5-hisb as previously described (qi et al., 2012). hev71 3a protein orf fragment was cloned into pac5.1/v5-hisb vector. the sirnas targeting human dicer and ago2 were synthesized by ribobio (guangzhou, china). full-length cdna of fhv rna1 and rna1-db2 (t2739c and c2910a) encoded in cuso4- induced pmt vector were kindly provided by dr. shou-wei ding (riverside, ca, usa). the 400-nt dsrna for egfp silencing in s2 cells and the 500-nt dsrnas for knockdown of dicer-2 and ago2 of s2 cells were generated by in vitro transcription. plasmids for the purification of mbp fusion protein 3a were constructed by inserting 3a orf into pmal-c2x vector. construction and recovery of hev71 mutant viruses d23a and r34a mutations in 3a were introduced into the infectious hev71 cdna clone (hev71 strain vr1432, agt18270) by pcrmediated site-directed mutagenesis. the positive clones confirmed by sequencing were linearized by mlu i, and then subjected to in vitro transcription by using sp6 rna polymerase (promega). rna transcripts were then transfected into rd cells with lipofectamine 3000, and rescued viruses were harvested 1 to 2 days after transfection. viruses were concentrated by amicon ultra-15 filters (millipore) and the titers of viruses were measured by plaque assays. virus infection, plaque assays and ifa at the day of infection, the medium was changed with dmem without fbs and viruses added at an moi of 10 on 50%–70% confluent rd, 293t cells or mlfs cultured in 6-wells plates or 15-cm2 dishes. cells were incubated for 1 hr to allow adsorption, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and then the complete medium was added. for the rescue experiments, cells were first transfected with the empty prk-flag vector or prk-flag vector encoding b2, mb2, 3a or 3ad23a, respectively. two day after transfection, the cells were subjected to selection with g418 (200 mg/ml) (invivogen) for 48 hr and then re-plated for infection. plaque assays were performed on rd cells in 12-well plates infected with a 10-fold serial dilution of viruses. the plates were incubated at 37c for 1 hr to allow adsorption. then the supernatant was removed, and cells were overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose (sigma-aldrich) in dmem containing 2% fbs. after further incubation at 37c for 4 days, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet to visualize the plaques. immunity 46, 992–1004.e1–e5, june 20, 2017 e3 for ifa, rd cells were seeded in 60-mm-diameter culture dishes containing a 1-cm2 coverslip inside were infected with viruses at an moi of 10. at 24 hpi, the coverslips containing infected cells were removed and directly used for ifa analysis. the cells on the coverslip were fixed with ice-cold acetone and incubated with primary anti-vp1 antibody at 37c for 1 hr. cells were washed three times with pbs and then incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse igg antibody conjugated to alexa fluor 488 (abcam) in pbs for 40 min at 37c. rna extraction, northern blotting and qrt-pcr for egfp mrna detection, total rnas were extracted using trizol reagent (thermo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for the samples required for detection of both viral sirnas and viral genomic rnas, small rna-enriched total rnas were isolated using the mirneasy mini kit (qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for northern blot analysis of high-molecularweight (hmw) rna, 5 mg of total rnas were resolved on denaturing 1.5% agarose gels with 2.2mformaldehyde, capillary transferred to hybond-a nylon membrane (ge healthcare). equal loading was verified before transfer by ethidium bromide staining of total rna within the rna gels. for northern blot analysis of low-molecular-weight (lmw) rna, 20 mg of small rna-enriched total rnas were resolved on 7 m urea-15% page, transferred to hybond-a nylon membrane (ge healthcare) and chemically cross-linked using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (edc) as previously described (kim et al., 2010). the probe for detection of egfp mrna was complementary to the 500-720 nt of egfp orf region. the probes for detection of hev71 genomic rnas were complementary to the 1-700 nt of hev71 genome of both polarities. these rna probes were labeled with dig-utp (roche) by in vitro transcription. for detection of small rnas, dig-labeled oligo rna probes targeting egfp sirna, viral sirnas (vsirnas), mir-92a, mir-21 and u6 were synthesized by takara. qrt-pcr was performed with the primers targeting egfp orf or hev71 genome. all the primers and oligonucleotides used here are shown in table s2. western blotting cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer [50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl, 1% np40, 0.25% deoxycholate and a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche)], and the lysates were then subjected to 10% (figure s1a) or 15% (the other figures) sds-page and western blotting. the anti-3a polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against peptide gppkfkpikisleec (genscript antibody service, nanjing, china). crispr/cas9 knockout the dicer crispr/cas9 ko plasmid (sc-400365, santa cruz biotech) was used to knockout dicer gene in human rd cells according to manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, after transfection with the crispr/cas9 ko plasmids, rd cells were allowed for cultured for 3 days and then selected by puromycin (10 mg/ml) (invivogen). the resulting clones were confirmed by dna-sequencing and western blotting. expression and purification of recombinant proteins, gel shift and in vitro dicer cleavage assays for expression and purification of recombinant mbp-fusion proteins, mbp-3a and its mutants as well as the negative control protein mbp were expressed in e. coli strain tb1 at 27c in the presence of 0.2 mm iptg. cell pellets were resuspended in binding buffer [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 200 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1.5% triton x-100 and a protease inhibitors cocktail (roche). cells were lysed by sonication and then debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 11,000 3 g. the proteins in the supernatant were purified using amylose resin (new england biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and concentrated using amicon ultra-15 filters (millipore). all proteins were quantified via a uv-visible spectrophotometer (shimadzu). for gel shift assay, mbp-fusion proteins (0.5 to 16 mm) was incubated with 0.1 mmof dig-labeled 200-nt dsrna probe in a binding buffer [50 mm hepes (ph 8.0), 15 mm nacl, 0.5 mm mgcl2, 10% glycerol and 1 u of rnase inhibitor (promega)] at 37c for 30 min; the total volume was 10 ml. for competition assays, 2 mm of mbp-3a was incubated with 0.1 mm dig-labeled dsrna and increasing amounts (0.2-5 mm) of unlabeled dsrna or ssrna. after the binding reaction, the samples were analyzed via 6% native-page in 0.5 3 tbe buffer in a cold room and transferred to hybond-a nylon membrane (ge healthcare). the membranes were incubated for 30 min with anti-dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (roche). the rna probe representing the egfp nt 1-200 was labeled with dig-utp (roche) for in vitro transcription. for the in vitro dicer cleavage assay, 0.4 mg of 200-nt dsrna was incubated with 0.5 u of a recombinant human dicer enzyme (t510002, genlantis) and mbp-fusion proteins (1 and 10 mm) in a reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer at 37c for 16 hr. the dicer-treated rnas were purified from the reaction complex by using trizol reagent (thermo) and then separated on 7 m urea-15% page; the rnas were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. rna-ip rna-ip was performed as previously described (qi et al., 2012) with minor modification. briefly, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 200 mm nacl, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5% triton x-100, 0.5 u/ml rnase inhibitor (promega) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche)]. after centrifugation, the postnuclear lysates were pre-cleared via incubation with protein-a/g agarose beads (roche) together with goat anti-mouse igg at 4c for 4 hr. then the pre-cleared lysates were incubated with antibodies e4 immunity 46, 992–1004.e1–e5, june 20, 2017 (anti-pan ago2 or anti-3a) together with protein-a/g agarose beads (roche) at 4c for 12 hr. the antibody-bound complexes were washed for five times with the same lysis buffer except that nacl concentration was raised to 600 mm. finally, rnas or proteins were extracted from the complexes and subjected to northern or western blotting as noted above. for detecting the 3a-bound rnas, the rnas in complexes were extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then treated with rnase i or rnase iii (new england biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol before they were subjected to northern blotting. deep sequencing and data analysis libraries of small rnas from cell culture were constructed using truseq small rna library preparation kits (illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. the libraries were sequenced by illumina hiseq 2000 at ribobio. the sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (release hg19) by using bowite 2.2.5 and the cellular mirna expression level was determined on the basis of the number of reads that was identical to the annotated mirna sequences in mirbase version 18, only allowing 2 or +2 nt to be templated by the corresponding genomic sequence at the 30 end. viral small rna (vsrna) reads which cannot be mapped to human genome were then mapped to hev71 genome with 100% identity. the subsequent analysis of length and location of these vsrnas were calculated using in-house perl scripts. pairs of complementary 22-nt vsrnas in each library in different distance categories were computed using principles as previously described (li et al., 2016; li et al., 2013). mouse experiments groups of 1-day-old a129 mice (n = 5) were inoculated by the intracerebrally injected with 13107 pfu of viruses. animals were monitored for 15 days after inoculation. any mice found in a moribund condition were euthanatized and scored as dead. in addition, groups of 1-day-old a129 mice (n = 3) intracerebrally injected with 1 3 107 pfu of viruses were dissected at 6, 24, 48, and 120 hpi. mouse brains were collected, homogenized and diluted with pbs to make final 10% (w/v) suspensions. the viremia were measured by plaque assay. quantification and statistical analysis graphpad prism was used for all statistical analyses. all experiments were repeated at least three times. statistical analysis was carried out by unpaired t test or two-way anova (graphpad prism). p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. data and software availability the rna-seq data has been deposited to the ncbi geo database under the accession number geo: gse99252. immunity 46, 992–1004.e1–e5, june 20,
