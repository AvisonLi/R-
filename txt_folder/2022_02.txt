Smart and precise sensing is very important for the protection of both environment and personal security in
modern civilized society. There are numerous sensing devices for detecting physical and chemical changes such
as temperature, humidity, pressure, and chemical species. In this regard, conducting polymers is at the core of
attention for the fabrication of next-generation sensor applications. Polypyrrole (PPy), is one of the emerging
intelligent materials with a wide range of applications in the field of optical, electronic, and electrochromic
devices and sensors. The stability in a different environment, ease of deposition from aqueous and non-aqueous
media, adherence to diverse substrates, and high electrical conductivity made PPy a unique choice for sensor
development. In recent years, PPy has proven an excellent candidate for sensing volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) due to its selectivity and sensitivity towards target gas molecules, and detection of inorganic gases and
VOCs. Consequently, to develop outstanding sensing devices attempts have been dedicated to developing PPybased
sensors for excellent mechanical and electrochemical performance. This review aims to provide a recent
overview of progress in PPy-based advanced sensing devices. This review aims to provide a recent overview of
progress in PPy-based advanced sensing devices. We have systematically discussed the challenges and future
development of various sensing devices. Furthermore, the current understanding and performance evaluation of
gas sensing mechanisms in PPy-based sensors are discussed theoretically and experimentally. We have also
identified gaps in the state-of-the-art and hope that this study would lead to further research works into using
PPy to make gas sensors. Finally, the future directions of various sensors with advanced PPy-based sensing
systems have been prospected.

1. Introduction
With the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems
like sensors are increasingly used in the industry to improve all
types of accurate inspections [1]. The sensors are used to ensure safety
through continuous monitoring of aircraft maintenance, data loading
and relaying on icing conditions, and continuous monitoring. The sensors
increase the ability to depend on functional complexity and observe
the world around us [2]. In almost all cases, human beings have been
created to work to make their lives more accessible and better. Setting
the mood, switching conventional heat pump water heaters, ensuring
safety, tracking devices, and much more [3]. The specific inputs can be
motion, humidity, pressure, light, heat, or any other environmental
phenomena [4]. There are different kinds of sensors that are generally
used to detect any change in various applications and utilize novel
techniques to detect physical and chemical parameters [5]. Most of the
sensors are used for measuring physical properties like temperature,
resistance, capacitance, conduction, heat transfer, etc. However, some
sensors are also used to find the thermal and mechanical properties,
wettability, and electrical conductivity [6]. Our daily life encounters
different sensors such as temperature (e.g., IR (infrared sensors)) [7],
proximity (e.g., touch sensors, position sensors) [8–10], motion (e.g.,
accelerometer sensors, rotation position sensors) [11,12], light [13,14],
ultrasonic [15], heat [16], force/ pressure [17], humidity [18,19],
sound [20], PIR [21,22], strain and weight [23,24], electric current
[25], magnetic [26], gas and smoke [27,28] etc. and a myriad of other
uses are shown in (Fig. 1) [29,30]. Furthermore, sensors and artificial
intelligence (AI) can instantly alert physicians and patient visitors when
they fail to sanitize their hands before entering the hospital room. AI
tools can be built into smart homes, and technology can covertly
monitor frail elderly for behavioral cues of an impending health crisis
[31].
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a kind of primary pollutants
and highly reactive organic compounds [32]. VOCs are compounds with
high vapor pressure and low water solubility. Many VOCs are man-made
chemicals used and manufactured in refrigerants, pharmaceuticals, and
paints. Certain VOCs are suspected or proven carcinogens [33]. It is
released as a gas from particular liquids or solids [34]. For example,
commonly VOCs may be used in our daily life such as 1,3-butadiene
[C4H6], formaldehyde [CH2O], benzene [C6H6], ethylene glycol
[C2H6O2], toluene [C7H8], dichloromethane (DCM) [CH2Cl2], xylene
[C8H10], and tetrachloroethylene [C2Cl4] [35,36]. VOCs contain a range
of chemicals, some of which may have long- and short-term adverse
health effects. The concentration of many VOCs is typically ten (10)
times higher indoors than outdoors [37]. VOCs can cause serious health
problems in humans when absorbed or inhaled through the skin.
Exhaust streams, aerosols, and solvents employed in unventilated areas
can produce dangerous toxins [38]. Humans may experience dizziness,
memory loss, headaches, and visual disturbances if exposed to large
amounts. Exposure to high-level VOCs may cause a variety of health
effects, including throat discomfort, and nose and eye irritation [39].
Some compounds can cause even cancer in animals, as well as some
suspected, are cause to cancer in humans. Also, VOCs damage the kidneys,
liver, or central nervous system and nausea, dyspnea, loss of coordination,
allergic skin reaction, conjunctival irritation, headache, and
declines in serum cholinesterase levels, and emesis [39,40]. Volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) are responsible for scent odors and perfume
odors, as well as pollutants [41]. VOCs play an important role in the
formation of ground-level ozone (O3) and fine particles in the atmosphere.
Under sunlight, VOCs react primarily with nitrogen oxides
(NOx) emitted from vehicles, power plants, and industrial activities to
create ozone (O3), which in turn contributes to the formation of fine
particles [42]. Moreover, VOCs also actively participated in the
communication between plants and animals, such as attractants for
preventing predation, pollinators, and even interactions between plants
[43].
The sensors can give remarkable signals with low energy consumption
and offer excellent performance with even simple device configurations
[44,45]. Conductivity change is the most frequently used
property in a polypyrrole (PPy)-based sensors. It has been reported that
conductivity enhancement is observed in the reason of PPy-based sensors
towards the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) [46], carbon dioxide
(CO2) [47], nitrogen dioxide (NO2) [48,49], hydrogen (H2) [50],
hydrogen chloride (HCl) [51,52], hydrogen sulfide (H2S) [53], 2,
4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid/ ethanoic acid (C8H6Cl2O3) [54]. In
contrast, the conductivity reduction of the NH3 analyte has been reported.

[C3H9O3P]-based sensors also work on conductivity enhancement
against common analyte gases. However, the trend is more complicated
in the case of PPy which is increased and enhancement also reduction in
conductivity reported against NH3 and H2S analytes [55,56]. PPy has a
good conductivity for different analysts as NH3, NO2, H2S, H2, CO, CO2,
HCl, CH3COOH, and Dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) at room
temperature [57–62]. Therefore, the situation of PPy depends on the
specific reason and step-by-step basis (Table 1). All the mechanisms
mentioned in Table 1 can be considered as PPy sensing mechanisms. The
PPy sensors demonstrate excellent performance in terms of selectivity,
good stability, reproducibility, and immunity to humidity. PPy has
shown good conductivity (experimental 2000 S.cm-1 and theoretical
7600 S.cm-1) chrematistics in comparison with the other polymers such
as polythiophene (PTh) (experimental 100 S.cm-1 and theoretical 169 S.
cm-1) according to Table 2 [65]. It also shows a high, fast, and opposite
reaction. These sensors facilitate meeting the specifications of the actual
practical applications [60]. PPy has received much attention or use in
the fabrication of gas sensors [66-69]. It is due to their reasonable
excellent mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and low cost. From
the literature survey, we have observed that in the case of NH3 molecules
conductivity increases [60]; NO2 molecule’s conductivity increases
[61]; H2S, H2, CO, CO2, HCl, CH3COOH molecule’s conductivity
increases [57–59]; all of these make them the chemical sensors use by
PPy for exploring gas sensing applications.
In the following, we will be discussing the use of PPy to detect toxic
gases such as carbon monoxide (CO) [70], Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) [57],
and carbon dioxide (CO2) [71], and VOCs (e.g., methanol [CH3OH],
ethanol [C2H5OH], chloroform [CHCl3], toluene [C7H8], and n-hexane
[C6H14]), as shown in (Table 3) [72–79]. One of the famous VOCs is
methanol. It is a toxic gas, with a variety of use in industry, as a solvent,
in the synthesis of other organic chemicals, as an additive to gasoline,
etc. Many sensing materials such as oxide semiconductors, nano-thin
films, electronic conductometry, and direct spectroscopic techniques
have been explored earlier for the detection of methanol. Some PPy, are
also reported as potential materials for sensing methanol vapor. The
monomer and polymerized form of the PPy are shown in (Fig. 2). The
effects of side-chain lengths on sensing features and characteristics of
PPy are also duly pointed out, and their emerging application for gas
sensing is presented.
This review includes focuses on complementary aspects of both
theory and experiments on PPy-based sensors. The systematic exposition
of doping, surface modification chain selection, and PPy-chainarrangements
is also new. In addition, the tables and discussions given
herein on all reported families of conducting polymers (CPs) and their
current utilities will help a wide spectrum of researchers. Furthermore,
the gaps identified will enable the further activity of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs). In summary, we come up with the idea of writing a
new review in this field because researchers face many challenges when
working with PPy-based sensors. In addition, when we read and watch
research articles, we need to remember important points and find out
the research gaps. That’s why the information in this review is most
important, as it contains all current research related to these regions and
is used to gather new knowledge and skills about different sensors like
gas sensors, flexible sensors, electrochemical sensors, optical sensors,
etc. using PPy. Moreover, the aim of this review is to create readability
and to fill the knowledge gap in the best resources available in the
literature. Furthermore, this review paper is needed to clarify the state of
knowledge, determine the necessity of research, explain the obvious
contradictions, and even reach a consensus in places that did not even
exist before. Therefore, this review will be helpful for all researchers
working in this field.
2. Synthesis and recent modification strategies of PPy
PPy was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization technique
using pyrrole monomer (C4H4NH) in an aqueous solution for 4 h
at room temperature [80]. After synthesis, PPy is very difficult to process
because it is non-thermoplastic, brittle, rigid, non-degradable, and
insoluble in common solvents. It is an oxidized form of a positively
charged P-type conducting polymer that loses conductivity and becomes
charged when over-oxidized [81]. It has low mechanical strength and is
insulating in its neutral state. However, we found from the literature
survey that the PPy-modified electrode enhanced the electron transport
efficiency, thus enhancing the electron utilization efficiency of microorganisms,
thereby improving the denitrification performance of the
system [82]. In addition, we also found from literature surveys, FT-IR
spectroscopy, and elemental analysis that it is proportional to the solubility
of the precursor polymers in organic solvents. In this case, the
PPy(SO3H)-DEHS powder has shown maximum solubility in water
(~4% (w/v)) and a film conductivity of ~5 × 10–1 S/cm [83].
The surface changes of PPy result in improving gas sensitivity [84].
Surface modification is generally divided into two categories: physical
and chemical [85]. So far, wet chemical treatments [86] and
organo-silanization [87] approaches have been used for surface modification
of PPy. Besides, carbon-doped PPy has been reported wherein
electronic properties are well-tuned, which in turn leads to enhanced gas
sensitivity. Specifically, carbon doping increases the electron mass
transfer from the valence to the conduction band [88]. The phenomenon
results in efficient electronic interaction between the conductive surface
and target molecules of a desirable sensitivity [89]. PPy is also suitable
for sensing NH3 analytes [90], hence it is employed in gas sensors for
detection of the same. The interaction between PPy and gas analyte can
be rather strong even at room temperature (this is unlike the case for
sensors made of oxide semiconductors) [91].
3. Role of PPy sensitivity towards inorganic gases and VOCs
It has been continuously reported that some PPy demonstrates good
sensing performance for the detection of VOCs. Moreover, these PPy has
shown lower detection limits and proper working competence under
ambient conditions which is mainly due to their conductivity nature.
PPy-based sensors are sensitive to gas molecules such as acetone,
alcohol, benzene, toluene, and many biological species [92]. However,
both the sensitivity and selectivity of PPy to analytes vary significantly
with the environment [93,94]. Among the various CPs, PPy is intrinsically
better for the detection of VOCs, due to its superior electronic and
ionic conductivity and also its chemical steadiness. Doping PPy with
relevant secondary elements can enhance its sensitivity toward VOCs
detection [95]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the performances of
PPy are often hampered by atmospheric moisture. For example, it is
reported that PPy’s sensitivity towards CO and VOCs decreases by a
certain percentage (40%, 60%, or 80%) with an increase in the moisture
concentration (4–70%) [96,97]. This suggests that the sensitivity of
PPy-based sensors depends on environmental factors, including humidity,
temperature, and incident light [98].
The PPy and its composites are found to be better sensing materials
for some VOCs for example methanol [99], chloroform [100], and
ammonia [101,102]. The density-functional theory (DFT) is a computational
quantum-mechanical (QM) modeling approach used in the area

of chemistry, physics, and materials science to calculate the electronic or
nuclear structure (mainly the ground state) of multi-body systems,
especially atoms, molecules, and solids [103]. DFT and time-dependent
DFT (TD-DFT) calculations are used to study the doping and undoping
processes of PPy, i.e., the tunable nature of PPy. Jayasundara et al. have
reported that in the case of nPy, P-doping leads to increased conductivity,
but decreased bandgap and resistance. Whereas in the case of
nPy+27 the reverse trend is observed in terms of n-doping or reduction
[104]. In the following section we will be discussing the PPy for NO2
detection; PPy for CO and CO2 detection; and PPy for VOCs detection.
3.1. Role of PPy for NO2 detection
In general, Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) poisoning is harmful to all kinds
of life, such as chlorine gas poisoning and carbon monoxide (CO)
poisoning. It is easily absorbed by the lungs and its inhalation can cause
heart failure and sometimes death in severe cases [104]. Also, Nitrogen
oxides (NO2, N2O3, N2O4, and N2O5) can irritate the upper respiratory
tract and lungs even at low concentrations. Just one or two breaths of
very high concentrations can cause severe toxicity. For acute exposure,
the odor is usually a sufficient precautionary property [105]. Finally,
PPy is important to many industries because it can detect nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) accurately and quickly to avoid the gas reaching dangerously
toxic levels. PPy sensing films exhibit highly selective and
sensitive detection of NO2 at ppm level. PPy-based sensors show good
reproducibility (99%) and 55% stability [106,107]. Recently, it has been
reported that PPy-based sensors can be used to detect NO2. It is found
that PPy exhibits appreciable sensitivity towards NO2 gas [108]. Also,
PPy-based sensors for NO2 detection have offered the advantages of high
sensitivity, selectivity, short recovery time, cost viability, and low
detection limit. These are achieved due to various morphologies of PPy
[109]. In particular, mesoporous films of PPy are found to be helpful
[110,111].
3.2. Role of PPy for CO and CO2 detection
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a chemical compound that contains one
carbon atom and one oxygen atom and is also a colorless, and odorless

gas. Unlike carbon dioxide (CO2), it is completely man-made and does
not exist naturally in the atmosphere [112,113]. Carbon dioxide (CO) is
an important greenhouse gas that helps trap heat in our atmosphere.
Without it, our planet would be incredibly cold [114]. It is important to
install CO alarms on every floor of your home so that all family members
can hear the detectors and receive emergency alerts. You should also
install CO detectors in every bedroom, sleeping area, and common room
to provide extra safety while you and your family are sleeping [115].
However, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere
have caused average global temperatures to rise, disrupting
other aspects of the Earth’s climate [116]. In addition, the detection of
the two gases is different because CO2 detectors typically use infrared
sensors, while CO identification uses electrochemical sensors. However,
CO can also be detected using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensing
[117]. Furthermore, depending on the availability of oxygen (O), the
combustion reaction can produce both carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon
dioxide (CO2). Inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) competes with oxygen
(O) for binding to hemoglobin, depriving the organs of oxygen,
which can lead to death [118].
The PPy offers advantages such as fast response, cost viability, and
low power requirements during CO detection. In fact, miniature CO gas
sensor devices have been realized [119]. However, the technique
employed for the fabrication of devices has an essential role. For
instance, techniques that give rise to stable PPy and protect the physicochemical
properties (charge transport, morphology, surface area, and
porosity) of the PPy are considered to be advantageous for CO detection
[120]. According to the literature survey, we have found PPy is not a
good sensor for CO, while it is a good one for VOC.
3.3. Role of PPy for VOCs capturing
In this review, we discuss different aspects of gas sensors and VOCs
sensors, which are made employing conducting polymers such as PPy,
polyaniline (PANI), poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and
polythiophene (PTh), as well as their heterogeneous species with metals,
metal oxide nanostructures and nanocarbons (carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
reduced graphene oxide (rGO)), are used as active layers [121–123].
The PPy exhibits better sensitivity to ethanol when compared with
the doped thin film sensors. Its response and stability were previously
studied [124]. Among conducting polymers, PPy has been widely reported
for the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Commercially, VOC sensors find use in photo-ionized detectors (PID),
electronic noses, and sensor arrays [125]. Besides, PPy has been shown
to have high sensitivity to ethanol [C2H5OH], acetone [C3H6O],
isoprene [C5H8], and isopropanol [C3H8O] at room temperature. PPy
thus has several desirable characteristics relevant to the detection of
different kinds of VOCs [126]. The CdTe/PPy nanocomposites were
synthesized and integrated into love wave (L SAW) sensors and exhibit
high sensitivity to acetone with an estimated LOD of 5 ppb. For
increased sensitivity is related to the adsorption of acetone on PPy
through dipole-dipole interactions and the incorporation of CdTe into
the indicator /sensitive L SAW layer enhances sensor performance
[127].
Polyaniline (PANI) is a highly conductive polymer. Due to its unique
properties, easy synthesis, low cost, and high environmental stability, it
has reached widespread attention in various applications such as electronics,
pharmaceuticals, and anti-corrosion materials [128]. The electrical
conductivity of PANI-based compositions can be tightly controlled
over a wide range. For pure PANI compositions, conductivity levels up to
100 S/cm can be achieved. For polymer blends comprising PANI compositions,
a full range of conductivity levels from less than
10–10–10–1 S/cm (melt processing) and 10 S/cm (solution processing)
can be achieved [129]. An important advantage is that the classical high
permeation threshold for the onset of conductivity observed in spherical
carbon black-filled plastics does not exist [130]. Plasticized PANI compositions
improve the efficiency of molten processing by reducing
melting-viscosity, lowering the processing temperature, and shortening
the processing time. Improved molten flow features and characteristics
make complex-shaped injection molding easier [131].
Similarly, the conducting polymers (e.g., PPy and PANI) have been
fabricated for the detection of VOCs. PPy and PANI thin sensors have
achieved higher sensitivity compared to thick ones owing to 1-minute
undoped. PPy exhibited positive sensitivity while PANI has negative
sensitivity. After gas absorption, the sensitivity increases with the polarity
of the absorbing molecules [132]. It has also been found that the
CP sensor was very sensitive to the polarity of gas molecules. Nevertheless,
nearly all types of CPs show similar sensing mechanisms in the
detection of VOC gases wherein bipolar on or free carrier moves and
localizes on their surface [133] due to the adsorption of the gases. VOC
sensors have been found for use in healthcare (e.g., asthma, cancer),
safety, environmental monitoring, food and agriculture (e.g., affecting
ecosystem & plant growth development), and the oil industry. Moreover,
VOCs appear to detect hybrid nanomaterials with desired properties
such as limit of detection, superior sensitivity, synergist effects,
and developed performance of VOC sensors, as shown in (Fig. 3) [134,
135]. This is known to cause a change in the resistance to indicate gas
detection.
We have found from the literature survey, PPy is better than poly
(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The alcohol sensing behaviors
of PEDOT and PPy nanostructures for methanol, ethanol, propanol, and
butanol are investigated, and the sensing mechanisms of these systems
are discussed [136]. Both the PEDOT and PPy systems are able to detect
very low alcohol concentrations (down to 3 ppm) and exhibit linear
behavior with fast response/recovery performance, especially in the
case of ethanol vapor [137]. Compared to PEDOT, The PPy-based sensors
showed better cyclability in response to PEDOT when exposed to an
ethanol atmosphere. The surface properties of PEDOT and PPy-sensitive
layers were investigated by atomic force microscopy. Ultraviolet-visible
spectroscopy was used to study the effects of alcohol exposure on the
electrical transport properties of nanostructured PEDOT and PPy layers
[138]. When comparing the sensitivity of them and have been controlled
temperature. Frequently, PPy shows better sensitivity when compared
to PEDOT-based sensors, as shown in (Table 4).
In short, we have summarized data of PPy-based VOC sensors with
sensitivity, detection range, and limit of detection (LOD) and compared
them with other micro/nano-materials [139–148], as shown in
(Table 5).
4. Computational studies on gas sensing mechanisms of PPy
Theoretical calculations, especially density functional theory (DFT)
approaches, have been a useful approach to identifying the physical
properties, sensing characteristics, and molecular charge of polymers,
especially PPy [149-153]. DFT models allow the determination of
charge transfer and complex formation when PPy interfaces with gas
analytes. These calculations have shown that the electronic structure of
PPy offers excellent gas sensors for the detection of CO2, SO2, CO, H2O,
NH3, and CH4. They were considered to enhance gas sensitivity along
with selectivity by using the B3LYP/ 6–31 G(d) level of theory [154].
Computational approaches such as Quantum Espresso (QE) and Vienna
Ab initio simulation package (VASP) are widely used to study the
structural properties, electronic structures, and sensing mechanisms of
PPy with good results [155,156]. There are many examples of studying
sensing mechanisms using QE and VASP for PPy. Ullah et al. have
studied theoretically the PPy as a sensor for ammonia through DFT
methods at the theoretical level of TDB3LYP/6–31 G(d) and
B3LYP/6–31 G(d) techniques [155]. They evaluated and calculated the
geometric and electronic properties of the polymer (PPy) extrapolated
with NH3, also justifying the ammonia sensation by PPy [155]. Moreover,
Coleone, A. P., et al. improved the electronic and optical properties
of PPy by employing the DFT/M06HF/6–31 G(d) approach [156]. The
results also pointed out that PPy-NO2 is a promising component for

exciton dissociation and charge transport. It had been proven that
PPy-OH and PPy-OCH3 can be the most attractive components for optical
applications with redshifts of more than 20 nm compared to unchanged
PPy [156]. In this signification, the design of components with
electronic, reactivity, and optical properties of PPy can be improved by
considering the simple Hammett parameters [156].
Theoretical studies have also been used to investigate the ability of
PPy salt for PPy sensing NH3, CO2, and CO analytes investigated through
DFT calculations at the theoretical level by B3LYP-D3/6–31++G (d, p)
[157,158]. The results showed better selectivity and sensitivity for
ammonia compared to CO2 and CO gas [159]. For example, PPy’s
sensitivity towards NH3 decreases by a certain percentage of (50%, 70%,
or 90%) with an increase in the moisture concentration (4–75%) [157,
158]. Moreover, Ullah, H. et al. reported PPy as a sensing mechanism for
NH3 gas [155]. They have shown that interaction with ammonia would
result in lower resistance for election movements over the oligomer
backbone which is due to the reduction of undoped PPy (Fig. 4). Wasim
et al. employed the theoretical level of B3LYP-CP/6–31 G(d) and evaluated
the sensing power of PPy for the oxygen, nitrogen, and oxynitrogen
analytes PPy-X (X = NO, NO2, and NO2 -
) [159]. The charge
transfer from the analyte to the pyrrole oligomers (excluding nPy-NO2)
was more pronounced in the case of nitrite ions (NO2 -
) compared to NO.
It should be considered that PPy is the best conducting polymer (CP) for
the detection of nitrite anion (NO2􀀀 ) and NH3 at room temperature [154,
159].
5. Theoretical analysis of PPy gas sensors
The PPy has been investigated employing the density functional
theory (DFT), and atoms are also simulated using the super-soft pseudopotential
approach [160]. Mercury (Hg2+) pollution poses significant
risks to the environment and human health, even in low concentrations
[161]. It can lead to severe organ damage such as different motor diseases
and kidney failure cases. Among these, the high-performance
electrochemistry sensor was designed for detecting Hg2+ and the
sensor features were greatly improved, which originally came from the
Schottky barrier of the CuO/Cu/PPy electrode [162]. Benefiting from
the physical barrier, CuO/Cu/PPy electrode was a redistribution of
charge and high Hg2+ adsorption power, which was proved experimentally
and theoretically. Theoretical analysis of the Mulliken charge

indicates that the gaps between the Schottky barrier [163] and the
charge concentration of PPy became larger with the synthesis of Hg2+
[164], which accelerated the reaction velocity and was more favorable
for Hg2+ [162]. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that
introducing a physical barrier to electrochemical metoprolol sensors
was an effective way to develop novel sensors [163]. Nezhadali et al.
have developed electrochemical sensor selective and sensitive detection
by employing DFT computational approach. The sensitivity has been
increased by increasing the conductivity. The sensors are studied by
using the multivariate optimization method to deeply study the parameters
that affect the imprinting effect. This sensor has shown a good
imprinting effect and satisfactory sensing performance through sample
analysis [163].
Zhuang, Y., et al. have confirmed the experimental and DFT results
indicated that introducing a physical barrier to electrochemistry sensors
was an effective means for the development of novel sensors and the
excellent sensing performance was analyzed. Due to the physical barrier
playing a crucial role in electrochemical detection, the sensor can work
in seawater [160]. With the increase in Hg2+ adsorption, the charge
density gap between the Schottky barrier and the concentration of PPy
charge became wider which accelerated the response dynamics and was
more favorable to Hg2+ while the sensitive performance was an
improvement. PPy film and CuO/Cu worked together in the presence of
Hg2+ with low features such as low detection range, good selection, and
strong anti-interference efficiency. Aids to calculation system counting
system for different numbers of Hg2+ adsorbs on CuO/Cu/PPy surface
using DFT method. In this study, they compared adsorption energy (eV)
and reaction coordinate of CuO/Cu/PPy with Hg2+ and the results were
+ 1 Hg2+ (􀀀 1.07 eV), and + 2 Hg2+ (􀀀 1.69 eV) shown in Fig. 5 [160].
In summary, complementary DFT and experimental results can be
used to tailor the electronic structure of PPy gas sensing materials [154,
164]. DFT tools can be used to select a suitable gas sensing material or
even identify the right dopants to enhance selectivity towards target
molecules (both organic and inorganic).

6. Experimental analysis: Insights for improving PPy gas
sensor’s performance
The performance of the PPy mainly depends on the conductivity.
From a practical standpoint, sensitivity, selectivity, and operation at
room temperature are key parameters. PPy is a p-type semiconductor
(resistive gas sensors) and has been evaluated on a lab scale along with
these performance parameters [165]. Lab-scale investigations have also
shown that PPy chains can be formed for enhancing gas sensitivity and
charge exchange [166]. Thus, a combination of strategies including
doping, surface functionalization, and chain formation- is all shown to
have relevance in gas detection. In the formation of PPy chains, of
particular importance is the role of hydrogen bonds, π–π stacking, and
electrostatic interactions. These also improve the mechanical properties
for enhancing material stability [167]. Furthermore, the conjugated
bonds in the PPy can be easily manipulated through doping. Specifically,
the bond can be reduced (i.e., via n-type doped) or oxidized (via p-type
doped). From studies thus far, however, it is clear that doping engineering
is important for improving the gas sensing performance with
PPy (Fig. 6).
In this section, we will be discussing the types of gases that can be
detected by a particular PPy. The PPy polymer usually shows gassensing
properties in an oxidized state. The preparation of PPy can be

done through electrochemical polymerization [168,169]. The easy
oxidation reactions and low-cost processing of PPy make it an
outstanding polymer when compared to other CPs in the gas sensor field.
Moreover, PPy has been applied in different kinds of gas sensors which
include bio-sensors, bio-actuators, neural electrodes, and drug delivery
[170]. For instance, Sajid, H., et al. have reported the sensitivity of PPy
towards CO, NH3, VOCs, and CO2 [171,172]. In general, it is discovered
that PPy has better sensitivity toward ammonia (NH3) and VOCs than
other gases [173], as shown in (Table 6).
Computational studies show that PPy forms both doped (PPy+) and
undoped (PPy) states; both of which are shown to be good candidates for
toxic gas detection (e.g., CO, NH3, CO2, etc.) [173]. Nonetheless, the
doped and undoped states of PPy are more sensitive to NH3 gas when
compared to CO and CO2 gases. Furthermore, the doped form often
shows excellent sensitivity towards NH3 gas when compared to undoped
ones, for example upon ethanol gas.
7. Application of PPy in capturing
Recently, PPy has drawn significant attention to the improvement of
different types of sensors [174-178]. This is due to the transduction
possible using PPy to yield chemical, biochemical, electrical, optical,
thermal, or mechanical signals [179]. Gas sensors are finding applications
in diverse technologies ranging from chemo-resistive sensors,
biosensors, micro-electromechanical systems, coatings, and textiles of
emerging developments. They have also found use in various sectors
such as biomedicine, healthcare, environmental monitoring, etc. There
is already substantial research on deploying PPy for real-world applications
(including in areas associated with flexible electronics) [180].
Nano-sensors have enabled improvements that are otherwise not
achievable via conventional sensors, for instance, sensitivity, accuracy,
and faster response- have all been possible using PPy-based sensors
[181].
In general, PPy is a conductive polymer that has demonstrated
sensitivity to various gases and organic vapors (e.g., acetone, ammonia,
and ethanol) [173]. Methanol and water vapor in the PPy sensors were
identified as multiple gases, and the methanol and water vapor absorption
competed on the surface of the sensor. The sensitivity increases
at low temperatures and low humidity. Fast response and recovery times
are shown at 25 ◦C. The reproducibility of the PPy under different humidity
conditions is good. The optimum operating temperature was
studied at 25 ◦C [182]. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was fast
detected and sensitive when fabricated a flexible pressure sensor using
three-dimensional (3D) PPy foam [183]. PPy was integrated into
chemi-resistive sensors and up-to-date, the use of PPy in SAW sensors
has been found from the literature survey. Examples of these include
Rayleigh wave-based SAW sensors for the detection of acetone,
ammonia, H2S, and NO2, or shear level SAW for hydrogen detection (e.
g., leaky). Based on published research, we have found that the use of
PPy in L-SAW sensors is less common. However, our modern elementary
results suggest the possibility of detecting low concentrations of
ammonia in PPy-based L-SAW sensors [184].
7.1. Chemical and gas sensors
The current research work demonstrates that PPy-based sensors were
fabricated through surfactant-assisted doping. The resulting instrument
was explored and implemented as an effective gas sensor for VOCs and
some toxic gases at low ppm levels. PPy nanostructures were produced
through the polymerization of chemical oxidative employing different
sulfonic acids as surfactants at temperatures of 0–5 ◦C [185]. The doping
of sulfonic acid has a high impact on the morphology of PPy compounds,
which exhibit compact structures such as amorphous, globular, cauliflower,
flakes, and sheets based on surface morphology. The role of the
sulfonyl group in PPy has been confirmed through FT-IR spectroscopic
analysis. The conductivity of doped PPy was sequentially and gradually
increased, and the amount of surfactant added was increased from 0.1 to
2.0 M, depending on the level of doping with concern to the dopant
nature. Real studies and doped PPy gas sensors were investigated at
various ppm levels for different gases. The sensing process following the
reaction system between the gas and the sensor material under study has
been extensively discussed. The early PPy had 70% and 93% responses
to NH3 and Cl2 gases, respectively, while the doped PPy had an increased
response to most of the VOCs and toxic gases under experimental
research and studies. Extensive studies of the different sensing properties
and higher sensitization results of these components demonstrate
that surfactant-doped PPy materials have appeared as effective gas
sensors with excellent response, repeatability, and retrieval at a minimum
of 5 ppm levels [185].
7.2. The fabric-based chemical gas sensors
Textile-integrated gas sensors for health or environmental monitoring
applications need to be combined with gas sensors integrated into
wearable devices. However, the behavior of sensing devices with
electro-conductive textile substrates can be highly environmental and
aging-dependent [186]. Nevertheless, sensors are employed to detect
toxic gases/VOCs. It showed the full functionality of the image after
weaving in different sensing modes and correct sensory responses
(Fig. 7) [187].
7.3. Graphene-based sensors
Graphene-based materials have contributed to the development of
sensitive sensors and biosensors due to their physical and electrochemical
features. The most important features of graphene-based are
flexible and stretchable for multi-functionality sensing devices and the
major advances in sensor technologies (e.g., gas sensors, cancer
biomarker detection, flow sensors, strain sensors, etc.) [188]. Moreover,
the graphene-based sensors also improve the analytical performance for
application in environmental, clinical, and food science, etc., [189]. In
addition, the development of graphene-based flexible gas and chemical
sensors is reviewed in the preparation of materials, the manufacture of
sensors, and their effectiveness. The overview of graphene-based materials
and their potential applications in flexible and stretchable
wearable electronic devices. Herein, mention that Singh, Eric, et al., are
briefly discussed the application of flexible gas sensors for the detection
of various hazardous gases including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ammonia
(NH3), hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2) and humidity [188]. Also, applications of
graphene-based materials are also shortened to detect toxic heavy metal
ions (Cd, Hg, Pb, Cr, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Ag) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) including nitrobenzene, toluene, acetone, formaldehyde,
amines, phenols, bisphenol A (BPA), explosives, chemical warfare
agents and environmental pollutants [188].

applications such as gas sensors, biosensors, temperature sensors pH
sensors, etc. [190,191]. The PPy nanocomposite-based sensors are being
improved that enjoy sensitivity, selectivity, rigidity, and real-time
measurement. These sensor platforms are helped to create new technologies
to ensure environmental and human protection [191].
Recently, researchers have made considerable efforts to use PPy nanocomposites
to create PPy nanocomposite-based sensors in terms of their
promising properties, such as better electrolytic activity, higher electrical
conductivity, and effective surface area in comparison to conventional
polymers [192]. Therefore, relative to their bulk counterparts,
nanocomposite-based sensors exhibit unique features and provide the
basis for the use of various types of sensors (e.g., gas and chemical,
electrochemical and fluorescent, stretchable and bendable strain, as well
as tensile strain, etc.) are used to detect drugs and biomolecules as well
as many new possibilities [193].
7.5. Graphene-based nanocomposites biosensors
PPy nanostructures (e.g., graphene, CNT, metal oxides, metal nanoparticle,
metal sulfides, etc.) are discussed in the PPy matrix for developed
gas sensing performance [194]. The detailed and systematic discussions
on synthesis techniques, gas sensing principles of PPy
nanostructures, and its composites with the development of sensor device
configurations provide the reader with an in-depth understanding
of the above [195]. Moreover, the progress of graphene-based nanocomposite
biosensors with a wide range of advanced sensitivities,
selectivity, and detection for an emerging application. Also, the biological
function of graphene-based materials and the process of nanocomposite
formation and their unique features, surface function,
enzyme destabilization techniques, covalent stabilization, physical absorption,
and bio-interactions processes with biosensors are studies
including good understanding [196].
7.6. Electrochemical sensors
The most widely used PPy is a conducting polymer in the design of a
bioanalytical sensor. Recent advances and issues in the improvement of
molecularly printed PPy are considered [197]. The electrochemical
sensors have appeared as tools for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) detection due to their cost-effectiveness, easy of fabrication and
usage, high sensitivity and selectivity, and better reproducibility [198].
PPy is easily prepared through the polymerization technique and pyrrole
is a chemical species, as well as stable semi-conductive polymer components
solved by electrochemical methods under conditions of mild
synthesis. The PPy is used as a stable molecular structure in which the
imprint of the desired PAHs is localized in situ; can be fabricated on
glassy carbon electrodes [198].
7.7. Optical sensors
Qin et al., and Azzouz et al., have applied PPy to detect volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), and other sensors like optical, capacitive,
and impedance sensors, as shown in Table7, use ppy and other materials
for various gases and VOCs sensors [199–205], through a fiber optic
reflection sensor (FORS) [206,207]. The traditional interfacial polymerization
approach was employed to synthesize sensitive PPy membranes,
with higher reflection and lower roughness. The electrical
properties of conducting polymers like PPy have changed in the exploration
of sensing materials, but their optical properties are rarely
explored. Moreover, the reflected optical signal also changed from PPy
after systematically evaluating the interaction with VOCs. Qin et al., and
ˇSetka et al., have fabricated and exhibited high sensitivity of the PPy in
VOCs under FORS testing with a detection limit of up to 1 ppm [139,
206].
8. Challenges and future prospects
Polymeric materials such as PPy and their derivatives are manufactured
for the following applications: Solving medical diagnostics problems,
pharmaceutical supply, drug delivery, biomedical products,
biotechnology, adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives, coatings,
waterborne coatings, re-dispersible lattices, electronics, magnetics,

optoelectronics, etc., are expected to become the general technologies
investigated in these research fields.
Novel sensors and biosensors will explore a variety of construction
techniques that use PPy as a sensing component, which can be used to
detect small organic, biological, and inorganic, molecular DNA. Moreover,
it can also be used to fabricate heteroatom-doped PPy novel biosensors,
and PPy will be furthermore research carried out. The
biocompatibility of PPy in various sensing applications needs to be
desired furthermore research works in the future. In addition to the
large-scale production of monolayer PPy is a big challenge to overcome
in near future. The current achievement of polymer materials is the use
of polymer nanoparticle drug carriers for combination therapy to treat
cancer. PPy nanomaterials are expected to significantly alter combination
therapy for cancer treatment by regulating the type of deposit and
distribution of multiple drugs at disease sites. Therefore, PPy composite
materials will also become an important player in the fields of electronic
devices and modern medicine.
PPy has several desirable properties that include reasonable chemical
stability, mechanical flexibility, and eco-friendliness. These make
them promising candidates for upcoming technologies wherein gas
sensors are required for a wide range of analytes. Here, we discuss
doping, surface modification, and PPy chain arrangements as important
ways to enhance the gas sensing performance of sensors. Using insights
from both experimental and ab initio studies, we show the current mode
of rationalizing or even designing the sensing substrate for a given analyte.
We also discuss the most common PPy and its current utilities,
from the standpoint of gas sensing. We further identify gaps in the state
of the art- both from fundamental and applied standpoints. Given the
content and scope of this review, we expect this work to spur further
work on the use of PPy for the fabrication of gas sensors and associated
devices.
Over the past few decades, numerous sensitive approaches for the
detection of NH3 gas have been extensively studied to address environmental
and public health concerns. Among the commonly used NH3
gas sensing approaches include solid-state sensing techniques, as well as
metal oxides and PPy-based sensors handling. In particular, metal oxidebased
NH3 gas sensors have been deeply investigated and widely used
due to their high internal sensitivity to NH3 gas. However, much effort is
still needed to further improve the selectivity of NH3 gas.
Furthermore, most of the metal oxide-based NH3 gas sensors demand
relatively high temperatures, which cannot guarantee real-time detection,
portability, and energy-efficient operation [208]. In particular,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or layered graphene are used to lower the
operating temperature due to their higher electrical mobility, which can
greatly improve the general smoothness of metal oxides recovery rate.
But in terms of room temperature activity, the low growth rate of the
analytical gas at room temperature and the high absorption energy between
the analytical gas molecules still need to be developed. And the
rapid recovery of the active part of the sensitive substance quickly
returns to its initial state. Therefore, future research on metal
oxide-based NH3 gas sensors should focus on enhanced selectivity,
sensitivity, and room temperature operations. Like metal oxide-based
NH3 gas sensors, polymer-based NH3 gas sensors are also less selective
when implementing polymer sensing layers due to moisture and
swelling effects. In fact, the humidity and expansion effects in the air are
only a slight defect, for the main defect is caused by long-term instability
and irreversibility. Although the process of immutability is not clearly
explained in the literature, it is mainly attributed to the nucleophilic
invasion of the carbon backbone [209].
In addition, long-term stability is rarely found due to camouflage in
polymer handling. Therefore, in contrast to operating PPy-based NH3
gas sensors and improving long-term stability may be the direction of
future research. Typically, TDLS requires complex sensing system configurations
in order to meet a high degree of sensitivity and finality,
resulting in high system construction costs. Furthermore, complex system
configurations may hinder device miniaturization [210,211].
9. Conclusions
To conclude, although many past studies have focused on developing
a single sensing approach for PPy-based sensors the latest and most
advanced sensing technologies are used for the detection of hybrid
sensing materials or a mix of sensitive materials. In addition, the field of
fancy hybridization is rapidly expanding to sensitive substances or
detection techniques to accurately measure volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) detection. Furthermore, since conclusiveness is a most challenging
goal for almost all kinds of PPy-based sensors, future experimental
research work is also making efforts to improve the selectivity of
hybrid PPy-based sensing methods are also required. With the rapid
development of accumulation devices such as chemical and gas sensors,

fabric-based chemical gas sensors, electrochemical sensors, and optical
sensors have attracted much attention. The sensors device has possessed
various advantages, including reasonable chemical stability, mechanical
flexibility, and eco-friendliness. However, there are still significant
challenges to fabricating sensing devices in large-scale applications. This
review is helpful for all researchers who is doing sensor research on
