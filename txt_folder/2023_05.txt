Multirotor drones can be efficiently used to monitor macro-litter in coastal and riverine environments. Litter on
beaches, dunes and riverbanks, along with floating litter on coastal and river waters, can be spotted and mapped
from aerial drone images. Items detection and classification are prone to image resolution, which is expressed in
terms of Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). The GSD is determined by drone flight altitude and camera properties.
This paper investigates what is a suitable GSD value for litter survey. Drone flight altitude and camera
setup should be chosen to obtain a GSD between 0.5 cm/px and 1.25 cm/px. Within this range, the lowest GSD
allows litter categorization and classification, whereas the highest value should be adopted for a coarser litter
census. In the vision of drawing up a global protocol for drone-based litter surveys, this work sets the ground for
homogenizing data collection and litter assessments.
Marine litter consists of items that have been deliberately discarded,
unintentionally lost, or transported by winds and rivers, into the sea and
on coasts (UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), 2021).
Marine litter abundance in the environment is a global problem, which
can affect beach and dune ecosystems, threaten marine life and harm
humans (Federigi et al., 2022; Fossi et al., 2020; Menicagli et al., 2019;
Panti et al., 2019). A large portion of marine pollution originates from
multiple land-based sources (Andriolo and Gonçalves, 2022; Schwarz
et al., 2019; Veiga et al., 2016), with rivers playing a key role in the
conveyance of plastic towards the ocean (Meijer et al., 2021; Schulz
et al., 2015; van Emmerik et al., 2022). Even though litter consists of
various materials, plastic represents the largest proportion, composing
between 61 % and 87 % of the litter bulk in the environment worldwide
(Galgani et al., 2019; Morales-Caselles et al., 2021; Rangel-Buitrago
et al., 2022; van Emmerik and Schwarz, 2020).
Litter monitoring strategies have been implemented over the last
decades (European Commission, 2013; GESAMP, 2019; OSPAR Commission,
2010), since it is urgent to support managers and stakeholders
in the search for pollution mitigation measures. Different methodologies
and protocols have been specifically designed to survey micro-litter
(items between 1 nm and 5 mm length), meso-litter (between 5 mm
and 2.5 cm) and macro-litter (items longer than 2.5 cm) (GESAMP,

2019), by visual census on beaches and rivers, and with trawls in river
and ocean waters (Galgani et al., 2013; GESAMP, 2019; OSPAR Commission,
2010). In recent years, remote sensing technologies, such as
satellites and drones, have been shown to be effective in providing novel
information on litter abundance and dynamics (Salgado-Hernanz et al.,
2021; Veettil et al., 2022). Satellite images have been exploited to detect
floating litter in ocean and rivers (Martínez-Vicente et al., 2019; Topouzelis
et al., 2021), along with stranded debris on coasts (Acu˜na-Ruz
et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the use of space images is still challenging,
due to i) the low resolution of open-source satellite data, ii) the cost of
commercial satellite imagery, and iii) the absence of ground truth
validation (Biermann et al., 2020; Schreyers et al., 2022; Topouzelis
et al., 2019).
In view of the above challenges, multirotor drones are relatively lowcost
devices that can be exploited for environmental monitoring campaigns
(Manfreda et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2022). Drones require small
effort in the field, and are able to collect and provide high-resolution
imagery. Despite being prone to a limited battery autonomy, drone
flights i) are not invasive, ii) can cover large areas and remote sites, and
iii) can be repeated over the same area with high frequency. Drones have
been shown to be operationally suitable to survey macro-litter presence
in different environments, such as beach-dune systems (Andriolo et al.,
2021b; Andriolo et al., 2020b; Corbau et al., 2023; Gonçalves et al.,
2020b; Taddia et al., 2021), continental shores (Bao et al., 2018; Escobar-
S´anchez et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2018; Merlino
et al., 2020), islands (Deidun et al., 2018; Fallati et al., 2019; Papakonstantinou
et al., 2021; Papakonstantinou et al., 2019; Takaya et al.,
2022), lake beaches (Hengstmann and Fischer, 2020) and riverbanks
(Cortesi et al., 2023; Geraeds et al., 2019). Moreover, drone images have
been exploited to detect floating litter on rivers (Maharjan et al., 2022;
Rahmadya et al., 2022; Rocamora et al., 2021; Schreyers et al., 2021b;
Wolf et al., 2020) and coastal (Almeida et al., 2023; Andriolo et al.,
2022; Escobar-S´anchez et al., 2022; Garcia-Garin et al., 2021; Garcia-
Garin et al., 2020a; Garcia-Garin et al., 2020b) waters.
Regarding drone-based litter surveys, one of the main advantages is
the provision of spatial data, since items can be detected and geolocated
from drone images. Aerial surveys can provide spatial information of
litter abundance and accumulation, which was limited and/or missing in
the reports of traditional techniques assessments, to understand likely
litter pathways and identify new pollution sources (Andriolo and Gonçalves,
2023; Galgani et al., 2013; GESAMP, 2019; OSPAR Commission,
2010). Gonçalves et al. (2022) presented a schematic framework to
outline the different operational steps for a beached litter survey by
multirotor drones. The framework was composed of four stages. The first
stage comprised the planning of the field experience, the second stage
implied the drone flight deployment, the third stage encompassed the
drone image analysis, and the final fourth stage described the litter
survey assessments. Even if the framework was designed for drone-based
litter survey on beaches, most of the stages can be considered for the
application in different environments. In particular, it is of interest to
analyse the second stage regarding the drone flight setup, as this step is
crucial for reliable litter survey assessments.
This baseline describes and discusses the drone flight deployment for
litter surveys in the environment. The paper focuses i) on the choice of
flight altitude, and ii) on the resulting image resolution, commonly
expressed in terms of Ground Sampling Distance (GSD).
During drone-based litter surveys, the camera gimbal is commonly
set to 􀀀 90◦ (nadiral), to capture photos perpendicular to the flight direction
(Andriolo et al., 2020a; Gonçalves et al., 2020b). Drone flight
altitude and camera properties determine the pixel spatial resolution of
drone images (Fig. 1a), which is expressed as Ground Sampling Distance
(Driggers, 2011):
GSD =
H*sw
img*f (1)
where H is the flight altitude (m), sw is the sensor width (mm), img is the
size of image (pixels), and f is the camera focal length (mm).
Gonçalves et al. (2022) showed the different drone flight altitudes
chosen by the 15 studies that adopted the framework for drone-based
litter surveys on beaches and dunes (Fig. 1b). Among works, the variation
of the flight altitude was due to i) the different objectives, ii) the
extent of the monitored area, and iii) the heterogeneity of beach configurations.
A median value of 0.54 cm/px was found among works on
beaches and dunes (Fig. 1b). Extending such analysis to drone-based
litter surveys conducted on riverbanks (Cortesi et al., 2023; Geraeds
et al., 2019), median value was similar (1 cm/px). Finally, considering
floating litter surveys on river (Maharjan et al., 2022; Rahmadya et al.,
2022; Rocamora et al., 2021; Schreyers et al., 2021b; Wolf et al., 2020)
and coastal (Almeida et al., 2023; Andriolo et al., 2022; Garcia-Garin
et al., 2021; Garcia-Garin et al., 2020a; Garcia-Garin et al., 2020b)
waters, the adopted median GSD was of 0.6 cm/px and 0.7 cm/px,

respectively, even though higher flights were tested for covering wider
areas on the sea (Fig. 1b).
The GSD determines the image resolution, thus the detectable size of
litter items. The minimum detectable object size can be expressed as:
Sz = Npx* GSD (2)
where Sz (cm) is the minimum detectable object size, Npx (pixel) is a
constant value indicating the number of pixel units representing an
object, and the GSD (cm/px) is the ground area covered by a single pixel.
Therefore, the suitable GSD for litter monitoring is given by:
GSD = Sz/Npx (3)
The parameter Npx is not defined a priori, and varies in general
between 2 and 5 pixels (Leachtenauer et al., 1997; O’Connor et al.,
2017). This parameter depends on several factors, such as sensor type,
image characteristics, scene complexity, object contrast and image
detection method (Leachtenauer et al., 1997; O’Connor et al., 2017),
among others. Given the experiences in drone-based litter surveys and
image analysis (Gonçalves et al., 2022), it can be assumed that a litter
item is recognizable on drone images when it is represented by at least
four pixels (Npx = 4). However, to be conservative and guarantee a
better resolution of a single item, the value Npx = 5 was also considered
and adopted to solve Eq. (3).
Regarding the litter minimum size Sz, the macro-litter minimum
threshold defined in literature was of 2.5 cm, a value that is referred to
the length of the longest dimension (GESAMP, 2019). However, given i)
the properties of images, ii) the pixel square shape, and iii) the above
observations regarding the Npx parameter, the minimum detectable Sz
on drone images (Eq. (3)) should be considered as 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm
(Fig. 2c). For instance, a cotton bud and/or a straw are macro-litter
items, being their second dimension shorter than 2.5 cm, would not be
spotted on drone images. A minimum litter size of Sz = 5 cm × 5 cm was
also chosen to solve Eq. (3), as the detection and recognition of smaller
items on drone images was quite challenging (Andriolo et al., 2021b;
Andriolo et al., 2020b).
The solution of Eq. (3), adopting Npx = 4, returned a suitable GSD
range of 0.62 cm/px and 1.25 cm/px, whereas for Npx = 5, the range
resulted to be between 0.5 cm/px and 1 cm/px (Fig. 2a-b). Litter items
are well detectable and identifiable on images with GSD = 0.5 cm/px,
even though accumulation and/or beach wrack can make their recognitions
difficult (Fig. 3a,b). Therefore, adopting a GSD lower than 0.5
cm/px would provide images with higher resolution, which perhaps
would be redundant in terms of details (Fig. 2b). On images with GSD
=1.25 cm/px, bigger items are still recognizable, whereas it is not
possible to spot smaller items (Fig. 3b). This GSD value can be suggested
for coarse litter census, and when smaller items will not be characterized
in terms of categories and materials. Finally, on images with GSD higher
than the proposed range, it is not possible to detect most of the litter
identified in previous images, while bigger items are barely recognizable
(Fig. 3b). Besides not allowing the recognition of items smaller than 5
cm × 5 cm (Fig. 2b), adopting a GSD higher than 1.25 cm/px would not
provide enough resolution (Fig. 3a). Therefore, GSD values higher than
1.25 cm/px can merely be suggested for a coarse binary (litter/nonlitter)
detection approach (Pinto et al., 2021), when only big items will
be mapped without any categorization (Fig. 3b).
In the past experiences, when the litter was marked by manual image
screening (Andriolo et al., 2021a), lower GSD (higher resolution)
allowed in general a better recognition of the items (Lo et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, other aspects, such as operator expertise on litter and
experience in image analysis, influenced the accuracy of the final assessments
(Andriolo et al., 2021a; Merlino et al., 2021). When algorithms
for the automated litter detection were developed (e.g., Hidaka
et al., 2022; Kataoka et al., 2018; Pinto et al., 2021; Politikos et al., 2023;
Wolf et al., 2020), the GSD parameter was instead not considered. It is
therefore recommendable that future works devoted to automated
detection techniques would consider the GSD as a crucial aspect. In fact,
the transferability of machine and deep learning algorithms can be
strongly dependent on the image resolution used to train the model,
hence the applications on images with different GSD may be

unsuccessful (Duarte et al., 2020; Gonçalves et al., 2020a, 2020c).
The representation in Fig. 2 should be considered a generalized
approximation, based on a nominal and theoretical GSD. Final assessments
also depend on image quality and/or field conditions, as these can
influence the litter detection. For instance, items that are semi-buried
(Andriolo et al., 2020b; Gonçalves and Andriolo, 2022), trapped
among vegetation (Andriolo et al., 2020a; Corbau et al., 2023), and/or
within beach wrack and natural wood debris (Merlino et al., 2020), can
be difficult to detect and identify on coasts and on riverbanks (Fig. 3b).
On river waters, the presence of natural debris and plants, such as water
hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), can mutually restrain the floating litter
detection (Kataoka and Nihei, 2020; Maharjan et al., 2022), and be
exploited as a proxy for plastic monitoring (Schreyers et al., 2021a). On
coastal waters, shoaling and breaking waves can partially hide and/or
totally submerge floating litter during the image acquisition, whereas
sun glitter can lower image quality and hamper litter detection
(Andriolo et al., 2022; Garcia-Garin et al., 2021; Garcia-Garin et al.,
2020a; Garcia-Garin et al., 2020b). Finally, the different substrates, such
as sand, gravel, rock, vegetation and/or water, can affect the detection
of litter items that have similar colours to image backgrounds (Fig. 3b).
Obtaining a GSD within the proposed range (Fig. 2a) may be not an
easy task, as flight altitude must comply with national and local legislation,
which rule the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles. Yet, the heterogeneity
of coastal and riverine environments can often influence the
choice of drone flight altitude. Logistical constraints, such as dunes,
trees and light posts on coasts and riverbanks, along with bridges and
boats on coastal and river waters, may force the selection of a specific
minimum flight altitude.
To assist future drone deployments in the field, Fig. 4 shows a list of
the most common multirotor drones and/or cameras currently available
on the market. In order to obtain a GSD between 0.5 and 1.25 cm/px, a
potential range of flight altitudes are combined with camera properties.
For instance, the DJI Phantom 4 Pro, which has a built-in camera and
was the most common multirotor drone used for beached litter surveys
(Gonçalves et al., 2022), should fly between 18 m and 46 m above the
ground. Professional drones mounting more powerful cameras have a
longer range of altitudes options, and overall the possibility to fly
higher, given that better visual sensors allow to collect images with
higher resolution (Eq. (1)).
Final considerations regard the likely monitored area extent. It is not
possible to associate here the flight altitude, and thus the GSD, with the
potential coverage area. Such information is given by drone apps during
the flight setup, as flight time and battery autonomy, mutually dependent,
are both influenced by flight speed, image overlap, and environmental
conditions.
In the vision of drawing up a protocol for drone-based litter survey,
this baseline sets the ground for the proposal of a single GSD value, or at
least a short range of GSD, to homogenize data collection among works.
The protocol should promote the use of drones i) to increase the frequency
and locations of litter surveys, ii) to provide spatial information

bags. Different types of plastic bottles are distinguishable on the image with GSD = 0.5 cm/px (left). On the image with GSD = 1.25 cm/px (central), items can still be

images. On the image with GSD = 0.5 cm/px (left), several items were detected, and their material and/or category can be recognized (black boxes). On the image

1.85 cm/px (right). Overall, in b), black boxes bound the detected items, whereas red boxes the missed items. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this

areas, and iii) to advance knowledge on litter dynamics both on coastal
