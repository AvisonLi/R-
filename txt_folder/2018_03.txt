Boron is a key element for some biological processes,but it becomes toxic for humans and plants in concentrations
above a few ppm. We have design a new approach for boron scavenging, based in hybrid membranes
of functional mesoporous silica nanoparticles immobilized in cellulose acetate. The mesoporous
silica nanoparticles, with diameters around 150 nm, were functionalized with vicinal diol groups that complex
boron very efficiently. The functional nanoparticles were covalently immobilized in a cellulose acetate
membrane using a di-terminated alkoxisilane that react with the remaining silanol groups at the nanoparticles
surfaces and with the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose. The functional nanoparticles and the hybrid
membranes show boron removal efficiencies of phenyl boronic acid of up to 93%. The membranes can be
used in multistage filtering systems, with sequential membranes modules in continuous operation, in a
cheap, simple and efficient process for boron scavenging.

1. Introduction
Boron is an oligoelement essential for life, but only in trace amounts.
TheWorld Health Organization recommends that the boron concentration
in water for human consumption is below 2.4 ppm [1,2]. European
Union legislation establishes 1.0 ppm as the maximum permissible
value for boron [3], and in some cases it is desirable that irrigation
water has boron content below 0.5 ppm, namely for the most sensitive
crops, such as lemon [4]. High levels of boron inwater is usually harmful
to living organisms. In humans, it affects the reproductive, cardiovascular
and nervous systems, the kidneys, liver and gastrointestinal tract. In
plants, it may retard the photosynthesis and therefore affect the plant's
growth and productivity [5,6].
High boron contents inwater occur naturally, fromleaching of rocks
and soils containing borates and borosilicates. However, the most common
sources are from anthropogenic origin, mainly wastewaters from
industries such as glass and ceramics, fertilizers, pesticides, soaps and
detergents, semiconductors, military armors, flame retardants, pharmaceutical
drugsmanufacturing, aswell as agricultural and urban activities
[1,2,7].
Themain formof boron inwater is boric acid, B(OH)3, and its conjugated
base, tetrahydroxyborate ion, [B(OH)4]−, depending on the pH
[8]. However, in industrial effluents other forms of boron may also appear,
like boronic acids, e.g. phenylboronic acid, PhB(OH)2. Boronic
acids are the preferred form of boron in Suzuki-Miyaura reactions for
the formation of C\\C bonds. These reactions are often used in the pharmaceutical
industry [9,10].
In aqueous media, boric acid, boronic acids and their conjugated
bases form anionic complexes with vicinal diols, –CH(OH)–CH(OH)–
[9,11,12], more efficiently at moderately alkaline pH (pH ≈ 9). These
complexes are the basis of most techniques used to remove boron
from wastewater, like electrodialysis, membrane filtration, precipitation-
coagulation, evaporation-crystallization processes, reverse osmosis
and adsorption [13].
Of these methods, electrodialysis and other electrochemical techniques
are effective but energy demanding [14,15].Membrane filtration
methods are efficient and selective but require complex and expensive
equipment [14,16]. Precipitation-coagulation methods have low efficiencies
and lack specificity for boron removal [17,18]. Reverse osmosis
(RO) is very efficient to remove ions in wastewater, but for boric or boronic
acids removal shows lower yields due to the reduced ionization of
boronic species at neutral pH [14,16,19]. Some strategies can be used to
circumvent this problem, such as changing thewater pH to 9, using seawater
RO membranes or denser membranes, combining ROmembranes
with nanofiltration [20], using thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes
[21], and combining RO membranes and boron adsorption compounds,
like GAC (granular activated carbon), iron (III) hydroxides [13]
or polyols [22]. However, these strategies still have problems, such as
membrane corrosion at theworking pH necessary for boron scavenging
or high energy consumption [23,24,25].
Adsorption techniques are an alternative to the previous methods.
These techniques present important design advantages over
other methods, such as high versatility due to the variety of sorbents
that can be used, allowing the separation of different pollutants.
Additionally, they are also conceptually easier to scale up for larger
scale operation.
Most published adsorption-based boron removing systems are
based on resins [26–27,28,29,30,31,32,33], including polymer matrices
[26,27] and ion-exchange resins [33] or mesoporous silica [18,34–35,
36,37,38]. Other adsorbents include ashes [39], activated carbon [40],
clay minerals [41], metal oxides [42], and sugar derivatives such as sorbitol
[43], mannitol [20], D-methyl glucamine [44], or Dgluconoamidoethyl
immobilized in polymer nanoparticles [45]. The
main drawbacks of these adsorbents are the high cost associated with
the boron removal process or the material itself [13,20]. In the case of
columns (static method) the process requires heavy equipment and
the regeneration can be hard. On the other hand, if the materials are
used in dispersion (dynamic method), the removal is an additional operation
step. Moreover, if the active removal moiety is a sugar derivative,
the synthesis can be very challenging.
Herein, we present a new and simple system for water boron scavenging
based on membrane filtration with immobilized mesoporous
material functionalized with boron chelating groups.
Mesoporous materials based on MCM-41 are composed by amorphous
mesoporous silica, with high surface area (N700 m2/g) and
pore volume (N1 cm3/g), and tunable porewidth. They can be prepared
froma sol-gel procedure using a surfactant as template (typically a quaternary
ammonium base) [46,47]. The typical applications of these materials
are in catalysis and adsorption, however, the particle size of
MCM-41 materials is very large (in the μm range) which hinders their
use in applications that require fast mass transfer and good size homogeneity
in the finalmaterials. The synthesis process can be changed (different
temperatures, reactants concentrations, pH) to reduce the
particle size to values below 200 nm. Thesemesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSNs) are very versatilematerials,which can be selectively functionalized
at the internal and external surfaces, and are able to
incorporate different atoms and molecules in the silica network, and
also accommodatemolecules or even polymers in the pore volume [48].
Here,we functionalize the MSNs surfacewith vicinal diols groups for
boron removal. The MSNs were covalently immobilized in a cellulose
acetate membrane using a crosslinking agent. The performance of the
final hybrid membrane in the water boron scavenging process was optimized
for the diol content and the crosslinking density. These hybrid
active membranes open the opportunity to design versatile and low
cost continuous removal systems of simple preparation, implementation
an operation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, Sigma, 99%), hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB, Sigma, 99 + %), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH, Eka, p.a. pellets), absolute ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), 3-
glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GOPTS, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%),
poly(dimethylsiloxane), bis(triethoxysilyl) terminated (ABCR
GmbH&Co), 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene hydrate (TCI,
N95%), phenylboronic acid (PBA, Fluka, 97%), ammonium hydroxide
(NH4OH 25%, Fluka), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt
dihydrate (EDTA, Riedel-de Haën, 99%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl
37%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. Deionized water from a
Millipore system (Milli-Q ≥ 18 MΩ cm) was used in all synthesis and
characterization steps. WHATMAN® Cellulose Acetate Circle Membranes
(CA1, 0.2 μmpore size, 47mm) and Sartorius® Cellulose Acetate
Membrane Filters (CA2, 0.2 μm pore size, 13 mm diameter) were used
as received. A Plastic syringe holder for 13 mm membranes was used
in the filtration tests.
2.2. Synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs)
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized under
basic conditions using TEOS as silica precursor, CTAB as surfactant template,
NaOH as catalyst and water as solvent [49]. First, 0.5 g of CTAB
were dissolved in 240 mL of water with vigorous stirring, in a polypropylene
flask. The mixturewas in an oil bath at 80 °Cwith vigorous magnetic
stirring. After CTAB was completely dissolved, 1.75 mL of an
aqueous solution of NaOH (1.7 M) were added, followed by a dropwise
addition of 2.5 mL of TEOS. After 2 h the nanoparticles were recovered
by centrifugation and washed three times with a 8:2 water:ethanol solution
(60,000 g, at 20 °C for 20 min each cycle), and dried in a ventilated
oven at 50 °C overnight.
408 F. Albertini et al. / Materials and Design 141 (2018) 407–413
Surfactant extraction was performed by dispersing 0.5 g of dried
nanoparticles in 20 mL of an ethanolic solution of HCl (0.5 M). The dispersion
was kept at 40 °C with magnetic stirring for 2 h. The nanoparticles
were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with
absolute ethanol (60,000 g, at 20 °C for 20 min each cycle), and dried
in a ventilated oven at 50 °C overnight.
2.3. Functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles
The functionalization ofMSNswith GOPTSwas performed following
the post-synthesis graftingmethod using dry toluene at reflux in argon
atmosphere or using ethanol at 40 °C. The ratio of graftingmolecules per
unit area was 40 μmol/m2, an excess to obtain a good surface coverage.
The specific areaused for theMSNswas 950m2/g (obtained by nitrogen
sorption measurements).
Functionalization of MSN1: 0.1 g of MSNs and 5 mL of dry toluene
were added into a round-bottom flask and placed in an ultrasounds
bath for 10 min. Then, 0.839 mL of GOPTS were added to the mixture
and the mixture was brought to reflux for 24 h, with magnetic stirring.
All these steps were carried out in an argon atmosphere.
Functionalization of MSN2: 0.35 g of MSNs and 17.6 mL of ethanol
were added into a polypropylene flask and placed in an ultrasounds
bath for 10 min. Then, 2.95 mL of GOPTS were added to the mixture
and the mixture was heated to 40 °C for 48 h, with magnetic stirring.
In both cases, the nanoparticles were recovered by centrifugation
and washed with absolute ethanol (3 × 50 mL, 41,200 g, at 20 °C for
15 min, each cycle), and dried in a ventilated oven at 50 °C overnight.
To open the epoxy ring of GOPTS, water was added to the functionalizedMSNs
(10 mLofwater to 0.1 g ofMSN) and the mixturewas heated
to 70 °C during 48 h, with magnetic stirring. The nanoparticles were
recovered by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol
(3 × 50 mL, 60,000 g, at 20 °C for 20 min each cycle), and dried in a ventilated
oven at 50 °C overnight.
The amount of GOPTSmolecules grafted on the surface ofMSNswas
determined by 1H NMR (Supporting information, Figs. SI 1–3) [50].
Samples were prepared with 5 mg of functionalized nanoparticles, a
known amount of 1,3,5-trioxane (ca. 0.5 mg) as internal standard and
0.5 mL of D2O/NaOH (pH 13). The samples were placed in an ultrasounds
bath for 30 min to destroy the nanoparticles, before performing
the analysis.
2.4. Films preparation
Films of MSNs were prepared over cellulose acetate membranes.
Membranes (CA1 and CA2) have 0.20 μm pores, with pore volumes estimated
as 74% of the volume of the membrane for CA1 (Supporting Information,
Section SI 2).
A Teflon mold was used for the film preparation. In a first batch of
films for preparation conditions optimization, a mold with squared
16×16mmholeswas used (Supporting information, Fig. SI 4). A second
batch of films, to evaluate the boron removal performance, was prepared
in a mold with circular orifices 13 mm in diameter (Supporting
information, Fig. SI 5). A solution of 10 wt% MSNs in ethanol was kept
in a ultrasound bath for 1 min., and transferred to the mold dropwise
using a micropipette. The film dried overnight at room temperature.
Poly(dimethylsiloxane), bis(triethoxysilyl) terminated dispersed in
ethanol was then added for crosslinking the nanoparticles and the
membranes and left drying overnight at room temperature. The films
preparation data are collected in the Supporting Information for the
preparation conditions optimization (S1, Table SI1) and boron removal
performance (S2, Table SI2).
2.5. Membrane performance tests to assess the residual boron in water
All filtrations were performed with the membrane film in a plastic
syringe holder with a diameter of 13 mm. In all cases, the pH of the
initial solution was set at around 9 before the filtration, in order to promote
boron complexation [51]. The fluorescence emission spectra were
corrected with the value corresponding at 330 nm. For quantification,
the integrals of the emission spectra were calculated and normalized
to the initial solution. After each measurement, the pH of the samples
was measured and in all cases it was between 8.9 and 9.1.
2.6. Boron detection method
In order to assess the residual boron in water, we used a previously
proposed fluorimetric method based on the use of the molecule
2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (L) as boron sensor [51,52]. In
this method, pH was set to 9 in the presence of NH3 buffer and EDTA.
For each sample, 0.4 mL of the solution to be analyzed were mixed together
with 0.3 mL of a mixture of 0.133 M NH3 and 0.333 M EDTA
with pH previously set at 9, and 1.5 mL of a 1.25 μM solution of the
boron sensor 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene in water. The
samples were then left in the dark for 4 h before performing the analysis.
Care was taken in order to avoid contact between the samples containing
the sensor and borosilicate glass. At the end, the pH of the
samples was checked, to be between 8.9 and 9.1.
2.7. Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imageswere obtained on a
Hitachi transmission electron microscope (Model H-8100 with a LaB6
filament)with an accelerator voltage of 200 kV. The dried nanoparticles
were dispersed in ethanol. One drop of dispersion was placed on a carbon
grid and dried in air before observation. The nanoparticle dimensions
were determined using “Image J” software. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JEOL SEM model
JSM7001F, with an accelerated voltage of 15 kV. The samples were previously
covered with a chromium layer. Nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA) was performed with a Nanosight instrument, model LM14C. Solution
proton NMR were performed on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer
(Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at
400 MHz. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on
a Bruker Alpha instrument in the region of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution
of 4 cm−1 using KBr pellets. Nitrogen adsorption studies were
performed in a gas porosimeter (Micromeritics) with accelerated surface
area and porosimetry system. The specific surface area and the
total pore volume were determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
(BET) isotherm, and the average mesopore diameters assessed by the
BJH algorithm. X Rays diffraction spectra were obtained on RIGAKU
MiniFlex II with a X rays tube of CuKa (30 kV/15 mA). The pH of the solutions
was measured with a bench pH/mV/°C meter pH 1000 L, phenomenal
®. The fluorescence measurements were obtained on a
Horiba-JobinYvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter.
3. Results and discussion
Our novel strategy to harvest boron from residual water relies on
cellulose acetate membrane incorporating silica mesoporous materials
functionalized with boron chelating groups (Fig. 1).
The hybridMSNswere prepared using a modified sol-gel procedure,
catalyzed by hydroxide as base, and using CTAB as template [49]. The
synthesis was performed at 80 °C for 2 h, and after cleaning the nanoparticles,
the surfactant was removed using an acidified ethanolic solution,
that disrupt the micelles structures and the CTAB is removed from
the pores. Surfactants (and especially ionic surfactants) tend to adsorb
on the silica nanoparticles surfaces, and to ensure the complete removal
of the CTAB, we wash the MSNs exhaustively with ethanol. We have
prepared two batches of nanoparticles with mean diameters of
(139 ± 45) nm for MSN1 and (166 ± 68) nm for MSN2. The TEM images
in Fig. 2 show that, although the shape is not perfectly homogeneous,
the nanoparticles present a clear mesoporous internal structure.
F. Albertini et al. / Materials and Design 141 (2018) 407–413 409
The MSNs were surface-functionalized with an epoxide using 3-
glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GOPTS). The GOPTS was
immobilized in MSN1 under toluene reflux at 125 °C, and in MSN2
under ethanol reflux at 40 °C (MSN-epoxide in Fig. 1). After washing
the nanoparticles at the end of the reaction, the epoxide ring was
opened, treating the nanoparticles with water at 70 °C (MSN-diols in
Fig. 1) [53]. The number of vicinal diols immobilized on the MSNs surface
was obtained from 1H NMR after destroying the MSNs with
NaOH, using trioxane as internal standard and deuterated water as solvent
[50]. The obtained diol modification was 1.7 diols/nm2 for MSN1-
diols and 0.7 diols/nm2 forMSN2-diols (Fig. SI 1-3, Supporting information).
These values correspond to the functionalization of the internal
and external surface area of the nanoparticles. A good coverage was obtained
using either toluene (MSN1-diols) or ethanol (MSN2-diols),
however the functionalization in ethanol has the advantage to be less
expensive and a simpler alternative to the functionalization in dry toluene.
The functionalized nanoparticles (MSN1-diols and MSN2-diols)
were used as active material in the boron removal cellulose acetate
(CA) membranes. The functionalization was also confirmed by Fourier
Transform infrared spectroscopy, with the typical stretching vibration
bands of CH2 groups at 2890 and 2940 cm−1 present in MSN-diols
nanoparticles (Fig. SI 4, Supporting information).
Two different CA membranes were used (pore size of 0.20 μm in
both cases, SEM images in Fig. SI 6), presenting different structures,
with CA1 showing larger pores when compared to CA2.
The nanoparticles were dispersed in the CA membranes, and
immobilized to the cellulose through a dialkoxysilane crosslinker. The
films were prepared in two steps: first, a dispersion of the hybrid
MSNs in ethanol was spread over the CA membrane, and after drying,
the crosslinker was added to the membrane, reacting with the free
silanols at the silica nanoparticles surface andwith the hydroxyl groups
of the cellulose. A first batch of membraneswas preparewith non-functionalized
nanoparticles, to optimize the membrane preparation conditions
(Table SI1, Supporting Information). The visual aspect of the films
is homogeneous without any apparent excess of nanoparticles (Fig. SI7,
Supporting information). The films were characterized by SEM from the
central part of the samples (Fig. 3 and Figs. SI 8–16, Supporting
information).

The first samples (S1-1 to S1-4) use 5.3×10−5 g of MSN1 nanoparticles
per mm2 of membrane (the amount estimated to fill the pores
of the membrane – Supporting information), and 50 wt%, 10 wt%,
5 wt% or 1 wt%, respectively, of crosslinker (with respect to the nanoparticles
weight – Table SI1, Supporting information). The SEM images
of these samples show low homogeneity, cracks and an excess of nanoparticles
visible in the aggregates formed (Fig. 3,AtoD).This is especially
clear from the lateral view of sample S1–4 (Fig. 3E), showing the
support (1), the tape (2), the CA membrane (3) and the nanoparticle
film (4), where most of the nanoparticles remain on the surface of the
CA membrane.
To overcomethe excess of nanoparticles in the films, we reduced the
MSN1-diols concentration to half (S1-5 to S1-7, Table SI 1), but the
problem persisted (Fig. 3 F and G). Only after a 10 times reduction in
MSN1 nanoparticle concentration (S1-8, S1-9 and S1-10, with 10 wt%,
5 wt% and 1 wt% of crosslinker, respectively – Table SI1) it was possible
to obtain films with good quality and no excess of nanoparticles (S1-9
and S1-10), as shown in the SEM images of Fig. 3H–J.
The last conditions were used to prepare films with the functionalized
nanoparticles MSN1-diols (S1-11 and S1-12, Table SI1). The SEM
images (Fig. 4) show some aggregates on the film surface when compared
with bare nanoparticles (MSN1) films. Although surface
functionalization of the nanoparticles increases their aggregation, probably
by reducing the nanoparticle colloidal stability, the quality of the
membranes obtained from these particles is still acceptable for their
use in boron scavenging.
We also prepared films over CA2 membranes,with the sameMSN1-
diols concentration and crosslinker (S1-13, S1-14 and S1-15, with
5 wt%, 2 wt% and 1 wt% crosslinker respectively – Table SI 1). The SEM
images (Fig. 5) show that the films have lower surface homogeneity
than the films prepared on CA1 membranes. This probably reflects the
different morphology of both membranes (Fig. SI 6, Supporting
information).
The strategy of our approach is to use the hybrid membranes in a filter
module to develop a continuous process for boron scavenging from
water. Although the functionalized nanoparticles are covalently
immobilized to the cellulose acetate membrane, we evaluated if the
water flow across the membrane could affect its integrity by filtering
pure water through the hybrid membrane and analyzing the filtrate
for the presence of nanoparticles. Using hybrid membranes produced
from different cellulose acetate membranes (CA1 and CA2) and with
crosslinker contents of 1, 2 and 5 wt%, we measured the nanoparticle
concentration in the filtrate by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA),
concluding that the membrane integrity depends essentially on the
type of cellulose acetate support used (Table 1 and Fig. SI 17, Supporting
information). Themembrane with CA1 as support and 5% of crosslinker
does not have any losses, andwith 1% crosslinker the value is negligible.
However, with CA2 we observed losses of 1.1–2.8 wt% of nanoparticles
(Fig. SI 17, Supporting information). These values indicate that the immobilization
of the nanoparticles to the cellulose acetate membrane is
more efficient in the case of CA1. This confirms the lower quality of
membranes with CA2 as support (Fig. 5) when compared with CA1
(Figs. 3 and 4).
The MSNs nanoparticles have typically high pore volumes (0.7–
1 cm3/g), an important parameter to applications where fast mass
transfer is a requisite, as in the case of the present application. In our
case, since the MSNs are covalently anchored to the CA membranes,
the diffusion through the MSNs after immobilization could be affected.
This effect was evaluated by measuring the pore volume using nitrogen
sorption experiments (Table 2 and Fig. SI 18, Supporting information).
The surface area obtained from the BET isotherms of the membranes
is not comparable to the data of the bare MSNs (surface area 950 m2/g
and pore volume 0.77 cm3/g), because in the hybrid membranes, the
surface area of the CA membrane is also taken into account. However,
from Table 2 it is possible to observe a decrease in the surface area
with the increase in crosslinker content, indicating that the mesopores
of the MSNs become less accessible when more crosslinker is used.

The mesopore volume follows the same trend, with no mesopore volume
measured for the membrane with higher amount of crosslinker,
probably because when high contents of crosslinker are used, the
mesopore entrance are occluded.
Preliminary boron scavenging tests were performed by filtering an
aqueous solution of phenylboronic acid (PBA) through the hybrid membranes.
The boron remaining in the filtrate was determined by a fluorimetric
method [51,52] as described in Section 2.6. The boron removal
efficiency indicates the quantity of boron removed by the membranes.
The first test was performed with the hybrid nanoparticles MSN2-
diols in dispersion, to assess the performance of the nanoparticles before
immobilization (Fig. 6). The pH of the initial solution was set at a
value around 9 before the filtration [51]. The fluorescence emission
spectra were corrected with the emission at 330 nm. After each measurement,
the pH of the samples was re-checked, and it was always in
the range of 8.9 to 9.1.
With theMSN2-diols nanoparticles we obtained an 89% removal efficiency
from a solution of 10 ppm of boron, using the same amount of
nanoparticles present in the hybrid membranes. If we increase the
amount of nanoparticles ten times, the boron removal efficiency increases
to 93%, with the final boron concentration below 1 ppm
(starting from 10 ppm), which is within the EU maximum permissible
limit [3]. After storing the nanoparticles for two months, they present
the same boron removal performance as fresh nanoparticles.
The boron removal mechanism, in our case for phenylboronic acid,
relies in the formation of PhB(OH)3
− in alkalinemedia, followed by complexation
of a diol groupwith displacement of two hydroxyl groups (SI5
in the Supporting information) [32,45].
The membranes used for the boron scavenging tests comprise different
hybrid nanoparticles (MSN1-diols and MSN2-diols), crosslinker
content and cellulose acetate membrane (Table SI 2). Before testing
the hybrid membranes (MSN-diols + cellulose acetate membrane),
we performed a test with the bare cellulose acetate membrane to evaluate
if the membrane without active nanoparticles present some interaction
with boron. The results show no boron interaction with the nonmodified
membrane (the boron content was exactly the same before
and after passing the boron solution by the membrane).
The first membranes tested have 5 wt% (S2-1 and S2-4) and 1 wt%
(S2-3 and S2-6) crosslinker content. In the case of the higher crosslinker
content, we don't observe a reduction in the boron concentration (even
after 10 filtration cycles). These membranes have a reduced mesopore
volume available due to the dense crosslinking, and the pores are
obstructed. The membranes with 1% crosslinker content show a high
level of nanoparticles leaching (Table 1), due to the higher pH of the solution
(around 9), when compared with the leaching tests with pure
water (Table 1, pH around 6). These results motivated us to prepare
membranes with 2% crosslinker content to increase the robustness of
the hybridmembrane,without compromising theMSN-diolsmesopore
volume. We prepare membranes with both CA membrane support (S2-
2 and S2-5, Table SI 2). These newmembranes don't showany nanoparticles
losses after 10 filtration cycles. In both cases, after one filtration
cycle, we observe a decrease of up to 70% relative to the initial boron
concentration. An increase in the number of cycles doesn't decrease
the boron removal efficiency. The membranes present a good stability
over time,with similar boron removal efficiency after twomonths storage,
when compared with fresh membranes.
Our preliminary results show good prospects for the use of the hybrid
membranes in boron scavageng from water. The membranes
showgood robustness and can be used in modules composed of several
membranes to achieve higher boron removal efficiencies.
4. Conclusions
We prepared novel hybrid membranes for boron removal from
water, based on functional mesoporous silica nanoparticles
immobilized in cellulose acetate supports. Themesoporous silica nanoparticles,
with diameter around 150 nm, were functionalized with vicinal
diols that interact efficiently with boron. These functional
mesoporous silica nanoparticles were covalently immobilized into cellulose
acetatemembranes, using a terminal di-alkoxysilane crosslinker.
The crosslinker reacts with the silanol groups remaining at the surface
of the silica nanoparticles and with the free hydroxyl groups of the cellulose.
The hybrid membranes present a homogeneous distribution of
the nanoparticles, after optimization of the nanoparticles concentration
and crosslinker content.
The boron scavenging capability of the newmaterials was evaluated
with a solution of phenylboronic acid. The hybrid nanoparticles in dispersion
were able to remove up to 93% of the initial boron content,
and the hybrid membranes reduce the boron concentration to 70% of
its initial value in a single filtration step.
The novel boron-chelating membranes offer good prospects for the
development of easy and inexpensive boron scavenging technology,
using multistage membranes modules in continuous operation. This
boron removal process present important design advantages, in particular,
the conceptually easy scale up, with simple preparation, implementation
an operation.

Fig. 6. Fluorescence emission spectra of the sensor L (0.9 μM) in the presence of the PBA
remaining in water after scavenging experiments with MSN2-diols. The solid curve
corresponds to fluorescence emission spectrum of the sensor in the presence of the
initial PBA concentration in water (10 ppm of boron). The dotted (the same amount of
nanoparticles that is present in the hybrid membrane) and dashed (10 times the
concentration of nanoparticles than is present in the membrane) curves correspond to
the fluorescence emission spectrum of the sensor in the filtrate after being in contact
with the nanoparticles. The spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength λexc =
310 nm in ammonia buffer (18 mM) at pH = 9, in the presence of EDTA (45 mM) at
20 °C. Insets: efficiency of boron removal.
