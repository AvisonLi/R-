A system of modular sealed gas target cells has been developed for use in electron scattering experiments
at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). This system was initially developed to
complete the MARATHON experiment which required, among other species, tritium as a target material. Thus
far, the cells have been loaded with the gas species 3H, 3He, 2H, 1H and 40Ar and operated in nominal beam
currents of up to 22.5 ŒºA in Jefferson Lab‚Äôs Hall A. While the gas density of the cells at the time of loading
is known, the density of each gas varies uniquely when heated by the electron beam. To extract experimental
cross sections using these cells, density dependence on beam current of each target fluid must be determined.
In this study, data from measurements with several beam currents within the range of 2.5 to 22.5 ŒºA on each
target fluid are presented. Additionally, expressions for the beam current dependent fluid density of each target
are developed.
1. Introduction
A modular gas cell target system was developed for use in Jefferson
Lab‚Äôs Hall A for the MARATHON experiment E12-10-103 [1]. The
design was specifically developed to safely contain and operate with
gaseous tritium. The modular design allows gas cells filled with other
species of gas to be installed in the system concurrently. The target
was also adapted for experiments E12-11-112 (ùë•ùëè > 1) [2], E12-14-011
(ùëí, ùëí‚Ä≤ùëù) [3,4], E12-17-003 (Hypernuclear) [5] and E12-14-009 (elastic)
[6]. MARATHON, together with these experiments, became known

as the tritium group of experiments and were performed from December
2017 through November 2018. Prior to the tritium group of
experiments operations, a target cell of this same design was filled with
argon gas and used by experiment E12-14-012 (Argon) [7,8] during
Spring of 2017.
While the performance of the target was an important consideration,
the primary objective of the target system design and construction
was to ensure safe operations with tritium gas under all conditions.
These conditions included target cell preparations, loading, storage,
transportation, installation, removal, and beam operations. This was

accomplished with a modular design, rigorous fabrication and testing,
proper quality assurance and quality control, and multiple layers of
containment/confinement.
In addition to describing of the target, we present the beam current
dependent density of the five gases used with the target system, 3H,
3He, 2H, 1H and 40Ar. The electron beam deposits energy in the cell
end caps as well as in the target fluid. This ionization energy, which is
proportional to the beam current, heats the target fluid causing local
changes in the density. To determine the magnitude of this effect, data
were collected with the left high resolution spectrometer (LHRS) in
Jefferson Lab Experimental Hall A during February 2017 for the 40Ar
target and December 2017 for the other targets. The beam energy for
the study was 2.2 GeV in all cases, The angle and momentum settings
were 17.5‚ó¶ and 1.79 GeV for 40Ar, and 17.0‚ó¶ and 1.99 GeV for the other
fluids. Analysis shows that a simple quadratic polynomial function
normalized to zero current provides an excellent descriptive fit function
for all target fluids.
2. Target system
The modular design allows for multiple cell configurations. It also
enables individual cells to be installed in special configurations of the
standard Hall A cryogenic target such as the 40Ar target (see Fig. 1).
Another feature is that it allows cells to be filled at off-site locations.
The tritium cell was filled at Savannah River Site (SRS) by Savannah
River Tritium Enterprises (SRTE), with 0.1 grams of tritium gas to a
room temperature absolute pressure of 1.38 MPa. It was shipped in
a special purpose transport container called the bulk tritium shipping
package (BTSP). Including the cell this system provided continuous
triple layer confinement throughout the shipping and handling process.
This design also allowed the tritium cell to be placed in a storage
container in Hall A while normal Hall installation activities were completed.
The tritium cell was installed after all other preparatory tasks
were completed. The modular sealed gas cell represents a departure
from previous designs [9]. Fig. 2 shows the design of the gas cell
design. This design is similar to the design proposed in Ref. [10] with
engineering details for the construction and loading of these cell in
Ref. [11].
The configuration of the target system for the tritium experiments
is shown in Fig. 3. In this configuration, there are (from top to bottom)
four cells loaded with 3H, 2H, 1H, and 3He as well as a fifth empty cell
which was used for background measurements. The cells are contained
in a scattering chamber which is under vacuum. The scattering chamber
vacuum is isolated from the upstream beam line vacuum by a 0.2 mm
thick beryllium window. This window is roughly 30 cm upstream of
the target center and is mounted on a reentrant tube that also contains

a 15 cm long tungsten collimator with an inner diameter of 12.7 mm.
The scattering chamber vacuum, with a pumping system directed to
an exhaust stack, provided a second layer of tritium confinement.
An exhaust system, (together with strict access controls) capable of
maintaining a slight negative pressure in the experimental Hall ensured
that the Hall boundary was a third layer of confinement.
Each cell is machined from ASTM B209 aluminum 7075-T651 plate.

a diameter of 12.7 mm. The total volume of the cell (including the nonactive
region) is 33.4¬±0.2 cm3. The thickness of the nearly flat entrance
window and hemispherical exit window is nominally 0.25 mm. The
parameters at the time of loading for each cell are summarized in
Table 1.
Due to machining tolerances, the wall thickness of each cell varies
slightly over its length. Thickness measurements were performed for
each cell at several locations as schematically represented in Fig. 4 and
summarized in Table 2. These measurements were performed with a
Magna Mike 8600 Hall effect thickness gauge which provides a relative
uncertainty of 0.001 mm and an absolute uncertainty of 0.007 mm. The
error shown in Table 2 indicates the standard deviation of multiple
measurements in a 2 mm radius for a given location. The 40Ar cell,
installed in February 2017, was later evacuated and installed as the
empty cell for the tritium group of experiments, so Table 2 shows the
40Ar and the empty cell in a single column.
Once installed in the Hall A scattering chamber, the target cells were
cooled to 40 K with the temperature maintained using a 15 K helium
supply and a controlled heater. This cooling was required to removed
the modest amount of heat generated by the electron beam passing
through the target fluid, cell entrance and cell exit, which, in total,
was about 15 W. To ensure cell integrity, the maximum beam current
permitted on any of the cells was 22.5 ŒºA [11]. The heat generated by
the tritium decay is very small, about 50 mW.
3. Hall A spectrometers
The data were acquired with the left high resolution spectrometer
(LHRS). For a detailed description of the LHRS see Ref. [12]. The basic
components of the LHRS are a normal conducting quadrupole (Q1), a
superconducting quadrupole (Q2), a superconducting dipole (D), and
a superconducting quadrupole (Q3) in a Q‚ÄìQ‚ÄìD‚ÄìQ configuration. The
quadrupoles focus scattered charged particles while the dipole bends
these particles, within a given momentum range, to the detectors.
After passing through the spectrometer magnets, the scattered particles
pass through two vertical drift chambers (VDCs) that provide tracking
information [13]. Two layers of scintillator hodoscopes, s0 and s2, are
on either side of a gas Cherenkov detector filled with CO2 [14]. The
hodoscopes provide trigger and time of flight for the detected particles.
The Cherenkov provides identification of electrons with approximately
99% efficiency and reject ùúã‚àí below a momentum of 4.8 GeV/c. The
last element in the detector stack is the shower calorimeter. Electrons
passing through the calorimeter lead glass blocks induce a cascade of
pair production and bremsstrahlung radiation from which their energy
can be determined [12].
4. Beam current monitor
The beam current monitor system is comprised of three independent
devices and a current source [15]. This is a dedicated system in Hall A
and while independent of the target effects, this system is the dominant
source of systematic uncertainty in the current dependent density
studies presented herein. The system‚Äôs devices consist of a toroidal
sensor (Unser) [16], located between upstream and downstream RF
cavities (BCMs), and a data-acquisition system. A current source, which
is connected to a wire which passes through the Unser, is used to
calibrate the Unser immediately prior to each use of the device and
the Unser is then used to calibrate the BCMs with the electron beam.
The Unser monitor is composed of two identical toroidal coils driven
in opposite directions by an external source. The DC component of the
current flowing through the toroid sensor is detected by a magnetic
modulator. The beam current passing through the cores produces a
flux imbalance, which generates an output signal proportional to the
even harmonics of the frequency of excitation. In the absence of a DC
current, the sum of the signals is zero [15].
The temperature controlled Unser has a sensitivity to beam current
of about 4 mV‚àïŒºA and has a DC offset subtracted stability within
0.1% [15]. The system‚Äôs DC offset does slowly drift, necessitating the
current calibration to be done immediately prior to using it for an
absolute current calibration of the RF cavities. Once calibrated, the
RF cavities are used to continuously monitor the beam current. The
calibrations are checked periodically throughout the course of an experiment.
To put the signals from the Unser and RF cavities into the
scalers of Hall‚Äôs fast data acquisition system, a voltage to frequency
(V/F) converter is used along with a discriminator. Fig. 5 shows the
Unser calibration with a known DC current source, the response of the
system is found to be (249.7 ¬± 9.6) √ó 10‚àí6 ŒºA/Hz.
The beam current monitors (BCM) are 1497 MHz resonant cavities
located immediately before and after the Unser and are used to
continuously monitor the beam currents in Hall A (see Fig. 6). The
cavities are composed of loop antennas located where the magnetic
field is maximum. When the beam passes through, the output RF signal
is proportional to the current [15]. As consequence, the BCM response
is linear with respect to the current. Like the Unser, the signals from
the RF cavities are filtered by a V/F converter. Several values of beam
current (measured by the calibrated Unser) are used to the determine
the linear dependence of the BCM as shown in Fig. 7. In general, the
beam current can be then calculated using
ùêº = ùëîBCM ‚ãÖ ùëì + ùëÇ. (1)
where ùëîBCM and ùëÇ are the fit parameters, which correspond to (326.4¬±

given beam induced frequency ùëì, the current ùêº is given by Eq. (1).
Unfortunately the BCM system becomes much less accurate for beam
currents below ‚àº 5 ŒºA.
5. Method overview
The density of the target is well known when loaded but experience
and simulations have shown that the beam current will decrease the
local density of the target fluid in the beam path. The magnitude of
this effect depends on the beam current and target fluid species and
must be quantified to accurately determine cross sections, ratios and
other comparisons of data collected with the multiple gas cells [17]. It
was shown (with the exception of the argon cell) that the target density
reaches equilibrium within a few seconds from when the electron beam

regression.
first impinges on the cell and the density was constant with stable beam
current. The purpose of these measurements and analysis is to develop
a calibration of the target density as a function of beam current for each
gas species.
In order to extract the current dependent density correction, the
LHRS is used to measure the event rate for several beam currents. The
normalized yield is determined by applications of corrections to the raw
event rate. These corrections include: integrated charge during the measurement,
particle identification, acceptance cuts, detector efficiencies,
and live times. The normalized yield ùëånorm is then given by
ùëånorm = ùëÉùëÜ ‚ãÖ ùëÅ
ùëÑ ‚ãÖ ùúñ ‚ãÖ ùêøùëá
, (2)
where ùëÅ is the number of good electrons, ùëÉùëÜ is the prescale factor
of the DAQ system, ùëÑ is the integrated charge, and ùúñ is the combined
efficiency of the detectors, triggers and events selection cuts and ùêøùëá is
the live-time. Each one of these parameters is explained in detail in the
following sections.
5.1. Event selection
To improve counting efficiency and maximize live time, a compound
trigger was used. This trigger required both scintillator planes
and the Cherenkov detector to have signals above threshold in order
to exclude ùúã‚àí events. To extract a good electron sample, several cuts
were applied to the data. These cuts can be summarized in two groups:
acceptance cuts, which assure that the events are selected within an acceptable
spectrometer phase space, and tracking/particle identification
(PID) cuts, which focus on the selection of electrons scattered from the
target fluid. These selection cuts are:
i. Momentum and angular acceptance cuts: Specifically, the ranges
used to determine ùëånorm are |ùõøùëù‚àïùëù| < 4.5%, |ùúÉ ‚àí ùúÉ0| < 30 mrad and
|ùúô| < 25 mrad
ii. Target length cut: This cut excluded events reconstructed back
to the target windows and reduced background by limiting the
effective target length |ùë¶ùë°ùëéùëü| < 8 cm
354

iii. Only events with a single track in the VDC were kept
iv. A particle ID cut was applied to the Cherenkov ADC sum
v. A particle ID cut was applied to the shower calorimeter
With these particle selection cuts, we found that the results remained
stable within 1% run to run. The cut for the reaction vertex was
chosen such that the contamination from the aluminum end-caps was
smaller than 2%. The systematic effects of the aluminum background
events were studied for all the targets are included in the systematic
uncertainties.
5.2. Estimation of efficiencies
A number of efficiencies were applied to the data to produce ùëånorm.
For simplicity, in this analysis only electron events with one track
in the VDC were selected. The ratio between the total number of
electron events with one track and the total number of triggered
electrons (including multi-track and non-track particles) defines the
VDC efficiency.
The trigger efficiency was calculated using another trigger type,
where only both scintillators were required to record the events. In this
sense, the difference between the main trigger and the efficiency trigger
is the Cherenkov detector. The ratio between the events recorded with
the main and the efficiency trigger corresponds to the trigger efficiency.
The Cherenkov efficiency was calculated by selecting a sample of
electrons detected in the calorimeter and determining the number of
events that also were detected in the Cherenkov detector. The calorimeter
efficiency was measured by selecting a sample of electrons in the
Cherenkov detector and counting the number of these electrons that
also fired the calorimeter.
For these measurements, the trigger, Cherenkov, and calorimeters
efficiencies were > 99%. The tracking efficiency was dependent on the
absolute rate in the LHRS and varied for 97 to 99%.
5.3. Live-time calculation
The live-time is related with the limitation of the speed of data
acquisition system (DAQ) to record events. It depends on the electronics,
computers and trigger rate and is calculated using the ratio of the
number of events recorded over the total number of events seen by the
trigger. Typical values for the live-time ranged 93%‚Äì97% depending
the trigger rate in the left LHRS as well as the DAQ prescale setting.
5.4. Total charge
The beam is not completely stable throughout the run; it may trip
off or fluctuate over time. Therefore, we obtained the calibration data
when the beam was mostly stable, and only runs where the average
current is within a window of ¬±2 ŒºA of the requested current are used.
The charge is calculated by integrating the current over time using the
BCM calibration result (see Section 4).
6. Solid target check
The aim of the analysis is to measure the density change when the
beam is on the gas targets using the yield analysis. In order to test
the method, the same analysis is applied to a solid target. The 40Ar
experiment used a carbon foil while for the Tritium experiments used
an aluminum target. Unlike the fluid targets, the solid target density is
not measurably affected by the beam current.
Fig. 8 shows ùëånorm for the solid aluminum target which was calculated
using Eq. (2) for different beam currents. It was normalized with
respect to the lowest current yield value. The plot shows that ùëånorm did
not change to within about 0.5% at the 95% confidence level which is
well within the uncertainty of the measurement.
Fig. 8. Shown is the normalized yield vs. beam current the aluminum solid target used
during the tritium group experiments. Shown are the 95% confidence level bands for
a constant and for a linear regression of the data. These results are consistent with
an ability to determine density changes with our experimental setup to approximately
0.5% at the 95% confidence level.

7. Background contamination
The aluminum windows of the target cell contribute a background
to the measured raw yield for each of the gas targets. To measure this

background (henceforth referred to as contamination) in the case of
the 40Ar experiment, a dummy target with aluminum foils with total
thickness matching the radiation length of the argon filled cell was
used. In the case of the tritium experiments, an empty cell (or dummy
cell) was used. The normalized yields from these targets were then
subtracted from the applicable ùëånorm. To check the current dependence
of this subtraction, a comparison between the background at low and
high current was measured for the dummy/empty targets. The charge
yield given by Eq. (1) was binned in ùë¶ùë°ùëéùëü segments along the target
length, and the ratio of the events at high current to low current was
determined. The ratio was found to be 1.006, which indicates that the
background subtraction is independent of current, as expected.
Fig. 9 shows the spectra of the charge normalized yield for the
empty (or dummy) cell and the tritium gas, for a beam current of 2.5
ŒºA. To optimize the signal to background ratio, events contributing to
the ùëånorm were selected from a symmetric region of ¬±8 cm about the
center of the target. Therefore, the contamination fraction is the ratio
of ùëånorm for the empty cell to ùëånorm for the gas cell of interest. Table 3
summarizes the percentage of background contamination found in the
gas targets for each beam current used in the study.

8. Gas target results
The density correction was determined for each gas species by
measuring ùëånorm as a function of beam current ùêºbeam. The function is
then normalized to 1 for ùêºbeam = 0. The density each gas cell for
zero beam current is the same as that of the load density. Figs. 10,
11(a)‚Äì11(d) show the density correction for the different gas targets.
It is easily seen that the density decreases with the current and that
the behavior of the density correction factor ùëì is modeled well by a
quadratic function

also determined the ratio the density changes. As some of the systematic affects cancel
in the ratio, these uncertainties are slightly smaller then the absolute density change
determinations.
where ùëé, ùëè and ùëê are the fit parameters. Table 4 shows the fit parameters
for each gas species. The density correction factor ùëì(ùêºbeam) is
determined for each gas by substitution of these parameters in Eq. (3).
The density correction factor determined in this manner is valid for
the current range 0 ‚àí 22.5 ŒºA. The error bar in the plots represents
the statistical uncertainty only, and a fit was calculated with respect
to those values with a 95% confidence band in blue. The gray hatched
95% confidence band represents a fit including both statistical and
systematic uncertainties. Since many data analyses require ratios of
different targets, we also provide the ratio of the density changes,
shown in Fig. 12.
8.1. Systematic uncertainties
Several corrections are applied to the data in this analysis, and since
the current is different for every point, the uncertainties are evaluated
at every point. Confidence bands for each fit including the systematic
uncertainties are shown in Figs. 10, 11(a)‚Äì11(d). They include the
uncertainty in the charge, live-time and detector efficiencies.
The BCM monitors are effective over a range from 0 to 100 ŒºA.
However, low current measurements have a slightly higher uncertainty
causing the uncertainty in the charge to be current dependent. The
uncertainty in the current and charge is estimated using the BCM calibration
shown in Fig. 7, together with the error covariance matrix. This
is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the determination
of the density reduction factor ùëì(ùêºbeam).
The background contamination coming from the entrance and exit
windows is also a source of systematic uncertainty. This is due to
the thickness variations in the cell entrance and exit windows which
can be seen in Fig. 9. Therefore, in order to calculate the background
uncertainty in the measurement, the percentage of background was
calculated in ùë¶tar for the values of ¬±4 cm, ¬±7 cm and ¬± 10 cm from the
center of the target. The same normalization procedure was followed
for each of the different cuts in the reaction vertex region to calculate
ùëì(ùêºbeam). Finally, the uncertainty in the background contamination is
given by the standard deviation of the average of multiple ùëì(ùêºbeam)
obtained with the different cuts. The standard deviation was never
more than 1% for each current.
Furthermore, 1% systematic uncertainties were estimated for the
live-time, VDC one-track efficiency, trigger efficiency, detector and cut
efficiencies of the gas Cherenkov and ùúã‚àí rejection.
9. Summary
A novel design for low density gas targets has been used in the
Jefferson Lab electron beam with a number of different gas species.
These cells have proven to be extremely robust and satisfied the
safety requirements necessary for holding 1 kCi of tritium gas. In
this manuscript, we have shown how the local density of these cells
changes when an electron beam passes through them. The 5% to 10%
changes that were measured at 22.5 uA for the different gas species are
consistent with the design expectations. Determination these density
changes was critical for experiments using these cells for cross section
measurements.

A system of modular sealed gas target cells has been developed for use in electron scattering experiments
at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). This system was initially developed to
complete the MARATHON experiment which required, among other species, tritium as a target material. Thus
far, the cells have been loaded with the gas species 3H, 3He, 2H, 1H and 40Ar and operated in nominal beam
currents of up to 22.5 ŒºA in Jefferson Lab‚Äôs Hall A. While the gas density of the cells at the time of loading
is known, the density of each gas varies uniquely when heated by the electron beam. To extract experimental
cross sections using these cells, density dependence on beam current of each target fluid must be determined.
In this study, data from measurements with several beam currents within the range of 2.5 to 22.5 ŒºA on each
target fluid are presented. Additionally, expressions for the beam current dependent fluid density of each target
are developed.
1. Introduction
A modular gas cell target system was developed for use in Jefferson
Lab‚Äôs Hall A for the MARATHON experiment E12-10-103 [1]. The
design was specifically developed to safely contain and operate with
gaseous tritium. The modular design allows gas cells filled with other
species of gas to be installed in the system concurrently. The target
was also adapted for experiments E12-11-112 (ùë•ùëè > 1) [2], E12-14-011
(ùëí, ùëí‚Ä≤ùëù) [3,4], E12-17-003 (Hypernuclear) [5] and E12-14-009 (elastic)
[6]. MARATHON, together with these experiments, became known

as the tritium group of experiments and were performed from December
2017 through November 2018. Prior to the tritium group of
experiments operations, a target cell of this same design was filled with
argon gas and used by experiment E12-14-012 (Argon) [7,8] during
Spring of 2017.
While the performance of the target was an important consideration,
the primary objective of the target system design and construction
was to ensure safe operations with tritium gas under all conditions.
These conditions included target cell preparations, loading, storage,
transportation, installation, removal, and beam operations. This was

accomplished with a modular design, rigorous fabrication and testing,
proper quality assurance and quality control, and multiple layers of
containment/confinement.
In addition to describing of the target, we present the beam current
dependent density of the five gases used with the target system, 3H,
3He, 2H, 1H and 40Ar. The electron beam deposits energy in the cell
end caps as well as in the target fluid. This ionization energy, which is
proportional to the beam current, heats the target fluid causing local
changes in the density. To determine the magnitude of this effect, data
were collected with the left high resolution spectrometer (LHRS) in
Jefferson Lab Experimental Hall A during February 2017 for the 40Ar
target and December 2017 for the other targets. The beam energy for
the study was 2.2 GeV in all cases, The angle and momentum settings
were 17.5‚ó¶ and 1.79 GeV for 40Ar, and 17.0‚ó¶ and 1.99 GeV for the other
fluids. Analysis shows that a simple quadratic polynomial function
normalized to zero current provides an excellent descriptive fit function
for all target fluids.
2. Target system
The modular design allows for multiple cell configurations. It also
enables individual cells to be installed in special configurations of the
standard Hall A cryogenic target such as the 40Ar target (see Fig. 1).
Another feature is that it allows cells to be filled at off-site locations.
The tritium cell was filled at Savannah River Site (SRS) by Savannah
River Tritium Enterprises (SRTE), with 0.1 grams of tritium gas to a
room temperature absolute pressure of 1.38 MPa. It was shipped in
a special purpose transport container called the bulk tritium shipping
package (BTSP). Including the cell this system provided continuous
triple layer confinement throughout the shipping and handling process.
This design also allowed the tritium cell to be placed in a storage
container in Hall A while normal Hall installation activities were completed.
The tritium cell was installed after all other preparatory tasks
were completed. The modular sealed gas cell represents a departure
from previous designs [9]. Fig. 2 shows the design of the gas cell
design. This design is similar to the design proposed in Ref. [10] with
engineering details for the construction and loading of these cell in
Ref. [11].
The configuration of the target system for the tritium experiments
is shown in Fig. 3. In this configuration, there are (from top to bottom)
four cells loaded with 3H, 2H, 1H, and 3He as well as a fifth empty cell
which was used for background measurements. The cells are contained
in a scattering chamber which is under vacuum. The scattering chamber
vacuum is isolated from the upstream beam line vacuum by a 0.2 mm
thick beryllium window. This window is roughly 30 cm upstream of
the target center and is mounted on a reentrant tube that also contains

a 15 cm long tungsten collimator with an inner diameter of 12.7 mm.
The scattering chamber vacuum, with a pumping system directed to
an exhaust stack, provided a second layer of tritium confinement.
An exhaust system, (together with strict access controls) capable of
maintaining a slight negative pressure in the experimental Hall ensured
that the Hall boundary was a third layer of confinement.

a diameter of 12.7 mm. The total volume of the cell (including the nonactive
region) is 33.4¬±0.2 cm3. The thickness of the nearly flat entrance
window and hemispherical exit window is nominally 0.25 mm. The
parameters at the time of loading for each cell are summarized in
Table 1.
Due to machining tolerances, the wall thickness of each cell varies
slightly over its length. Thickness measurements were performed for
each cell at several locations as schematically represented in Fig. 4 and
summarized in Table 2. These measurements were performed with a
Magna Mike 8600 Hall effect thickness gauge which provides a relative
uncertainty of 0.001 mm and an absolute uncertainty of 0.007 mm. The
error shown in Table 2 indicates the standard deviation of multiple
measurements in a 2 mm radius for a given location. The 40Ar cell,
installed in February 2017, was later evacuated and installed as the
empty cell for the tritium group of experiments, so Table 2 shows the
40Ar and the empty cell in a single column.
Once installed in the Hall A scattering chamber, the target cells were
cooled to 40 K with the temperature maintained using a 15 K helium
supply and a controlled heater. This cooling was required to removed
the modest amount of heat generated by the electron beam passing
through the target fluid, cell entrance and cell exit, which, in total,
was about 15 W. To ensure cell integrity, the maximum beam current
permitted on any of the cells was 22.5 ŒºA [11]. The heat generated by
the tritium decay is very small, about 50 mW.
3. Hall A spectrometers
The data were acquired with the left high resolution spectrometer
(LHRS). For a detailed description of the LHRS see Ref. [12]. The basic
components of the LHRS are a normal conducting quadrupole (Q1), a
superconducting quadrupole (Q2), a superconducting dipole (D), and
a superconducting quadrupole (Q3) in a Q‚ÄìQ‚ÄìD‚ÄìQ configuration. The
quadrupoles focus scattered charged particles while the dipole bends
these particles, within a given momentum range, to the detectors.
After passing through the spectrometer magnets, the scattered particles
pass through two vertical drift chambers (VDCs) that provide tracking
information [13]. Two layers of scintillator hodoscopes, s0 and s2, are
on either side of a gas Cherenkov detector filled with CO2 [14]. The
hodoscopes provide trigger and time of flight for the detected particles.
The Cherenkov provides identification of electrons with approximately
99% efficiency and reject ùúã‚àí below a momentum of 4.8 GeV/c. The
last element in the detector stack is the shower calorimeter. Electrons
passing through the calorimeter lead glass blocks induce a cascade of
pair production and bremsstrahlung radiation from which their energy
can be determined [12].
4. Beam current monitor
The beam current monitor system is comprised of three independent
devices and a current source [15]. This is a dedicated system in Hall A
and while independent of the target effects, this system is the dominant
source of systematic uncertainty in the current dependent density
studies presented herein. The system‚Äôs devices consist of a toroidal
sensor (Unser) [16], located between upstream and downstream RF
cavities (BCMs), and a data-acquisition system. A current source, which
is connected to a wire which passes through the Unser, is used to
calibrate the Unser immediately prior to each use of the device and
the Unser is then used to calibrate the BCMs with the electron beam.
The Unser monitor is composed of two identical toroidal coils driven
in opposite directions by an external source. The DC component of the
current flowing through the toroid sensor is detected by a magnetic
modulator. The beam current passing through the cores produces a
flux imbalance, which generates an output signal proportional to the
even harmonics of the frequency of excitation. In the absence of a DC
current, the sum of the signals is zero [15].
The temperature controlled Unser has a sensitivity to beam current
of about 4 mV‚àïŒºA and has a DC offset subtracted stability within
0.1% [15]. The system‚Äôs DC offset does slowly drift, necessitating the
current calibration to be done immediately prior to using it for an
absolute current calibration of the RF cavities. Once calibrated, the
RF cavities are used to continuously monitor the beam current. The
calibrations are checked periodically throughout the course of an experiment.
To put the signals from the Unser and RF cavities into the
scalers of Hall‚Äôs fast data acquisition system, a voltage to frequency
(V/F) converter is used along with a discriminator. Fig. 5 shows the
Unser calibration with a known DC current source, the response of the
system is found to be (249.7 ¬± 9.6) √ó 10‚àí6 ŒºA/Hz.
The beam current monitors (BCM) are 1497 MHz resonant cavities
located immediately before and after the Unser and are used to
continuously monitor the beam currents in Hall A (see Fig. 6). The
cavities are composed of loop antennas located where the magnetic
field is maximum. When the beam passes through, the output RF signal
is proportional to the current [15]. As consequence, the BCM response
is linear with respect to the current. Like the Unser, the signals from
the RF cavities are filtered by a V/F converter. Several values of beam
current (measured by the calibrated Unser) are used to the determine
the linear dependence of the BCM as shown in Fig. 7. In general, the
beam current can be then calculated using
ùêº = ùëîBCM ‚ãÖ ùëì + ùëÇ. (1)
where ùëîBCM and ùëÇ are the fit parameters, which correspond to (326.4¬±

given beam induced frequency ùëì, the current ùêº is given by Eq. (1).
Unfortunately the BCM system becomes much less accurate for beam
currents below ‚àº 5 ŒºA.
5. Method overview
The density of the target is well known when loaded but experience
and simulations have shown that the beam current will decrease the
local density of the target fluid in the beam path. The magnitude of
this effect depends on the beam current and target fluid species and
must be quantified to accurately determine cross sections, ratios and
other comparisons of data collected with the multiple gas cells [17]. It
was shown (with the exception of the argon cell) that the target density
reaches equilibrium within a few seconds from when the electron beam

first impinges on the cell and the density was constant with stable beam
current. The purpose of these measurements and analysis is to develop
a calibration of the target density as a function of beam current for each
gas species.
In order to extract the current dependent density correction, the
LHRS is used to measure the event rate for several beam currents. The
normalized yield is determined by applications of corrections to the raw
event rate. These corrections include: integrated charge during the measurement,
particle identification, acceptance cuts, detector efficiencies,
and live times. The normalized yield ùëånorm is then given by
ùëånorm = ùëÉùëÜ ‚ãÖ ùëÅ
ùëÑ ‚ãÖ ùúñ ‚ãÖ ùêøùëá
, (2)
where ùëÅ is the number of good electrons, ùëÉùëÜ is the prescale factor
of the DAQ system, ùëÑ is the integrated charge, and ùúñ is the combined
efficiency of the detectors, triggers and events selection cuts and ùêøùëá is
the live-time. Each one of these parameters is explained in detail in the
following sections.
5.1. Event selection
To improve counting efficiency and maximize live time, a compound
trigger was used. This trigger required both scintillator planes
and the Cherenkov detector to have signals above threshold in order
to exclude ùúã‚àí events. To extract a good electron sample, several cuts
were applied to the data. These cuts can be summarized in two groups:
acceptance cuts, which assure that the events are selected within an acceptable
spectrometer phase space, and tracking/particle identification
(PID) cuts, which focus on the selection of electrons scattered from the
target fluid. These selection cuts are:
i. Momentum and angular acceptance cuts: Specifically, the ranges

iii. Only events with a single track in the VDC were kept
iv. A particle ID cut was applied to the Cherenkov ADC sum
v. A particle ID cut was applied to the shower calorimeter
With these particle selection cuts, we found that the results remained
stable within 1% run to run. The cut for the reaction vertex was
chosen such that the contamination from the aluminum end-caps was
smaller than 2%. The systematic effects of the aluminum background
events were studied for all the targets are included in the systematic
uncertainties.
5.2. Estimation of efficiencies
A number of efficiencies were applied to the data to produce ùëånorm.
For simplicity, in this analysis only electron events with one track
in the VDC were selected. The ratio between the total number of
electron events with one track and the total number of triggered
electrons (including multi-track and non-track particles) defines the
VDC efficiency.
The trigger efficiency was calculated using another trigger type,
where only both scintillators were required to record the events. In this
sense, the difference between the main trigger and the efficiency trigger
is the Cherenkov detector. The ratio between the events recorded with
the main and the efficiency trigger corresponds to the trigger efficiency.
The Cherenkov efficiency was calculated by selecting a sample of
electrons detected in the calorimeter and determining the number of
events that also were detected in the Cherenkov detector. The calorimeter
efficiency was measured by selecting a sample of electrons in the
Cherenkov detector and counting the number of these electrons that
also fired the calorimeter.
For these measurements, the trigger, Cherenkov, and calorimeters
efficiencies were > 99%. The tracking efficiency was dependent on the
absolute rate in the LHRS and varied for 97 to 99%.
5.3. Live-time calculation
The live-time is related with the limitation of the speed of data
acquisition system (DAQ) to record events. It depends on the electronics,
computers and trigger rate and is calculated using the ratio of the
number of events recorded over the total number of events seen by the
trigger. Typical values for the live-time ranged 93%‚Äì97% depending
the trigger rate in the left LHRS as well as the DAQ prescale setting.
5.4. Total charge
The beam is not completely stable throughout the run; it may trip
off or fluctuate over time. Therefore, we obtained the calibration data
when the beam was mostly stable, and only runs where the average
current is within a window of ¬±2 ŒºA of the requested current are used.
The charge is calculated by integrating the current over time using the
BCM calibration result (see Section 4).
6. Solid target check
The aim of the analysis is to measure the density change when the
beam is on the gas targets using the yield analysis. In order to test
the method, the same analysis is applied to a solid target. The 40Ar
experiment used a carbon foil while for the Tritium experiments used
an aluminum target. Unlike the fluid targets, the solid target density is
not measurably affected by the beam current.
Fig. 8 shows ùëånorm for the solid aluminum target which was calculated
using Eq. (2) for different beam currents. It was normalized with
respect to the lowest current yield value. The plot shows that ùëånorm did
not change to within about 0.5% at the 95% confidence level which is
well within the uncertainty of the measurement.
Fig. 8. Shown is the normalized yield vs. beam current the aluminum solid target used
during the tritium group experiments. Shown are the 95% confidence level bands for
a constant and for a linear regression of the data. These results are consistent with
an ability to determine density changes with our experimental setup to approximately
0.5% at the 95% confidence level.

7. Background contamination
The aluminum windows of the target cell contribute a background
to the measured raw yield for each of the gas targets. To measure this

background (henceforth referred to as contamination) in the case of
the 40Ar experiment, a dummy target with aluminum foils with total
thickness matching the radiation length of the argon filled cell was
used. In the case of the tritium experiments, an empty cell (or dummy
cell) was used. The normalized yields from these targets were then
subtracted from the applicable ùëånorm. To check the current dependence
of this subtraction, a comparison between the background at low and
high current was measured for the dummy/empty targets. The charge
yield given by Eq. (1) was binned in ùë¶ùë°ùëéùëü segments along the target
length, and the ratio of the events at high current to low current was
determined. The ratio was found to be 1.006, which indicates that the
background subtraction is independent of current, as expected.
Fig. 9 shows the spectra of the charge normalized yield for the
empty (or dummy) cell and the tritium gas, for a beam current of 2.5
ŒºA. To optimize the signal to background ratio, events contributing to
the ùëånorm were selected from a symmetric region of ¬±8 cm about the
center of the target. Therefore, the contamination fraction is the ratio
of ùëånorm for the empty cell to ùëånorm for the gas cell of interest. Table 3
summarizes the percentage of background contamination found in the
gas targets for each beam current used in the study.

8. Gas target results
The density correction was determined for each gas species by
measuring ùëånorm as a function of beam current ùêºbeam. The function is
then normalized to 1 for ùêºbeam = 0. The density each gas cell for
zero beam current is the same as that of the load density. Figs. 10,
11(a)‚Äì11(d) show the density correction for the different gas targets.
It is easily seen that the density decreases with the current and that
the behavior of the density correction factor ùëì is modeled well by a
quadratic function

also determined the ratio the density changes. As some of the systematic affects cancel
in the ratio, these uncertainties are slightly smaller then the absolute density change
determinations.
where ùëé, ùëè and ùëê are the fit parameters. Table 4 shows the fit parameters
for each gas species. The density correction factor ùëì(ùêºbeam) is
determined for each gas by substitution of these parameters in Eq. (3).
The density correction factor determined in this manner is valid for
the current range 0 ‚àí 22.5 ŒºA. The error bar in the plots represents
the statistical uncertainty only, and a fit was calculated with respect
to those values with a 95% confidence band in blue. The gray hatched
95% confidence band represents a fit including both statistical and
systematic uncertainties. Since many data analyses require ratios of
different targets, we also provide the ratio of the density changes,
shown in Fig. 12.
8.1. Systematic uncertainties
Several corrections are applied to the data in this analysis, and since
the current is different for every point, the uncertainties are evaluated
at every point. Confidence bands for each fit including the systematic
uncertainties are shown in Figs. 10, 11(a)‚Äì11(d). They include the
uncertainty in the charge, live-time and detector efficiencies.
The BCM monitors are effective over a range from 0 to 100 ŒºA.
However, low current measurements have a slightly higher uncertainty
causing the uncertainty in the charge to be current dependent. The
uncertainty in the current and charge is estimated using the BCM calibration
shown in Fig. 7, together with the error covariance matrix. This
is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the determination
of the density reduction factor ùëì(ùêºbeam).
The background contamination coming from the entrance and exit
windows is also a source of systematic uncertainty. This is due to
the thickness variations in the cell entrance and exit windows which
can be seen in Fig. 9. Therefore, in order to calculate the background
uncertainty in the measurement, the percentage of background was
calculated in ùë¶tar for the values of ¬±4 cm, ¬±7 cm and ¬± 10 cm from the
center of the target. The same normalization procedure was followed
for each of the different cuts in the reaction vertex region to calculate
ùëì(ùêºbeam). Finally, the uncertainty in the background contamination is
given by the standard deviation of the average of multiple ùëì(ùêºbeam)
obtained with the different cuts. The standard deviation was never
more than 1% for each current.
Furthermore, 1% systematic uncertainties were estimated for the
live-time, VDC one-track efficiency, trigger efficiency, detector and cut
efficiencies of the gas Cherenkov and ùúã‚àí rejection.
9. Summary
A novel design for low density gas targets has been used in the
Jefferson Lab electron beam with a number of different gas species.
These cells have proven to be extremely robust and satisfied the
safety requirements necessary for holding 1 kCi of tritium gas. In
this manuscript, we have shown how the local density of these cells
changes when an electron beam passes through them. The 5% to 10%
changes that were measured at 22.5 uA for the different gas species are
consistent with the design expectations. Determination these density
changes was critical for experiments using these cells for cross section
measurements.
