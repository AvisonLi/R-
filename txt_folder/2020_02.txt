Abstract The high-density behavior of stellar matter composed
of nucleons and leptons under β equilibrium and
charge neutrality conditions is studied with the Skyrme
parametrizations shown to be consistent (Consistent Skyrme
Parametrizations, CSkP) with nuclear matter, pure neutron
matter, symmetry energy and its derivatives in a set of 11 constraints
[Dutra et al., Phys. Rev. C 85, 035201 (2012)]. The
predictions of these parametrizations on the tidal deformabilities
related to the GW170817 event are also examined.
The CSkP that produce massive neutron stars give a range of
11.86km  R1.4  12.55km for the canonical star radius, in
agreement with other theoretical predictions. It is shown that
the CSkP are compatible with the region of masses and radii
obtained from the analysis of recent data from LIGO and
Virgo Collaboration (LVC). A correlation between dimensionless
tidal deformability and radius of the canonical star is
found, namely,Λ1.4 ≈ 3.16×10−6R7.35
1.4 , with results for the
CSkP compatible with the recent range of Λ1.4 = 190+390
−120
from LVC. An analysis of the Λ1 × Λ2 graph shows that all
the CSkP are compatible with the recent bounds obtained by
LVC. Finally, the universal correlation between the moment
of inertia and the deformability of a neutron star, named the
I -Love relation, is verified for the CSkP; it is also shown to
be consistent with the prediction for the moment of inertia
of the PSR J0737-3039 primary component pulsar.
1 Introduction
Neutron stars are incredible natural laboratories for the study
of nuclear matter at extreme conditions of isospin asymmetry
and density (ρ) [1,2]. The properties of nuclear matter at such
high densities are mostly governed by the equation of state
(EOS), which correlates pressure (p), energy density () and
a e-mail: odilon.ita@gmail.com
other thermodynamical quantities. From the terrestrial experiments,
nuclear matter properties are mostly constrained up
to saturation density, ρ0 ≈ 0.15 fm−3 ≈ 2.8 × 1014 g/cm3
[3–6]. The EOS correlating P, E and ρ is the sole ingredient
to determine the relationship between the mass and radius of
a neutron star by using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff
(TOV) equations [7,8]. It also plays a vital role in determining
other star properties such as the moment of inertia
and tidal deformability [9,10]. These last two quantities are
shown to be correlated according to the so-called I -Love
relation [10,11]. The measurements of the neutron star spin,
radius, and gravitational redshift provideweak constraints on
the EOS as these measurements depend on the detailed modeling
of the radiation mechanism and are subject to a lot of
systematic errors [12,13]. However, the recent observation
of gravitational wave (GW) emission from the first binary
neutron star merger event, GW170817, provided new expectations
to constrain the EOS in more efficient ways [14,15].
Since 2015, the observation of the GW emission from
the binary compact objects, by the LIGO [16] and Virgo
[17] Collaborations, opened a platform to study the GW
and related physics in more adequate ways. The GW170817
event, observed on 17 August 2017, has a special importance
in nuclear physics since it consists of the emergence
of GW from a binary system of neutron stars. It coincides
with the detection of the γ -ray burst GRB170817 [18,19]
and the components were verified as neutron stars by various
electromagnetic spectrum observations [20–24]. Hence, the
GW170817 offers an opportunity to constrain the EOS from
the tidal deformability data [9,25–28], which establishes a
relation between the internal structure of the neutron star
and the emitted GW.
In the present context, we use the Skyrme model [29–32]
in order to explore the possible constraints on the EOS by
the observation of the GW170817 event. In the work of Ref.
[33], the authors have studied the nuclear matter character-

32 Page 2 of 11 Eur. Phys. J. A (2020) 56:32
istics of symmetric and asymmetric matter at saturation as
well as at high densities by using 240 parametrizations of
the Skyrme energy density functional. Following this work,
it was observed that 16 parametrizations, namely, GSkI [34],
GSkII [34], KDE0v1 [35], LNS [36], MSL0 [37], NRAPR
[38], Ska25s20 [39], Ska35s20 [39], SKRA [40], Skxs20
[41], SQMC650 [42], SQMC700 [42], SkT1 [43,44], SkT2
[43,44], SkT3 [43,44] and SV-sym32 [45], satisfy all the
chosen 11 constraints analyzed in Ref. [33] from symmetric
nuclear matter, pure neutron matter, and a mixture of both
related with the symmetry energy and its derivatives [46].
This set was named Consistent Skyrme Parametrizations
(CSkP), which acronym is used in the present manuscript.
These parametrizations offer a predictive power starting from
sub-saturation density to very high density at very high
isospin asymmetry, what has motivated us to analyze the
stellar matter behavior for the CSkP, in particular, the tidal
deformability related to the GW170817 event.
We point out that the constraints analyzed in Ref. [33]
were chosen by collecting previous existing constraints in
the literature at the time. In that sense, they are not unique
and can be subject to improvements and/or updates. Actually,
in subsequent work, relativistic mean-field models were
analyzed by a set of updated constraints [47,48] in comparison
with those used in Ref. [33]. However, we also remark
here that the main purpose of Ref. [33] was to establish some
general criteria and analyse the models according to them.
The purpose of the present paper is not to justify the criteria
chosen in Ref. [33], but to use the models consistent with all
those chosen constraints to verifywhether (or not) they could
also satisfy the new constraints imposed by the GW170817
event.
We try to correlate the tidal deformability of the canonical
neutron star (Λ1.4) and the corresponding radius (R1.4)
for the CSkP by addressing a transparent relation between
Λ1.4 and R1.4 as a power law. Usually, the proportionality
relation Λ ∝ R5, which is based on the definition
Λ = (2/3)k2(R/M)5, with M being the neutron star mass,
is cited in the literature. It is worth noticing that this proportionality
is not exact since the Love number k2 depends
on the radius R through a complicated second order differential
equation. In recent studies, various relations between
the Λ1.4 and R1.4 are obtained with different models, like
the Skyrme [49] and relativistic mean-field [50] ones. Here,
we study this correlation with CSkP. The predictions of the
CSkP regarding the values for Λ1.4 and the tidal deformabilities
of the binary neutron star system, namely, Λ1 and Λ2
are also presented. The verification of the I -Love relation,
and the predictions for the dimensionless moment of inertia
of the PSR J0737-3039 primary component pulsar, obtained
from the CSkP, are also performed.
This manuscript is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we
briefly outline the theoretical formalism of the Skyrme model
in nuclear and neutron star matter. In Sect. 3, we discuss
the predictions of CSkP concerning the recent constraints
obtained from the GW170817 event and verify the I -Love
relation. Special attention is given to the tidal deformability
of the binary neutron star system. We conclude the
manuscript with a brief summary in Sect. 4.

2.2 Neutron star matter
For a correct treatment of the stellar matter, one needs to
implement charge neutrality and β-equilibrium conditions
under the weak processes, n → p +e− + ¯νe, and its inverse
process p + e− → n + νe. For densities in which μe
exceeds the muon mass, the reactions e− → μ
− + νe + ¯νμ,
p + μ
− → n + νμ, and n → p + μ
− + ¯νμ energetically
favor the emergence of muons. Here, we consider that neutrinos
are able to escape the star due to their extremely small
cross-sections at zero temperature. By taking these assumptions
into account, we can write the total energy density and
pressure of the stellar system for the Skyrme model, respectively,
as
E(ρ, ρe, yp)

where (ρ, yp) and p(ρ, yp) are given in the Eqs. (1) and
(5), respectively. The chemical equilibrium and the charge
neutrality conditions are
μn(ρ, yp) − μp(ρ, yp) = μe(ρe) (9)
and
ρp(ρ, yp) − ρe = ρμ(ρe), (10)
whereμp andμn are found from Eq. (6),μe = ¯hc(3π2ρe)1/3,
ρp = ypρ, ρμ = [(μ2
μ
−m2
μ)3/2]/(3π2 ¯h3c3), and μμ = μe,
for mμc2 = 105.7 MeV and massless electrons (the ultrarelativistic
limit is a suitable assumption here since the electron
rest mass is around 0.5 MeV). Regarding the muons,
their energy density and pressure are given by the last terms
of Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively, with the degeneracy factor
equal to 2. Thus, for each input density ρ, the quantities ρe
and yp are calculated by simultaneously solving conditions
(9) and (10), along with the definitions of ρμ and μμ (both
functions of ρe) previously given in the text.
The properties of a spherically symmetric static neutron
star can be studied by taking the energy density and pressure
as input to thewidely known TOVequations,which are given

where the solution is constrained to the following two conditions
at the neutron star center: P(0) = Pc (central pressure),
andm(0) = 0 (centralmass). Furthermore, at the star surface
123
32 Page 4 of 11 Eur. Phys. J. A (2020) 56:32
one has P(R) = 0 and m(R) ≡ M, with R being the neutron
star radius. These equations are given in gravitational
units, in which G = 1 = c [51]. In this specific unit system,
mass can be expressed in length units and energy density as
inverse length square, as for example in km−2. On the other
hand, in natural units (¯h = c = 1), energy density and pressure
can also be expressed in fm−4, as stated immediately
after Eq. (5). By mixing gravitational and natural units, one
finds 1 fm−4 = 2.6115 × 10−4 km−2 [51], which is used to
express energy density and pressure in units of km−2. In this
case, mass and radius have the same unit, namely, km (with
1 M = 1.4766 km [51]).
In order to solve the TOV equations in this work, we take
E and P given in Eqs. (7) and (8) as the EOS that describes
the neutron star core. For the crust, we consider the different
regions defined as the outer and the inner crust. We
describe the outer crust by the EOS developed by Baym,
Pethick and Sutherland (BPS) [52] in a density region from
ρ = 6.3 × 10−12 fm−3 to ρ = 2.5 × 10−4 fm−3. The exact
range is not known, but the outer crust is estimated to exist
at densities around 104 g/cm3 to 4×1011 g/cm3, i.e., around
5 × 10−12 fm−3 to 2 × 10−4 fm−3; see Refs. [52,53], for
instance. Our choice for this range is compatible with this
estimation. A similar range was also used in Ref. [54]. For
the inner crust region, on the other hand, we impose a polytropic
form for the total pressure as a function of the total
energy density, namely, P(E) = A+BE4/3 [53,55,56], from
ρ = 2.5 × 10−4 fm−3 to ρ = ρt . Here, ρt is related to the
core–crust transition, in our case estimated from the thermodynamical
method described in Refs. [57–59], for instance.
Such a procedure establishes that the transition density is
defined by the crossing of the EOS with the spinodal section,
as one can see in Ref. [60]. A and B are constants found by
imposing the matching between the outer and the inner crust,
and between the inner crust and the core. The EOS for the
KDEv01 parametrization is shown in Fig. 1 and illustrates
the piecewise structure we use in this work.
The remaining CSkP follow the same pattern.
2.3 Tidal deformability and moment of inertia
In order to perform a detailed analysis concerning the prediction
of the CSkP on the recent GW170817 event, a very
important quantity has to be computed, namely, the tidal
deformability. It is one of the observed quantities in the binary
neutron star system [14,15], which plays amajor role in constraining
hadronic EOS. The induced quadrupole moment
Qi j in one neutron star of a binary system due to the static
external tidal field Ei j created by the companion star can be
written as [9,26]
Qi j = −λEi j . (13)

The dimensionless tidal deformability Λ (i.e., the dimensionless
version of λ) is connected with the compactness
parameter C = M/R through
Λ = 2k2

The tidal Love number k2 is obtained:

. (19)
In order to find y(r ), Eq. (17) has to be solved as part of a coupled
system containing the TOV equations given in Eqs. (11)
and (12).
The dimensionless tidal deformabilities of a binary neutron
star system, namely, Λ1 and Λ2, can be combined to
yield the weighted average as [14]
˜Λ

(m1 + 12m2)m41
Λ1 + (m2 + 12m1)m42
Λ2
(m1 + m2)5 , (20)
where m1 and m2 are masses of the two companion stars.
Finally, in order to verify whether the I -Love relation also
applies to the CSkP, we solve Hartle’s slow rotation equation
given in Refs. [10,61,62], namely,
0 = [r − 2m(r )]d2ω

coupled to the TOV equations. Since the binary system
related to the GW170817 event rotates slowly, according to
Ref. [10], Hartle’s method can be safely used.
From the solution ω(r ), one determines the moment of
inertia through the relation I = R3(1 − ωR)/2, with ωR ≡
ω(R). The dimensionless version of this quantity is defined
as ¯ I ≡ I/M3. The linearized version of Eq. (21) is given by
r

In this case, the boundary conditions are ζ = 0 at the center,
and I = [ζ/(3 + ζ)]R3/2 at the surface. This formulation
is easier to be numerically integrated since it is a first-order
differential equation.
3 Results and discussions
As all the CSkP come from a nonrelativistic mean-field
model, at zero temperature regime, the causal limit may be
broken at the high-density region, since the sound velocity
(vs ) increases with density, or equivalently, with energy density.
However, for the CSkP we verify that v2

Fig. 2 Squared sound velocity as a function of total energy density for
the CSkP
exceeds c2 = 1 only at very high energy density values, as
we can see in Fig. 2.
From this figure, one can verify that the CSkP obey the
causal limit up to a range of E  10 fm−4. By comparing
these results with those obtained for relativistic mean-field
(RMF) parametrizations in Fig. 2 of Ref. [63,64], a clear difference
in behavior is observed. The RMF parametrizations
present a saturation for the sound velocity, unlike the Skyrme
ones, that always increase. Despite this increasing dependence,
Fig. 2 shows that it is possible to describe neutron star
matter with CSkP within a particular range of energy densities.
The description of global properties of neutron stars
by other different Skyrme parametrizations can be found,
for instance, in Refs. [10,49,65–71]. Notice that the curves
that end below an energy density of around 8 fm−4 refer to
models that stop converging at these lower densities. Had
we plotted the sound velocity as a function of the baryonic
density, the behavior would be similar. For all models, the
baryonic density corresponding to the energy density equal
to 2 (6) fm−4 is of the order of 0.4 (1.0) fm−3 and we have a
ratio of 2.4 (6) times their saturation densities. Furthermore,
other nonrelativistic models such as the Gogny, simple effective
interaction (SEI), and momentum-dependent interaction
(MDI) models, based on finite range interactions unlike the
Skyrme model, are also used in neutron star calculations; see
Refs. [56,57,72–74].
Themass–radius profiles predicted by theCSkP are shown
in Fig. 3. In this figure, horizontal bands in magenta and green
colors indicate, respectively, the observational data of pulsar
masses of PSR J1614-2230 [75] and PSR J0348+0432 [76].
We also show the empirical constraints for the mass–radius
profile for the cold dense matter inside the neutron star. They
were obtained from a Bayesian analysis of type-I x-ray burst
observations by Nättilä et al. in Ref. [77] (outer orange and
inner red bands), and from a mass–radius coming from six

inner black bands). In the same figure, there is also represented
by the turquoise band the region of masses and radii
obtained from the analysis of theGW170817 event regarding
the binary neutron star system [15].
These observations imply that the neutron star mass predicted
by any theoretical model should reach the limit of
M ∼ 2.0M. From the results, we find that the maximum
masses obtained by the GSkI, Ska35s20, MSL0, NRAPR,
and KDE0v1 parametrizations are in agreement with at
least one of these boundaries [75,76]. Very recently, another
massive millisecond pulsar was confirmed, namely, MSP
J0740+6620, with a mass of 2.14+0.20
−0.18M within 95.4%
credibility or 2.14+0.10
−0.09M within 68.3% credibility [79].
Indeed, four of the models mentioned above, namely, GSkI,
Ska35s20, MSL0 and KDE0v1, also lie within the former
mass limit of this pulsar (2.14+0.20
−0.18M), as one can verify
from the results presented in Table 1.
Furthermore, the radii obtained from these parametrizations
for the canonical star of M = 1.4M are also inside
the bands calculated in Refs. [77,78]. The remaining CSkP
underestimate the observed data regarding the neutron star
mass. Finally, concerning the GW170817 constraint, one
can verify that all the CSkP are entirely compatible with
this particular restriction. The exception is the SQMC650
parametrization, which satisfies the constraint only partially.
In Table 1 we also present some properties regarding the
CSkP, namely, the transition point (transition density, energy
density and pressure) found by the thermodynamical method
[57–59], and neutron star matter quantities. For the latter,
we show the maximum neutron star mass and corresponding
radius, compactness and central energy density. We also
tabulate the radius and compactness related to the canonical
neutron star. It is worth mentioning that the central energy
density of all CSkP are compatible with the causal limit, as
one can verify from Fig. 2.

In the recent literature, a lot of efforts have been made
to constrain the radius of the canonical neutron star; see,
for instance, Refs. [49,80–84]. In Ref. [49], Tuhin Malik
et al. have discussed this constraint by using Skyrme and
RMF models and their calculations suggest the range of
11.82 km  R1.4  13.72 km. By using a set of more
realistic models and the neutron skin values as a new constraint,
Fattoyev et al. have shown the upper limit for R1.4
as 13.76 km [50]. In Ref. [80], Yeunhwan Lim et al. have
used chiral effective field theory and constraints from nuclear
experiments to establish the range of 10.36 km  R1.4 
12.87 km.Most et al. have studied the constraint on R1.4 with
a large number of EOSwith pure hadronicmatterwithout any
kind of phase transition [81]. They found the value of R1.4
inside the range of 12.00 km  R1.4  13.45 km, with the
most likely value of R1.4 = 12.39 km. From the above discussion,
we can estimate a specific range for R1.4 encompassing
the previous ones as 10.36 km  R1.4  13.76 km. Our calculations
for R1.4 from the CSkP show a minimum value of
10.36 km (SQMC650 parametrization), while the maximum
value is given by 12.55 km (Ska35s20 parameter set). Both
maximum and minimum values present very good agreement
with the composite range. As a consequence, the five
CSkP predicting neutron star mass around two solar masses,
namely, GSkI, KDE0v1, MSL0,NRAPR, and Ska35s20, also
present R1.4 compatible with the range mentioned above. The
minimum value of this quantity is obtained by the KDE0v1
parametrization: R1.4 = 11.86 km,while themaximum value
is found by the Ska35s20 set, namely, R1.4 = 12.55 km. This
number is close to the most likely value of R1.4 given in Ref.
[81], namely, R1.4 = 12.39 km.
In searching for other possible correlations in the context
of the binary neutron star system, one can notice from
Eq. (15) that Λ ∝ R5 is not a good assumption, since the
tidal Love number k2 depends on the neutron star radius
in a nontrivial way, as seen in Eq. (16). In this context,
we try to find a correlation between the radius and tidal
deformability for the CSkP for the canonical star, the one
with M = 1.4M. The obtained results for Λ1.4 as a function
of R1.4 are shown in Fig. 4, with a similar qualitative
behavior in comparison with the study performed in
Ref. [85], for instance. From the points shown in the figure,
we could establish a fitting curve correlating Λ1.4 as a
function of R1.4, namely, Λ1.4 ≈ 3.16 × 10−6R7.35
1.4 . This
correlation presents different numbers in comparison with
those found from predictions of EOS constructed by chiral
effective field theory at low densities and the perturbative
QCD at very high baryon densities using polytropes
[86], several energy density functional within RMF models
[50], and both RMF and Skyrme Hartree–Fock energy density
functionals [49]. In these cited works, the authors found
Λ1.4 ≈ 2.88 × 10−6R7.5
1.4 [86], Λ1.4 ≈ 7.76 × 10−4R5.28

[50], and Λ1.4 ≈ 9.11 × 10−5R6.13

Λ1.4 = 190+390
−120 obtained by the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations [15]
related to the canonical star
sis performed in Ref. [48] by using a set of consistent RMF
parametrizations, pointed out to Λ1.4 ≈ 2.65 × 10−5R6.58
1.4 .
These different fittings point towards the non-existence of
an universal power law of λ or Λ as a function of R, as one
could naively think by looking at Eqs. (14) and (15).
For the sake of completeness, in Fig. 5 we plot the dimensionless
tidal deformability Λ of a static neutron star as a
function of its mass for the CSkP. The tidal deformability
decreases nonlinearly with the neutron star mass for all
parametrizations. At M = 1.4M, the resulting values of Λ
stand within a range of around 100–350 for the CSkP, which
are within the upper limit of Λ1.4  800 of LIGO + Virgo
gravitational detection [14], and also the recent updated range
of Λ1.4 = 190+390
−120 [15].
In Fig. 6 we plot the tidal deformabilities Λ1 and Λ2 of
the binary neutron star system with component masses of m1
and m2 (m1 > m2). The diagonal dotted line corresponds to

Fig. 6 Tidal deformability parameters predicted by the CSkP for the
case of high-mass (Λ1) and low-mass (Λ2) components of the observed
GW170817 event. The 90% and 50% confidence lines were taken from
recent findings of Ref. [15]
theΛ1 = Λ2 case inwhichm1 = m2. The analysis takes into
account the range for m1 given by 1.365  m1/M  1.60,
as pointed out in Ref. [14]. The mass of the companion star,
m2, is calculated through the relationship between m1, m2
and the chirp mass given by
Mc = (m1m2)3/5
(m1 + m2)1/5 . (24)
In this equation, Mc is fixed at the observed value of
1.188M [14]. The upper and lower dash lines correspond to
the 90% and 50% confidence limits, respectively, which are
obtained from the recent analysis of the GW170817 event
[15]. This figure shows that all 16 CSkP are completely
inside the 90% credible region predicted by the GW170817
data [15]. Other kind of models, such as some relativistic
ones [48,87] also present good agreement with this particular
region predicted by the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations.
We also calculate the ranges related to the mass weighted
tidal deformability as defined in Eq. (20) by using Mc =
1.188M and the aforementioned variations of m1 and m2.
The results are presented in Table 2.
One can see that all the CSkP present ˜Λin full agreement
with the range determined in Ref. [14], namely, ˜Λ  800,
when the chirp mass given byMc = 1.188M [14] is used.
Furthermore, if we use the value of Mc = 1.186M [88],
the results presented in Table 2 change only slightly. For
instance, for the GSkI parametrization the range changes to
424  ˜Λ  432.
Regarding the calculation of deformabilities, it is worth
mentioning that the inner crust–core phase transition may
be slightly different if obtained from the thermodynamical,
dynamical approximations or from the interface between the
pasta and the homogeneous phases, as can be found in Ref.

[89]. Moreover, in Ref. [53] it is claimed that the inner crust
does not play an important role in the calculation of the
deformability, what was corroborated in Ref. [90], where the
pasta phase was explicitly taken into account to describe the
inner crust. Hence, the differences found by different models
due to the use of another prescription (a dynamical instead of
a thermodynamical method) would be consistent and would
certainly lead to the same conclusions.
Finally, we show in Fig. 7 the dimensionless moment of
inertia calculated from the CSkP. Since in our calculations
Eq. (21), or Eqs. (22) and (23) are solved coupled to the
TOV equations and also to Eq. (17), one can simultaneously
extract information regarding M, Λ and I (or ¯ I ). In panel
(a), in which we show ¯ I as a function of Λ, it is verified that
all CSkP are indistinguishable. This universality is known as
the I -Love relation. In Ref. [10], this feature was obtained
for parametrizations coming from the relativistic mean-field
model and the Skyrme one. For the latter, among the 24
Skyrme parametrizations employed in Ref. [10], only one
is also included in the set we have employed in the present
work, namely, the KDE0v1 parametrization. Here, we confirm
the universal behavior of the ¯ I × Λ curves for all the
CSkP. The fitting curve generated in Ref. [10] is also shown
in Fig. 7a.
In Ref. [10], there was also obtained the range of ¯ I ≡
¯ I (M) = 11.10+3.64
−2.28 for the PSR J0737-3039 primary component
pulsar with mass M = 1.338M. Such numbers
were determined through the relation between Λ ≡ Λ(M)
and Λ1.4, known as the binary-Love relation. The combination
between the I -Love and the binary-Love relations, along
with the GW170817 constraint of Λ1.4 = 190+390
−120 coming
from the LIGO and Virgo Collaboration, allowed the authors

4 Summary and conclusions
In this paper we have revisited the Skyrme parametrizations
that were shown to satisfy several nuclear matter constraints
in Ref. [33], named as the consistent Skyrme parametrizations
(CSkP), and confronted them with astrophysical constraints
and predictions on the GW170817 event studied by
the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations recently [14,15]. Concerning
the applicability of these nonrelativistic models at the
high-density regime of the stellar matter, we have shown that
causality is not broken at the energy density range of interest,
as one can see from Fig. 2, and from the comparison with the
central energy density obtained from the CSkP and presented
in Table 1. Our calculations also pointed out to a radius range
of 10.36 km  R1.4  12.55 kmaccording to the predictions
of the CSkP. It was also shown that only the GSkI, KDE0v1,
MSL0, NRAPR, and Ska35s20 parametrizations are able to
produce neutron stars with mass around 2M, value established
form observational analysis of PSR J1614-2230 [75]
and PSR J0348+0432 [76] pulsars. They also establish the
more stringent range of 11.86 km  R1.4  12.55 km for
the canonical star radius. This range is similar to the one
found in Ref. [91], namely, 11 km  R1.4  12 km, in
which the authors analyzed five out of more than two hundred
Skyrme parametrizations also investigated in the work.
In their study, they also used a piecewise way to construct
the EOS, namely, the BPS equation for the outer crust, the
same form of the polytropic equation of state as in the present
work (P = A+ BE4/3), the Skyrme model for the core, and
finally, another polytropic form (P ∼ ργ ) for the density
region above 3ρ0.
Concerning the predictions of the CSkP on the recent
GW170817 event, it was shown that all CSkP, except the
SQMC650 one, present a mass–radius profile in full agreement
with the constraint region given in Ref. [15]. Furthermore,
by investigating the results regarding the canonical star
(M = 1.4M), our results pointed out to a correlation given
byΛ1.4 ≈ 3.16×10−6R7.35
1.4 between the dimensionless tidal
deformability and the radius. From this correlation, we found
that the CSkP present values of Λ1.4 completely inside the
ranges of Λ1.4  800 [14] and even the recent one given by
Λ1.4 = 190+390
−120 [15], as one can see in Figs. 4 and 5. We
have also calculated the dimensionless tidal deformabilities
of the binary neutron star system,Λ1 andΛ2 (see Fig. 6), and
found that the CSkP are completely inside the region defined
by 90% credible region in the Λ1 × Λ2 graph, predicted by
the recent paper from LIGO and Virgo Collaboration [15].
In addition, we verified that the prediction presented in Ref.
[10] on the dimensionless moment of inertia for the PSR
J0737-3039 pulsar, namely, ¯ I = 11.10+3.64
−2.28, is attained by
the CSkP.
As a last comment, we mention that our study refers only
to the predictions of the CSkP with their equations of state
given in Eqs. (1)–(6), i.e., no hyperons and no hadron–quark
phase transitions are considered. Specifically for the first
treatment, the interactions between hyperons and nucleons
and between hyperons themselves, which are unknown at
present, can be modeled in different ways; see for instance,
Refs. [63,64,69]. For the latter, there is not a unique model
that effectively mimics QCD, which makes this study also
model dependent from the quark matter considerations. A
more detailed and complete study of how these treatments
can affect the deformability calculations will be addressed in
future work.
