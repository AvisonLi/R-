Abstract: (1) Background: Population aging has been accelerating in China since the 1990s, and the
number of people over 65 reached 190 million in 2020. However, the spatial distribution of the aged
is not homogeneous; in rural areas, the aged population accounted for 17.72% of the total population,
whereas in urban areas, it accounted for 11.11%, which is 6.61 p.p. less. Therefore, this study aims to
examine the spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors of population aging in rural China from
2000 to 2020. (2) Methods: First, Getis–Ord Gi* was used to analyze the spatial clustering of the aged
population in rural China. Then, standard deviational ellipse was used to characterize the temporal
trend of the spatial clustering of population aging in rural China. Finally, potential influencing factors
that could have contributed to the spatial–temporal patterns were analyzed using a novel spatial
statistical package “Geographical Detector”. (3) Results: (a). Aging in rural populations increased
and occurred throughout China from 2000 to 2020. (b). The spatial patterns of aging in China are
roughly divided by the Hu Line, which is the population density boundary of China. (c). The mean
center of the aged population tended to orient around a northeast-to-southwest major axis over the
past 20 years, contrary to the internal migration pattern that flows from north to south. (d). The
population age structure, longevity rate, and fertility rate were the predominant factors of aging in
rural areas. (4) Conclusions: As the aged population is rapidly increasing in rural areas in China in
a spatially heterogeneous fashion, governments and private sectors need to collaborate to alleviate
the problem.

1. Introduction
Population aging is becoming one of the most crucial social transformations of the 21st
century and is being given close attention and more importance worldwide. As noted by
the World Population Prospects 2019, one in six people in the world will be over the age of
65 by 2050 (16%), up from one in eleven in 2019 (9%) [1]. The world population is growing
older, while the growth varies greatly across regions [2]. Take China as an example. The
number of the aged population increased from 88.21 to 102.4 million from 2000 to 2020. By
the end of 2020, China had a population of just over 1.41 billion, of which 0.191 billion were
over 65 years old, accounting for 13.5% of the total population [3]. China’s population is
projected to peak at about 1.35 to 1.46 billion in 2035 and will then continue to decline until
2050, but the trend of population aging will continue.
In particular, the aged population is distributed at different levels in rural and urban
areas in China. In rural areas, population aging is more severe than that in urban areas, and
the problem is aggravated by generally less developed infrastructures and fewer healthcare
facilities in rural areas. In pursuit of economic profit and personal development, many
people in rural areas migrate to “big cities”, leaving the old (as well as the young) in their
rural homes, creating the so-called “empty hearted village” and “empty nester family”
phenomenon. Due to the limitation of urban–rural dualism, migrant workers do not have
the same welfare, healthcare protection, or education opportunities for their children as
their urban counterparts. As a result, population aging in China has a different pattern
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315631 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph

in rural and urban areas. Social, economic, and health problems associated with the leftbehind
elderly in rural China need to be dealt with scientifically and sustainably to improve
the well-being of all.
Over the past 40 years, the studies on China’s population aging have always been a
focus for the scientific community and governmental organizations. Traditionally, studies
on population aging in China mostly focus on analyzing the current situation and development
trends of China’s population aging and point out that China’s population aging
presents significant characteristics such as a large-scale elderly population, fast growth rate,
uneven distribution of aging, and “getting old before getting rich” [4]. Due to the vigorous
development of geographic information technology in the 1990s, the spatial analysis
method is widely applied to the study of the aging population, such as Global Moran’s I
and kernel density analysis, and considerable literature has grown up around the theme
of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the aging population distribution in recent
decades [5,6]. In addition, the research to date has fully described the influencing factors of
population aging, including the impact of aging on society, economy, urbanization, and
rural development, as well as the natural environmental factors [7,8]. However, existing
research mainly focuses on qualitative studies on the overall pattern of aging, the general
policy on population aging, and the differences between rural and urban areas in
China; the combined research on the spatiotemporal pattern, especially the differences
in aging between rural and urban areas and its potential influencing factors are still in
their early stages. Moreover, most research pays less attention to rural areas. Considering
the importance of how continued population aging in the coming decades influences the
sustainability of rural regions and positive aging welfare, it is necessary to analyze the
spatial patterns of rural aging in China with the newest population census data in 2020.
This study set out to examine the spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors of
population aging in rural China from 2000 to 2020 using county-level panel data. Based
on a large spatial scale and time span, we comprehensively used GIS analysis tools to
study the spatial and temporal distribution law and influencing factors of China’s rural
population aging. The aims of this study were to reveal the comprehensive deepening law
of rural population aging and provide a scientific basis for active aging development and
population policy adjustment in China.
2. Materials
In this part, we define the study area, and the indicators for evaluating the degree
of aging of the rural population are described. Then, a system of variables influencing
the aging of rural population is shared, and the reasons for selecting these variables are
explained. Finally, the data sources used are described.
2.1. Study Area
Administrative divisions are areas that are divided hierarchically to facilitate administration
by the country. According to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China,
the administrative regions are divided into four levels: provincial, prefecture, county,
and township. Currently, there are 34 provincial-level administrative regions (including
23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities directly under the central Government,
and 2 special administrative regions), 333 prefecture-level administrative regions,
2846 county-level administrative regions, and 38,755 township-level administrative regions
in China. Among them, townships, i.e., rural areas, are the most basic administrative
units [9]. Furthermore, to reflect the social and economic development of various zones,
administrative units on mainland China are divided into seven areas with similar economic
development levels, and relatively uniform geographic locations. These are Central China,
Eastern China, Northern China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Southern China, and
Southwest China [10] (Figure 1). As the statistical data of township administrative districts
is insufficient and difficult to obtain, this paper studies the rural population aging in China
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 3 of 18
based on the county-level administrative units (2846 in total). In addition, as there is no
data for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, they are excluded from this study.
Figure 1. Agglomeration of provincial level administrative units.
2.2. Evaluation Index of Rural Population Aging
There are various measures of population aging, including the ratio of the elderly
population, the ratio of the elderly to the young, the dependency ratio of the elderly
population, and the median age of the population, among which the proportion of the
elderly population in total is the most used measure. According to the aging standard of the
United Nations in 1956, when the ratio of old people to total is greater than or equal to 7%,
it is considered to be entering an aging society; if it is greater than 14%, it is considered as a
hyper-aged society [11]. Therefore, this paper defines the proportion of the population aged
65 and over in the total population as an index to measure the degree of rural population
aging (RPA) in each county.
In order to better compare the degree of aging in different regions, this paper refers to
the international standards and divides RPA into three different aging classes. If the RPA is
less than or equal to 7%, it is considered a young type of rural; if the RPA is greater than or
less than 14%, it is named an aged type of rural; if the RPA is greater than 14%, it is called a
hyper-aged type of rural.
2.3. Construction of the Indicator System
Aging is essentially a special population age structure, and the age change in the
population plays a decisive role in its development and evolution. In addition, aging
is also affected by the local population base, changes in population mechanical growth,
economic development status, healthcare accessibility, and education background. Due to
the complex and diverse topography, climate, and hydrological conditions in China, there
are large differences in population and economic development between the east and the
west. Therefore, this paper constructs an influential factor system of rural aging through
the four levels of population, socioeconomics, healthcare, and education to explore the
influencing factors affecting the spatiotemporal pattern of rural population aging in China.
Table 1 shows the selection and description of the variables of each system.

Table 1. Description of influencing variables on RPA.
Variable Systems Variables (Abbreviation) Descriptions
Natural and mechanical demographic
characteristics
Total population (TPOP) The total population in each county
The proportion of 55 to 64 years old
(P55-64) ten years ago P55-64 represents the base of aged people
Fertility rate (FER) The proportion of births in the total
population
Longevity rate (LGV) The proportion of the population aged 80
and above in the total population
Migration rate (MIG)

Socioeconomic characteristics
Per capita GDP (PGDP) The per capita GDP of each county
Urbanization rate (UBZ) The proportion of nonagricultural Hukou
in total population
Healthcare accessibility characteristics
Number of hospitals (HOS) The number of hospitals in each county
Number of beds (BED) The number of beds in each county
Educational characteristics
Per capita years of education (PEDU)
Refers to the average years of education
of the population aged 6 and over. A
college degree or above is calculated as
16 years, 12 years for high school, 9 years
for junior high school, 6 years for primary
school, and 0 years for illiteracy
Illiteracy rate (ILT) The proportion of illiterate people aged
15 and over in the total population
Hukou1 means the household registration system in China, which includes nonagricultural Hukou and agricultural
Hukou.
In terms of the demographic characteristics, we selected the total population (TPOP)
of each county, proportion of the population aged 55–64 (P55-64) ten years ago, fertility
rate (FER), longevity rate (LGV), and migration rate (MIG) to characterize the natural
and mechanical population change. The TPOP reflects the population size of an area.
The P55-64 in each county in 1990, 2000, and 2010 refers to the population base of the
elderly. The higher the P55-64, the greater the impact on population aging changes after
10 years [12]. The FER refers to the proportion of the new generation population, which
is considered one of the mechanisms underlying demographic change [13]. The trend of
low fertility rates and a reduction in the size of the birth population will further exacerbate
population aging. The LGV is the proportion of people aged 80 and over in the total, as
people over 80 are regarded as having longevity, referring to the classification of the World
Health Organization of the United Nations [14]. One of the best achievements of modern
civilization has been the enormous reduction in human mortality [15], and the significant
prolongation in life expectancy has had a significant impact on aging.
The urbanization rate (UBZ) refers to the proportion of the nonagricultural registered
population in the total population, and the per capita GDP (PGDP) reflects the economic
development of a region. Both the UBZ and PGDP have an impact on migration patterns.
China implements a dual household registration system; nonagricultural-registered residents
enjoy better medical, education, employment, and housing conditions, whereas rural
residents do not receive the same benefits [16]. This system promotes the migration of
young laborers from rural to urban areas and accelerates urbanization to a great extent [17].
People often leave the countryside to pursue better economic benefits and go to cities with
more developed economies and better infrastructure for employment and life. Generally,
immigrant parents have relatively low mobility and do not tend to move with their children,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 5 of 18
which has led to issues with “empty-hearted villages” and “empty nest household” in
rural China.
As for the healthcare variables, the number of hospitals (HOS) and beds (BED) reflects
the status of the healthcare infrastructure. The improvement of medical and health
conditions can prolong life expectancy, thus indirectly affecting the population aging.
The per capita years of education (PEDU) and illiteracy rate (ILT) are two indicators
that reflect the educational status from different perspectives. The PEDU is an intensity
indicator that reflects the overall level of education, whereas the ILT is a structural indicator
that indicates the popularization of education. With the improvement in education levels
in China, the return on investment in education has increased, which causes families to pay
more attention to the quality of education rather than birth. Women’s intentions to have
children are indirectly influenced by the PEDU and ILT, and the proportion of older people
increases as the number of births declines.
2.4. Data Sources and Arrangement
The RPA, TPOP, and P55-64 data are from the fifth to seventh China population
censuses in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively [18–20]. As some of the counties have not
publish the seventh national census data yet, we used the prefecture-level data instead. A
population census in China is conducted every ten years. The relevant departments in all
regions conduct a comprehensive survey and registration of the existing population of the
country on a general, household-by-person basis in strict accordance with the instructions
and laws. The focus of the census is to master, analyze, and predict the development and
changes of the existing population in various places, mainly to understand the sex ratio, sex
ratio at birth, single and married populations, elderly population, etc. The annual data of
the fertility rate (FER), longevity rate (LGV), migration rate (MIG), urbanization rate (UBZ),
per capita GDP (PGDP), per capita education (PEDU), illiteracy rate (ILT), and the number
of hospitals (HOS) and beds (BED) can be collected in the Statistic Yearbook published by
the National Bureau of Statistics of China [3].
3. Methods
In this study, we focused on examining the spatial distribution and evolution patterns
and revealing the influential factors of RPA. First, we utilized the Getis–Ord Gi* method to
analyze the spatial distribution patterns of rural population aging. Then, from a dynamic
perspective, the standard deviational ellipse method was applied to analyze the change
in the distribution range and the trajectory of gravity. Finally, we analyzed the potential
driving factors of the spatial patterns from demographic, socioeconomic, healthcare, and
educational perspectives using the Geographical Detector method.
3.1. Getis–Ord Gi*
The Getis–Ord Gi* (pronounced G-i-star) method, originally developed by Getis and
Ord [21], is used to identify a tendency for positive spatial clustering and can distinguish
high and low spatial associations between the locations [22]. In this study, Getis–Ord Gi*
was used to detect the high and low value clustering areas of RPA. A simple form of Gi*
statistics is:
Gi
 =
ånj
=1Wijxj
ånj
xj
(1)
where the Gi* statistic describes the spatial dependency of incident i over all n events, Wij
is the spatial weight between feature i and j, xj is the attribute value of feature j, n is the
total number of features, and X is calculated as:
X =
ånj
=1 xj
n
(2)
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 6 of 18
The Gi
 statistic is expressed in the form of a statistically significant z-score. When
the z-score is high, the clustering of the high value will be intense. The resultant z-score
indicates whether features with high or low values cluster geographically. A z-score near
zero indicates no apparent spatial clustering. This tool works by examining each feature
within the context of neighboring features. Getis–Ord Gi* identifies significant spatial
clusters of high (hot spots) and low values (cold spots).
3.2. Standard Deviational Ellipse
The standard deviational ellipse (SDE), introduced by sociologist Welty Lefever in
1926 [23], is one of the most classical and popular methods to analyze the directional
characteristics of spatial distribution [24]. This model creates ellipses or ellipsoids to
summarize the spatial characteristics of geographic features, including central tendency,
dispersion, and directional trends. It is convinced that an ellipse can geographically
represent spatial data in a highly effective way [25]. The spatial–temporal evolution of
seasonal tornado activity [26], the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic [27], population
distribution [28], and other topics are investigated using the SDE method. The calculation
of the SDE includes the center coordinates, azimuth q, long axis, and short axis. Among
them, the center coordinates represent the center of gravity of the space elements. The
azimuth q, which can be defined as the direction of the long axis, determines the orientation
of an ellipse [25], whereas the long and short axes determine the shape, indicating the
distribution density of a set of geographical units in one- and two-dimensional spaces,
respectively [29].
To create the SDE, the initial step is to take the mean of the x and y coordinates
of all of the n units studied to calculate the center coordinates [24]. Then, calculate the
azimuth q. Finally, referring to the calculation formulas of various parameters mentioned
in the literature of Lefever, Gong, Yuill, and Xia [23–25,29], the formulas are as follows:
Step 1: Calculation of center coordinate of the ellipse:
SDEx =

where {( xi, yi); i = 1, 2, . . . . . . , ng are the coordinates of the geographical units studied.
SDEx and SDEy are the x, y coordinates of the mean center. The mean center coordinates,
as the center of the geographical elements, reflect the relative position of rural population
aging in a two-dimensional space in this study.
Step 2: Calculate the direction (azimuth q) of the ellipse:

In this research, the SDE method was employed to reveal the dynamic changes and
spatial evolution of rural aging in China. We used the SDE tool provided by ArcGIS
software (Version 10.3, Redlands, CA, USA) to conduct the analysis on the spatial–temporal
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 7 of 18
analysis of population aging in China. The center coordinates reflect the center of gravity
of the population aging in counties as well as in rural areas in China. The long axis reflects
the main trend of rural aging in one- and two-dimensional space. The short axis, vertical to
the long axis, represents the distribution range of rural population aging. The larger the
difference between the values of the long and short axes, the more obvious the direction of
rural aging. The shorter the short axis is, the stronger the centripetal force is. The azimuth
is the rotation angle between the long axis and the north direction clockwise and indicates
the distribution direction of each county in China.
3.3. Geographical Detector: Influence Factor Analysis of Rural Population Aging
In this research, we used the model to detect the spatial stratified heterogeneity, which
is one basic characteristic of geographic phenomena. To explore the determinant power and
interactive impact of related factors on rural population aging, the Geographical Detector
(Geodetector, GD) model was employed in this study.
The GD model, originally proposed by Wang and Hu, serves as an effective spatial
statistics method based on the spatial variation analysis of the geographical strata of
variables [30,31]. The GD model has been extensively used to identify the driving factors in
a variety of fields, such as public health, environmental pollution, land use, urban livability,
and population distribution [32–35]. The GD model includes four detector modules: factor,
interaction, ecological, and risk. The mathematical expressions are as follows:
(1) The factor detector quantifies the influences of factors on the q-statistics. In this study,
the factor detector identifies which factors are responsible for the RPA. Its formula is:
q = 1 􀀀
åL
h=1 Nhsh
2
Ns
2 = 1 􀀀
SSW
SST
(7)
where q is the explanatory power of the determinants associated with the RPA.
f h = 1, . . . , Lg are the stratification of y or factor x, i.e., classification or partition;
Nh and N represent the number of units in h and the whole region, respectively.
sh
2 and s2 are the variance of units in h and the global variance of y over the whole
region, respectively. SSW indicates the sum of squares, whereas SST represents the
total sum of squares. The q-statistics range from 0 to 1; the larger the q-statistics are,
the stronger the influence of factor is.
(2) The interaction detector examines whether two independent variables, when taken
together, weaken or enhance each another or whether they are independent in developing
dependent variables [36]. In this study, the interaction detector examines
whether the factors (x1 and x2) have an interactive effect on RPA. First, the q-statistics
of factors x1 and x2, in respect of the RPA, were calculated and marked as q(x1)
and q(x2). Then, the interactive q-statistics of factors x1 and x2 were calculated and
marked as q(x1 \ x2). The interactive relationship can be classified into five types by
comparing the interactive q-statistics of the two factors and the q-statistics of each of
the two factors [37]. The five types are described in Table 2.
(3) The ecological detector, which is determined by the F-statistics, is used to compare
whether the impacts of the two factors (x1 and x2) on the dependent variable have a
significant difference [38]:
F =
Nx1 (Nx2 􀀀 1)SSWx1
Nx2 (Nx1 􀀀 1)SSWx2
(8)
SSWx1 = åL1
h=1 Nhsh
2, SSWx2 = åL2
h=2 Nhsh
2 (9)
where Nx1 and Nx2 mean the sample number of factors x1 and x2, respectively. SSWx1
and SSWx2 , respectively, denote the sum of the within-strata variances formed by x1
and x2. L1 and L2 represent the number of stratifications of factors x1 and x2, respectively.
If the null hypothesis H0: SSWx1 = SSWx2 is rejected at the confidence level a
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 8 of 18
(usually 5%), the influences of x1 and x2 on the dependent variable are statistically
significant. That is to say, the effect of factor x1 on RPA is significantly different from
that of factor x2 [39].
(4) The risk detector is used to detect whether the spatial–temporal pattern of RPA is
remarkably different, whereas the area studied is stratified by a variety of factors. If the
result of the two factors is “Y”, it means there are significant differences between the
two factors that influence RPA, whereas if the result of the two factors is “N”, it means
there is no significant difference. The risk detection is examined using t-statistics:
t =
Yh=1 􀀀Yh=2 h
Var(Yh=1)
nh=1 + Var(Yh=2)
nh=2
i1/2 (10)
where Yh denotes the average of Y in the subregion h, nh represents the size of samples
in the subregion h, and Var is variance.

4. Results
4.1. Spatial Distributions of Rural Aging in China
As mentioned in Section 2.2, the RPA (the percentage of rural population aged 65
and over) was utilized in this study as a measure of rural population aging. To better
compare the differences in RPA across regions in China, RPA was divided into three classes:
young type if the RPA is below 7%, aged type if the RPA is between 7% and 14%, and
hyper-aged type if the RPA is above 14%. Referring to this classification, a map of the
spatial distribution profiles of China’s rural population aging ratio from 2000 to 2020 was
drawn (see Figure 2a–c).
In 2000, the rural population aging in China was dominated by the young and aged
types. Notably, 53.2% of the units were of the young type and were widely distributed
across 31 provinces in China. Except for Tibet, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, 46.62% of the units
in 28 provinces were of the aged type. In addition, more than 50% of units were the aged
type in 14 provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Chongqing, Shandong, Beijing,
Shanghai, Liaoning, Guangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Tianjin, Sichuan, and Hubei Province.
Furthermore, there were 0.18% of the hyper-aged type units located in Shanghai, Tianjin,
and Liaoning Province.
In 2010, 79.4% of the units belonged to the aged type, covering 31 provinces, almost
the entire of China. Among them, the aged type units in 27 provinces, except for Xinjiang,
Tibet, and Qinghai, had reached more than 50%. There were 1% of units in Inner Mongolia,
Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Chongqing, and Sichuan
Province that were the hyper-aged type.
In 2020, the aged and hyper-aged types were the predominant age structure types in
China. The units of the aged type declined to 47.8%, whereas the hyper-aged type increased
to 46.9%. The majority of the places in the northwest, northern, southern, and Yunnan and
Guizhou Provinces in the southwest of China were the aged type. The northeast, eastern,
central, and Chongqing and Sichuan in the southwest were mainly the hyper-aged type.
Among them, more than 90% of the units in the northeast Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning
Provinces were the hyper-aged type. The eastern rural areas were more advanced in their
aging than the western rural areas. The units of young type declined to 5.3% and mainly
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 9 of 18
concentrated in Tibet, Qinghai. This type was also sporadically distributed in southern
Guangdong, eastern Fujian, central Ningxia, and western Sichuan.
Figure 2. Spatial distribution profiles of China’s rural population aging ratio in 2000 (a), 2010 (b), and
2020 (c).
Overall, rural population aging increased annually, and the regional disparity was
significant. In comparison with 2000, the transition from the young type to the aged type
was the most significant indication of how the RPA had risen to varied degrees and the age
structure of the population had switched to the type with a higher aging rate. Furthermore,
the range of the hyper-aged type of areas had been expanded.

4.2. Hot Spots Analysis of Rural Population Aging
The hot and cold spot analysis was performed to delineate the spatial cluster of rural
population aging in China based on Getis–Ord Gi* statistics. The resultant z-score identified
the states with high or low values of clustering spatially, as depicted in Figure 3a–c.
Figure 3. Spatial clustering (hot and cold spots) analysis of China’s rural population aging in 2000
(a), 2010 (b), and 2020 (c).
In 2000, significant hot spots (high cluster) of RPA were spread around the Shandong,
Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Provinces in the eastern area, and there were small hot
spots in: Fujian in the eastern area; Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan in the southern area;
Henan and Hubei in the central area; and Sichuan and Chongqing in Southwest China.
Significant cold spots (low cluster) were mostly spread across Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai
in the northeast area, Inner Mongolia in the northern area, Tibet in the southwest, and the
Pearl River Delta agglomeration of southern Guangdong in Southern China.

The map for 2010 showed cold spots in Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and
the Pearl River Delta agglomeration in Southern Guangdong. Compared with 2000, cold
spots in Tibet apparently expanded on a southern direction. Most of the hot spots were
found in Chongqing and east of Sichuan in the southwest area, and Shandong, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang in the eastern area, and Hunan in Central China. Some hot spots were also
portrayed on the northeast of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang.
In 2020, the cold and hot spots were clearly divided into two sides, and the cold spots
were biased toward the west, whereas the hot spots were biased toward the east of China.
Notably, the cold spots in Inner Mongolia transitioned to hot spots, and the hot spots in
Liaoning were enhanced. There was a slight decrease in the hot spots of RPA in Southern
and Eastern China. The RPA distribution formed a significant low cluster pattern in Tibet,
the west of Sichuan, and Qinghai meaning that it showed a low value. The low value is
due to the harsh natural conditions and the complex and diverse climate terrain, making it
a low value area for population density in China.
During the study period, the result of the analysis in China showed clear spatial
patterns of RPAthat the cold spots had significantly changed, mainly shown in the transition
from being dispersed around the northwest to concentrated in Tibet and Qinghai. In
addition, the RPA distribution formed hot spots that were increased in Chongqing and
Sichuan in the southwest, Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning in the northeast of China.
4.3. Analysis of Directional Evolution of the RPA
In this section, the SDE (standard deviational ellipse) was utilized to analyze changes
in the spatial evolution of RPA in China from 2000 to 2020. The SDE spatial evolution
distribution of RPA is shown in Figure 4, and the variation of parameters is listed in Table 3.
We also cited the Hu Line to analyze the changing characteristics of the center of gravity
of the RPA. The Hu Line, starting at Heihe city in Heilongjiang province and ending with
Tengchong city in Yunnan province, was consistent with the law of population distribution
in China. The Hu Line is a line of comparison, proposed by the Chinese geographer Hu
Huanyong in 1935, to divide China’s population density. In Hu’s opinion, on the southeast
side of the Hu Line, 36% of the land area supports 96% of the population, whereas on the
northwest side of the Hu Line, 64% of the land area accounts for about 4% of the population.

2020 33.59E 113.19E 63.6 12,839.65 8140.22
The area of the SDEs represents the concentration of RPA. During the study period,
five-sixths of the ellipse area is to the southeast of the Hu Line because 96% of China’s
population is in the southeast half of the Hu Line. The ellipse accounted for about one-third
of China’s total land area, covering 26 provinces except Xinjiang, Tibet, Heilongjiang, Jilin,
and Hainan, indicating that rural population aging was widely distributed (or dispersed)
in China over time.
The mean centers of the SDEs captured the annual shifts in RPA. The mean centers
formed in Henan Province, Central China, as they developed from the southeast to the
northeast. However, this did not indicate that the rural population in Henan Province
was the most severe. This was due to the fact that, in 2000, the RPA in the southern
and eastern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Shanghai was
higher than other areas. However, in 2020, the RPA in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning in
Northeast China showed a high cluster, with more than 90% of the county administrative
units being hyper-aged.
The azimuth (tanq/) represents the orientation of the long axis of the SDEs, about
which RPA concentrates. The azimuth varied between 32 and 34 from 2000 to 2020,
although not significantly, indicating that RPA tends to orient around a northeast-tosouthwest
major axis. The short axis decreased, whereas the long axis increased, implying
the aging population’s more pronounced directional characteristics.
Combined, these changes illustrate that rural population aging is increasing and
becoming more concentrated toward the southwest and northeast of China, particularly
to Chongqing and Sichuan in the southwest, and Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning in the
northeast. This is contrary to the internal migration pattern that flows from north to south,
indicating that although a multitude of workers from rural areas migrated from north to
south, their parents (as well as their children) were still left behind in their hometowns,
creating the so-called “empty hearted village” phenomenon.
4.4. The Driving Forces of RPA on Geographical Detector
There is significant regional variability in the population aging in rural China, according
to the analysis of the hot spots and the directional distribution of RPA. This section
discusses the findings of the GD (Geographical Detector) model in order to identify the main
influencing factors of spatial and temporal differences in population aging in rural China.
4.4.1. The Analysis of Factor Detector on RPA
To clarify the similarities and differences among the aging mechanisms in different
regions of China, the factor detector calculated the q-values to represent the relative
importance of potential factors in RPA (Table 4).
The proportion of people aged 55 to 64 (P55-64) and the longevity rate (LGV) were
high q-statistics, indicating these two factors were the most important factors affecting rural
aging in China. The initial aging level was the most important factor controlling the aging
of the rural population in China, and the longevity of the elderly critically impacts rural
aging. However, some aspects of healthcare and socioeconomics, such as the number of
hospitals (HOS), number of beds (BED), and the per capita GDP (PGDP), showed low
q-statistics. This was due to the fact that HOS and BED cannot reflect the medical staff’s
diagnosis, treatment skills, and service attitudes towards patients. In addition, with the
background of increasing aging in China, except for some of the most developed areas,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 13 of 18
particularly the Pearl River Delta agglomeration in the southern Guangdong Province, the
PGDP plays a relatively unimportant role in rural population aging.

ILT 0.028 0.124 0.205 0.242 0.094 0.089 0.388
For different areas, the decisive factors were different. In Central, Eastern, Northeast,
and Northwest China, the fertility rate (FER) showed a relatively strong determinant. One
of the major demographic factors contributing to population aging is declining fertility.
In Northeast China, the urbanization rate (UBZ), per capita years of education (PEDU),
fertility rate (FER), longevity rate (LGV), and migration rate (MIG) were strong driving
factors. Since the industrialization of the northeast began early, most of the agricultural
population has shifted to the industrialized urban population. The higher the education
level, the stronger the awareness of healthcare and the stronger the ability to be healthy. The
northeast region is a historically multiethnic and culturally integrated region. Immigrant
waves such as the “Rush to the Northeast” have greatly enriched the population gene pool
of the northeast region and further increased the heterogeneity of the health status of the
elderly population in the region. Rural areas in Northwest and Northern China are aging
primarily as the result of demographic changes. In Southern China, the total population
(TPOP) played a more significant role. As the most populous province, Guangdong has
plenty of young and middle-aged migrant workers, making the problem of population
aging less severe. Furthermore, the not-aged population moving into the city has a “diluting
effect” on the aging of the population, and the aggregation and diffusion effects caused by
different stages of city development are important for both aging migration.
4.4.2. The Analysis of Interaction Detector on RPA
In total, 55 pairs of interactions were calculated between 11 variables using the interaction
detector. Table 5 shows that the interaction relationships among all the demographic,
socioeconomic, healthcare, and educational factors. The q statistics in the table represent
the explanatory power of the two factors acting together on the RPA. The synergistic effects
between each pair of driving factors were manifested as bivariate- enhanced or nonlinearenhanced
influences on RPA in this study. This indicates that the interaction between the
two driving factors had a stronger influence than each individual factor on the RPA. Among
the interactions of all factors, the longevity rate (LGV), intersected with the other indicators,
yielded the strongest value, with all reaching 0.72 or more, indicating that the longevity
rate (LGV) was the most predominant factor affecting the RPA. The q (LGV \ P55  64)
was the maximum (0.82), indicating that the interaction between longevity rate and
P55-64 was the strongest. In addition, among the interactions of the socioeconomic factors,
q ( TPOP \ P55  64) was the maximum (0.61).

4.4.3. Statistical Significance of Differences among Driving Factors
The significance of varying influence among the 11 factors was examined via the
ecological detector and risk detector. Table 5 shows that upward of half were statistically
significant, whereas statistically significant differences existed between the urbanization
rate (UBZ) and the fertility rate (FER), the numbers of beds (BED) and the total population
(TPOP), the per capita years of education (PEDU) and total population (TPOP), and the
numbers of bed (BED) and per capita years of education (PEDU). Combining the results of
the factor detector, it can be concluded that the fertility rate (FER) had a greater impact on
RPA compared to urbanization (UBZ); and the influence of per capita years of education
(PEDU) on RPA was significantly stronger than that of the number of beds (BED).
5. Discussions
In this paper, we focused on analyzing the spatial temporal patterns and potential
influence factors of rural population aging in China from 2000 to 2020. The results revealed
that the population aging in rural China is characterized by significant spatial
heterogeneity. First, we analyzed the hot (high cluster) and cold spots of rural population
aging by Getis-Ord Gi*. The analysis found that three major hot spots were formed in
the northeast (northeast of Inner Mongolia and Liaoning), eastern (Zhejiang and Jiangsu),
and southwest area (Chongqing and Sichuan), whereas cold spot clusters were formed
in Tibet, Qinghai, the southern Guangdong, and the western Sichuan Province. Second,
the standard deviational ellipse was utilized to analyze the spatial directional evolution of
rural population aging. It was discovered that the aging of rural population tends to orient
around a northeast-to-southwest major axis, implying that the southwest and northeast face
more challenges regarding aging. Finally, the potential influence factors of rural population
aging in China were detected. The longevity rate, fertility rate, and proportion of aged
55 to 64 years old are predominant factors of rural population aging in China.
The results of this study need to be considered in combination with those from
other recent studies that provide spatiality and the driving forces of population aging
in China [5,6,8,40]. Our results preliminarily summarized the characteristics of different
types of aging and highlighted changes in the spatiality of rural population aging, generally
presenting a southwest-to-northeast evolution pattern. In addition, we concluded that the
predominant influence factors of rural population aging in China are mainly caused by the
natural changes in population age structure, and socioeconomic factors are the important
reasons for the differences in rural population aging in different regions. The findings
indicate that population aging is not only a spatial–temporal process but also a natural
population structure change process.
There are some deficiencies in this study to be discussed. First, the county-level analysis
units are rather large to measure accurately the population aging in towns and villages.
Although the county-level panel data used in this study reflected the spatial–temporal
distribution and evolutionary patterns of China’s rural population aging from a macroscopic
perspective, the distribution of older populations in a county from a microscopic
perspective cannot easily be reflected. Even so, due to the availability of data, 2846 counties
in 31 provinces on mainland China were still used as the unit of analysis. Second, the
selection and discussion of variables influencing the spatial and temporal patterns are
insufficiently exhaustive. Noneconomic factors such as natural environmental conditions,
diet structures, and personalities should be further discussed. Third, there is also limited
demonstration regarding how the aging of the rural population differs in different regions.
Take Shenzhen and Dongguan cities in Guangdong Province, for example. Due to the
highly developed socioeconomics, relatively open household registration system, and
many employment opportunities, young laborers continuously immigrate and earn a living
there, making them two of the youngest cities in Guangdong Province and even in China.
Therefore, future research should concentrate on the heterogeneous factors influencing
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15631 16 of 18
rural population aging at a local level to provide a reference for the development of more
specific solutions to the rural aging problem.
6. Conclusions
The study results revealed the spatial-temporal distribution and predominant factors
of population aging in rural China from 2000 to 2020, and found obvious differences in the
aging patterns within each regions. Consequently, it is necessary for the Chinese Government
to make scientific and precise policy decisions with full consideration of the spatial
variation. First, retirement resources and preferential policies should be appropriately tilted.
For example, according to the needs of rural areas, a number of nursing homes should be
planned and built in places close to township health centers to provide centralized care for
the disabled and elderly. Moreover, well-being for migrant workers in rural areas needs
to be elevated to ensure that they have the same level of social welfare as urban residents.
Health-related infrastructures, such as hospitals, care centers, and nursery centers need
to be constructed, especially in the less developed northern areas of China, to improve
the accessibility of the aged to healthcare. As the number of rural nuclear families and
empty nesters living alone increases, the ability of families to age in place diminishes,
causing the tradition of relying on children to age in place to change [41]. Therefore, in
the future, there will be an urgent need to introduce social capital, i.e., government and
enterprise cooperation in providing social elderly care services, to solve part of the rural
elderly care problem. Government subsidies and tax breaks can be used to encourage
social forces to set up private institutions for the elderly. In addition, the private sector
should provide services that enrich learning, recreation, and leisure activities for the rural
elderly. Furthermore, private senior care institutions should also focus on strengthening
their branding and determining a business model that fits their needs, taking into account
the elderly consumer, relevant government policies and measures, and their own business
philosophy to adopt a series of suitable business methods.
