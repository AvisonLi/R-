Collagen alpha-1(III) chain, also known as the alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, is a protein that in humans is
encoded by the COL3A1 gene. Three alpha 1 chains are required to form the type III collagen molecule which has
a long triple-helical domain. Type III collagen, an extracellular matrix protein, is synthesized by cells as a preprocollagen.
It is found as a major structural component in hollow organs such as large blood vessels, uterus and
bowel. Other functions of type III collagen include interaction with platelets in the blood clotting cascade and it
is also an important signaling molecule in wound healing. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene cause the vascular type
of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS; OMIM 130050). It is the most serious form of EDS, since patients often die
suddenly due to a rupture of large arteries. Inactivation of the murine Col3a1 gene leads to a shorter life span in
homozygous mutant mice. The mice die prematurely from a rupture of major arteries mimicking the human
vEDS phenotype. The biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations have been studied extensively. Most
of the glycine mutations lead to the synthesis of type III collagen with reduced thermal stability, which is more
susceptible for proteinases. Intracellular accumulation of this normally secreted protein is also found.
Ultrastructural analyses have demonstrated dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and changes in the diameter of
collagen fibers. Other clinical conditions associated with type III collagen are several types of fibroses in which
increased amounts of type III collagen accumulate in the target organs.

1. Introduction
Type III collagen, first identified and described in 1971 (Miller et al.,
1971), is an important structural protein, classified as one of the major
fibrillar collagens (Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995). It constitutes about
5–20% of the entire collagen content in the human body (Miller, 1988).
Its essential role in the structural integrity of arteries, uterus and bowel
has been clearly demonstrated by studies on patients who harbour
mutations in the COL3A1 gene (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]; Byers
et al., 2017; Malfait et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). The cardinal clinical
manifestations of these patients include spontaneous, life-threatening
arterial, uterine and bowel ruptures (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]; Byers
et al., 2017; Malfait et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). Other clinical phenotypes
associated with COL3A1 missense and nonsense mutations include
severe brain anomalies suggesting that COL3A1 is essential for
the normal brain development.
This review summarizes the information on the human (COL3A1)
and mouse (Col3a1) gene, transcripts and protein, and discusses the
disease phenotypes associated with type III collagen mutations and
altered protein levels, as well as mouse models. Table 1 lists the characteristics
of the human (COL3A1) and mouse (Col3a1) gene, transcripts
and protein, and provides links to available resources.
2. Chromosomal location and intron-exon organization of
COL3A1 and Col3a1
In the human genome, COL3A1 encoding the α1 chain of type III
collagen is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 [2q32.2; genomic
coordinates (GRCh38): Chr2:188,974,320-189,012,746]. The gene is
approximately 38 kb long and has 51 exons, which are numbered 1–52
to match the numbering of exons in the genes for other fibrillar collagens
(Fig. 1) (Valkkila et al., 2001). The sizes of the exons vary from
45 nt (exons 13, 15, 18 and 30) to 1105 (exon 52) (Valkkila et al.,
2001). All exons except exon 2 begin with a complete codon, and all
exons encoding the triple-helical domain start with a codon for a glycine
(Valkkila et al., 2001). The first intron at approximately 11.5 kb is
the largest one in the COL3A1 gene, whereas the second largest intron is
1500 bp and the smallest intron is only 85 bp.
COL3A1 gene is in tail-to-tail orientation with a gene for another
fibrillar collagen, namely COL5A2 (Valkkila et al., 2001). The sequence
between these two genes is about 22 kb and it contains several repeat
sequences including a LINE-1, two AT, and an Alu repeat (Valkkila

et al., 2001). A phylogenetic analysis for the human COL3A1 and
COL5A2 genes based on the sequences of the carboxy (C)-terminal
domains indicated that these two genes likely evolved from a common
ancestor (Valkkila et al., 2001).
Genetic variation present in the COL3A1 gene has been compared
between four ethnic groups, namely African American, European,
Mexican and Chinese (Chan et al., 2008). DNA samples from 48 unrelated
individuals from each of these four groups were analysed for all
the exonic and some intronic regions of four collagen genes (COL1A1,
COL1A21, COL2A1 and COL3A1). A total of 114 polymorphic sites were
identified in COL3A1, only four (Ala679Thr, Thr698Ala, Val1205Ile,
and Gln1353His) of which led to an amino acid change. Phylogenetic
trees generated using these results demonstrated that the African
American group was evolutionary separated from the other three
groups when COL3A1 sequences were analysed.
Two transcripts, 4.8 kb and 5.5 kb are generated from the COL3A1
gene using different polyadenylation sites (Fig. 2) (Ala-Kokko et al.,
1989).
In the mouse genome, Col3a1 encoding the mouse α1 chain of type
III collagen is located on the chromosome 1 [genomic coordinates
(GRCm38): Chr1:45311538-45349706]. The gene is similar in size to
the human COL3A1 gene with a length of approximately 38 kb and 51
exons. The exon-intron organization is also identical to that of the
human COL3A1 gene (Toman and de Crombrugghe, 1994; Valkkila
et al., 2001).
3. Protein structure
3.1. Biosynthesis of type III preprocollagen
Type III collagen is synthesized by cells as a pre-procollagen, which
undergoes multiple co- and posttranslational modifications (Fig. 3). The
signal peptide is cleaved off producing a procollagen molecule (Fig. 2).
Three identical type III procollagen chains come together in the Cterminal
ends, and the structure is stabilized by the formation of disulphide
bonds. Each individual chain folds into left-handed helix and
the three chains are then wrapped together into a right-handed superhelix,
the triple helix (Bachinger et al., 1980; Birk and Silver, 1984;
Boudko and Engel, 2004). Prior to assembling the super-helix, each
monomer is subjected to a number of post-translational modifications
that occur while the monomer is being translated. First, on the order of
145 prolyl residues of the 239 in the triple-helical domain are hydroxylated
to 4-hydroxyproline by prolyl-4-hydroxylase. Second, some of
the lysine residues are hydroxylated or glycosylated, and some lysine as
well as hydroxylysine residues undergo oxidative deamination catalysed
by lysyl oxidase. Other post-translational modifications occur
after the triple helix is formed. The large globular domains from both
ends of the molecule are removed by C- and amino(N)-terminal-proteinases
to generate triple-helical type III collagen monomers called
tropocollagen. In addition, crosslinks form between certain lysine and
hydroxylysine residues. In the extracellular space in tissues, type III
collagen monomers assemble into macromolecular fibrils, which aggregate
into fibers, providing a strong support structure for tissues requiring
tensile strength (Fig. 3).
There are two types of hydroxylations of proline residues, namely
the formation of 4-hydroxyproline and 3-hydroxyproline, by two different
enzymes (Weis et al., 2010). 4-hydroxyprolines are known to
stabilize the triple helix, whereas the exact function of 3-hydroxyproline
is not known, but it could be associated with inter-triple-helical
interactions and supramolecular assembly. Between one and six 3-hydroxyprolines
in each pro-α-chain are found in human fibrillar procollagens
I, II, V, and XI, but none in the human type III procollagen
although the chicken type III procollagen has one 3-hydroxyproline at
position 986 (Weis et al., 2010).
The C-propeptides are important in the biosynthesis of fibrillar
collagens by directing the chain selection, stabilizing the associated α
chains by the formation of interchain disulphide bonds, and facilitating
the formation of the triple helix (Boudko and Engel, 2004; Bourhis
et al., 2012; DiChiara et al., 2018). In type III procollagen, the C-propeptide
has eight cysteine residues and an N-glycosylation site. To facilitate
the functional analyses, a recombinant form of the C-propeptide
of type III collagen was expressed in a baculovirus system (Zafarullah
et al., 1997). It was secreted into the medium and was shown to contain
the expected inter- and intrachain disulphide bonds. In 2012, Bourhis
et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of the human C-propeptide
of type III procollagen (Bourhis et al., 2012). This study provided the
three-dimensional structure of the homotrimeric propeptide and has
facilitated the prediction of functional consequences of COL3A1 mutations
occurring in the C-propeptide.
Production of a full-length recombinant COL3A1 protein has been
hampered by the large number of posttranslational modifications required
in the biosynthesis of collagens (Tomita et al., 1995; Shi et al.,
2017). The most successful approach has been the use of a baculovirus
expression system (Tomita et al., 1995; Lamberg et al., 1996), which
yielded type III collagen molecules with stable triple helix, but their
melting temperature was lower than that from cultured skin fibroblasts
(Tomita et al., 1995). When the insect cells were co-transfected with
human prolyl-4-hydroxylase, the recombinant type III procollagen was
disulphide-bonded and the pepsin-digested collagen had a thermal
stability of 41 °C in a trypsin-chymotrypsin assay, a result comparable
to that for a native type III collagen (Lamberg et al., 1996). In subsequent
experiments using a yeast expression system, an intriguing
finding was that co-expression of type III procollagen together with
prolyl-4-hydroxylase, a key enzyme responsible for hydroxylating proline
residues during collagen biosynthesis, markedly increased the
amount of active prolyl-4-hydroxylase even though there was no
change in the mRNA levels (Vuorela et al., 1997). The authors concluded
that the increase in this activity was most likely due to an increased
association of enzyme subunits to form the active enzyme tetramer
and that in the absence of a collagen substrate the enzyme
subunits rapidly dissociated.
The crystal structure has been determined for a synthetic triplehelical
peptide with 42 amino acids (aa) that correspond to aa
991–1032 in the type III procollagen and contain the so called Cterminal
cysteine knot, the region with a disulphide bond (Boudko
et al., 2008). The analyses of the structure demonstrated that the
multiple non-imino acids in this peptide, are part of direct intra- and
interhelical contacts, and could interact with other extracellular matrix
components (Boudko et al., 2008).
3.2. Structure of type III preprocollagen, procollagen and collagen
The triple-helical conformation, which is a characteristic feature of
all fibrillar collagens, is possible because of the presence of a glycine as
every third amino acid in the sequence of about 1000 amino acids. This
(Gly-Xaa-Yaa)n sequence is repeated 343 times in the type III collagen
molecule. Proline or hydroxyproline is often found in the X- and Yposition
giving the triple helix stability (Figs. 2 and 4).
The exact amino acid sequence was first determined by partial
amino acid sequencing of bovine (Glanville and Fietzek, 1976; Fietzek
et al., 1979; Brandt et al., 1984) and human (Gilbert et al., 1978; Seyer
and Kang, 1981) type III collagen. Recombinant DNA technology then
made it possible to obtain complementary DNA (cDNA) clones from
chicken (Yamada et al., 1983), mouse (Wood et al., 1987), and human
(Loidl et al., 1984; Chu et al., 1985; Miskulin et al., 1986; Mankoo and
Dalgleish, 1988; Toman et al., 1988; Ala-Kokko et al., 1989; Janeczko
and Ramirez, 1989) samples to determine the nucleotide sequence of
the type III preprocollagen transcripts (Fig. 2). The cDNA and amino
acid sequences between human, mouse and bovine type III collagen are
very similar (Ala-Kokko et al., 1989).

those of other two major fibrillar collagen chains, the α1 and α2 chains

of type I procollagen, revealed that the triple-helical domain of the type
III procollagen is 15 amino acid longer (1029 aa) than the triple-helical
domains (1014 aa) of the two other α chains (Ala-Kokko et al., 1989).
There were also differences in the lengths of the other functional domains,
the largest difference being in the length of the N-propeptides,
which is only 57 aa in the α2 chain of type I procollagen, but 139 and
129 aa in the α1 chains of type I and type III procollagen, respectively
(Ala-Kokko et al., 1989). The codon usage for glycine, proline and
alanine in the triple-helical domain was similar between the type I and
type III collagen in that it favoured U as the third base (Ala-Kokko et al.,
1989).
4. Tissue distribution
Type III collagen is found as a major structural component in hollow
organs such as large blood vessels, uterus and bowel, tissues that must
withstand stretching. It is also found in many other tissues in association
with type I collagen. During the development of an embryo, type I
and III collagen seem to be expressed in a coordinated manner based on
a comprehensive survey of different developmental stages (E7.5 to
E17.5) of the mouse embryo using in situ RNA hybridization
(Niederreither et al., 1995). In another study that analysed COL3A1
mRNA levels in human fetal tissues, the expression patterns of COL1A1
and COL3A1 were quite different in the developing skeletal tissues and
the authors suggested that this might mean that they are under different
regulatory mechanisms (Sandberg et al., 1989).
Many early studies were not able to extract type III collagen from
bone, and concluded that bone did not contain type III collagen. The
first study to show that human bone does contain type III collagen was a
histological analysis by Keene et al. (1991) and used monoclonal antibodies.
Type III collagen-containing fibers were found in all samples
from donors between ages of 30 weeks to 80 years. Type III collagen

was detected throughout the cortex, but was concentrated at the Haversian
canal surface and the bone-periosteal interface.
A detailed mRNA expression analysis based on RNA-sequencing of
27 different human organs and tissues from 95 individuals was carried
out by Fagerberg et al. (2014). COL3A1 mRNA had a high level of expression
in the gall bladder, placenta, bladder and endometrium
(Fig. 5A). It was also detected in various parts of the gastrointestinal
track, fat, heart, prostate, skin, spleen and testis. Unfortunately the
sample collection did not contain blood vessels.
A similar analysis was carried out in the mouse using 69 samples
from different tissues and developmental stages (Yue et al., 2014). The
results showed that Col3a1 expression was high in the bladder, mammary
gland, placenta, fat and in the limbs of E14.5 mouse embryos
(Fig. 5B). Col3a1 mRNA was also detectable in the gastrointestinal
track, heart, kidney, lung, ovary, and mouse embryonic brain and liver,
but not in the adult mouse brain or liver.
Expression of type III collagen has also been studied in different
benign and malignant tumors using immunostaining (d'Ardenne et al.,
1984). All tumor samples were positive for type III collagen. Of the
benign tumors, leiomyomas, and giant cell tumors of tendon sheaths
had the highest level of type III collagen expression, whereas among the
malignant tumors, leiomyosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and sarcomas had
the highest expression.
5. Function
Type III collagen provides tensile strength and integrity for many
organs, but it has also been reported to have several other functions. In
tissues the diameter of type III collagen fibrils is smaller than that of
type I collagen (Birk and Silver, 1984). Type I and III collagens
sometimes appear in the same fibrils and in that situation type III collagen
regulates the fibril diameter (Fleischmajer et al., 1990; Cameron
et al., 2002). Type III collagen is also found in the adult human cartilage
and it has been suggested that its role is to act as a modifier of the fibril
network composed of type II collagen together with other minor collagens
during tissue healing (Wu et al., 2010). Type III collagen molecules
appear to be cross-linked to the surface of type II collagen fibrils.
Interestingly, most of the type III collagen molecules found to be present
in the cartilage were not fully processed (see Section 3) and contained
disulphide-bonded N-terminal propeptides.
One of the earliest studies on type III collagen in 1975 showed that
it influences the aggregation of human platelets (Balleisen et al., 1975).
Follow-up studies demonstrated that one peptide generated by a cyanogen
bromide treatment of calf skin type III collagen could facilitate
platelet adhesion in human blood (Fauvel et al., 1978). The peptide was
broken down further by chymotrypsin and hydroxylamine to narrow
down the amino acid residues responsible for this function. Further
evidence on the interaction between collagens and platelets was provided
by Balleisen et al. (1979), when they demonstrated that aggregation
of platelets could be inhibited by coating the collagen fibrils
with antibodies directed towards types I, II and III collagens thereby
preventing the direct physical contact between platelets and collagens.
Chiang et al. (1993) isolated a 47-kDa membrane protein from platelets
and showed that it interacted with type III collagen. It is now known
that platelets interact with type III collagen through specific glycoproteins
and non-integrin receptors (Monnet and Fauvel-Lafeve, 2000).
Jarvis et al. (2008) used 57 synthetic peptides, the sequence of which
was derived from the sequence of COL3A1 and which could form a
triple-helix, and tested their ability to interact with human and mouse

bind to glycoprotein VI in platelets.
Type III collagen also functions in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation
and differentiation through its interaction with integrins,
which are cell surface receptors (Kim et al., 2005). The sites present in
type III procollagen and showing high affinity to bind integrins are
located in the C-terminal region (Kim et al., 2005).
It is likely that future research will identify additional binding sites
in the type III collagen molecule for its interaction partners. This is
facilitated by the Collagen Toolkit designed by the investigators at
Cambridge University in the United Kingdom (https://collagentoolkit.
bio.cam.ac.uk/). The toolkit contains 57 overlapping peptides corresponding
to the triple-helical domain of type III collagen. The peptides
can be used in a 96-well format for mapping binding sites.
Based on measurements in the fluid collected from surgical wounds,
peritoneum and serum of patients who underwent surgical procedures,
the N-terminal propeptide levels of type III procollagen (PIIINP) increased
2–3 days after surgery (Haukipuro et al., 1987). At day 5 after
the surgery, the serum PIIINP levels were 1000-fold higher in surgical
patients than in non-surgical patients. These findings suggest that type
III collagen is required for wound healing.
6. Regulation of COL3A1 expression
Several lines of evidence suggest that COL3A1 expression is regulated
also on the posttranscriptional level. The biological pathways
involved in the regulation of COL3A1 expression include the transforming
growth factor (TGF) β1, Wnt/β-catenin, and the p38 mitogenactivated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These studies have important
implication for the developing new treatment strategies for fibrosis
in different organs (see Section 7.3).
Several studies have demonstrated that hypoxia alters type III collagen
expression. Duval et al. (2009) showed that hypoxia led to a
decrease in both mRNA and protein levels of COL3A1 in cultured
chondrocytes (Duval et al., 2009). A similar response was seen when
using transient expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF-1ɑ),
and the authors concluded that the effect is mediated by HIF-1ɑ. Zhang
et al. (2018) found an opposite result when using cultured rat pulmonary
microvascular endothelial cells under hypoxia (Zhang et al.,
2018). In this experimental system hypoxia led to an increase in Col3a1
mRNA levels.
Samokhin et al. (2018) studied the molecular interactions in human
pulmonary arterial hypertension using an in silico approach, and generated
a “fibrosome” consisting of protein-protein interactions important
for lung fibrosis (Samokhin et al., 2018). Next, they incorporated
into this network genes known to be regulated by
aldosterone. This in silico analysis resulted in identifying NEDD9 as the
key molecule in regulating gene expression that leads to pulmonary
fibrosis, vascular remodeling, and pulmonary hypertension. The authors
then went on to verify the findings experimentally and demonstrated
that hypoxia increased NEDD9 and COL3A1 expression in
human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and that this was independent
of TGFβ1 signaling. Nedd9-deficient mice exposed to hypoxia
had decreased amounts of Col3a1 and decreased systolic pressure
of the right ventricle. They concluded that NEDD9 targets COL3A1 to
promote endothelial fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension and
that oxidative modification of a cysteine residue in NEDD9 and paracrine
signaling of exosomes were the two mechanisms responsible for
this.
In response to hypoxia, injury or metabolic stress cells release
adenosine, a purine generated from ATP and ADP. Shaikh et al. (2016)
showed that in human skin fibroblasts adenosine acts through its receptors
and stimulates COL3A1 expression via the canonical and noncanonical
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Shaikh et al., 2016). Interestingly,
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was not involved in type I
collagen expression in this experimental system.
When investigating the potential mechanisms leading to chronic
allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model, Kilic et al. (2011)
discovered that a protein called the nerve growth factor induced the
expression of type III collagen (Kilic et al., 2011). A treatment of the
mice with an antibody against the nerve growth factor prevented this
induction. The nerve growth factor was shown to signal through the
MAPK pathway. Inhibition of this pathway in mouse lung fibroblasts
prevented induction of COL3A1 expression by the nerve growth factor.
Yamane et al. (2018) investigated the role of branched amino acids
leucine and isoleucine in the expression of Col1a1 and Col3a1 in the
skin of mice deficient in branched-chain ɑ-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase,
which inactivates the enzyme involved in catabolizing branched
amino acids (Yamane et al., 2018). Leucine and isoleucine levels were
low in these mice. Col1a1 and Col3a1 mRNA and protein levels were
also low compared to wild type mice. The authors found indirect evidence
that the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
was also decreased. Branched amino acids are known to signal via
mTOR.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF; also called FGF2) enhanced the expression of COL3A1 mRNA
and protein in human skin fibroblasts via MAPK signaling (Shen et al.,
2018). Using human amniotic fibroblast cultures and explants of amniotic
tissue, Mi et al. (2018) demonstrated that cortisol decreased
COL3A1 protein, but not mRNA levels (Mi et al., 2018). Further studies
revealed that the reduction in protein levels was likely due to degradation
mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Yuan et al.
(2018) treated cultured human skin fibroblasts with TGFβ1 and found
that the mRNA levels of COL3A1 were increased (Yuan et al., 2018).
A study by Chen et al. (2018) investigated the role of long noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs) in hypertrophic scars and found that one
lncRNA had lower levels (Chen et al., 2018). In cultured skin fibroblasts
overexpressing this same lncRNA reduced COL3A1 mRNA levels.
Thiele et al. (2004) identified two mRNA-binding proteins called
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1 and K that bind
to sequences in the 3′UTR of COL3A1 mRNA (Thiele et al., 2004). Their
experiments demonstrated that hnRNP K stabilized the COL3A1 mRNA,
which resulted in increased expression. They also showed that TGFβ1
activates the synthesis of these hnRNPs as well as the synthesis of type
III collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. Other studies have shown that the
response to TGFβ1 varies based on the embryological origin of the cells
(see Kuivaniemi et al., 2015); thus it is not possible to say if the regulatory
mechanisms are the same in other vascular beds.
7. Diseases associated with COL3A1 mutations and variants, or
altered levels of COL3A1 protein
Mutations in the COL3A1 gene cause the vascular type of Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome (vEDS; OMIM 130050), which is a rare, life-threatening
genetic disease. A few patients with arterial aneurysms without
clear signs of EDS have also been found to have COL3A1 mutations
(Kontusaari et al., 1990b). Other disease phenotypes associated with
COL3A1 include a brain abnormality characterized by frontoparietal
polymicrogyria, and many fibrotic diseases, in which increased
amounts of type III collagen are found in various organs.
7.1. COL3A1 defects in patients with vEDS and other forms of EDS
vEDS (OMIM130050; ICD-10: Q79.6), previously known as the arterial-
ecchymotic EDS, Sack-Barabas syndrome, EDSIV and EDS type 4,
is the most serious form of EDS, since patients often die suddenly due to
a rupture of large arteries or other hollow organs (Pope et al., 1977;
Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]; Pope et al., 1996; Pepin et al., 2014; Byers
et al., 2017; Malfait et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). Other clinical manifestations
of vEDS can include cigarette paper-like scarring of the skin,
large ecchymoses over bony protuberances due to bruising, skin so thin
that subcutaneous vessels are readily visible, joint laxity that is usually
confined to fingers, pneumothorax, acrogeria, talipes equinovarus,
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
158
keratoconus, gingival recession and fragility, and early-onset varicose
veins, but the clinical picture of vEDS can be quite heterogeneous even
among members of the same family (Pope et al., 1977; Pope et al.,
1996; Malfait et al., 2017). The median life expectancy is 50 years, and
most patients develop major complications before the age of 30 years.
Penetrance is 100% for mutations with autosomal dominant inheritance,
but shows age-dependence. Patients with heterozygous null
mutations usually have milder phenotype and these mutations have a
lower penetrance of approximately 50% (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
The inheritance mode of vEDS is autosomal dominant.
Approximately 50% of the vEDS patients have no family history of the
disease and the disease is due to de novo mutations (Byers, 1993 [updated
2019]). Prevalence estimate is 1–9/100,000, but it is likely that
many vEDS cases are undiagnosed. It is estimated that there are approximately
1500 vEDS cases in the USA (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Clinical diagnosis of vEDS is often difficult without genetic testing
for COL3A1 mutations. vEDS diagnosis should be suspected in individuals
with spontaneous ruptures of arteries, uterus or bowel at
young age and the diagnosis confirmed by DNA sequencing. Once a
mutation has been identified in the patient, testing for the at-risk relatives
should also be offered (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Clinical management of vEDS patients often requires a multidisciplinary
team of medical experts including primary care physicians,
genetic counsellors, human geneticists, radiologists, vascular surgeons,
general surgeons, gastroenterologists, and obstetricians. Evaluations
should include blood pressure monitoring, and arterial screening by
ultrasound, magnetic resonance or computed tomography imaging to
detect dissections and dilatations (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019];
Eagleton, 2016; Byers et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). Procedures such as
arteriograms, colonoscopies and elective surgeries should be avoided
due to tissue fragility, which could lead to complications. When surgical
treatment is needed, if feasible, it should be performed by surgeons
experienced in treating vEDS patients and familiar with the higher risks
associated with the care of these patients (Eagleton, 2016).
Only one clinical trial for a potential drug therapy to prevent vascular
events in vEDS patients has been published (Ong et al., 2010). In
this study, carried out in France and Belgium, celiprolol, a
cardioselective β-blocker with β2-agonist vasodilatation effects, was
used. Altogether 53 vEDS patients, 33 (62%) of whom were later confirmed
to have vEDS based on genetic testing, were randomly assigned
to treatment (n=25) or no treatment (n=28) groups. The trial was
ended early at 64 months due to the small number of patients available
for follow-up who had not developed any of the vascular events. Although
the authors concluded that celiprolol reduced the risk of arterial
complication, the study has been criticized for its small size, and the
fact that about third of the patients did not have COL3A1 mutations
(Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Female vEDS patients are at increased risk for pregnancy-related
complications based on a study on 616 pregnancies of 283 women with
confirmed COL3A1 defects (Murray et al., 2014) and should be followed
in a high-risk obstetric program (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]). In this
study, a total of 30 (4.9%) pregnancies resulted in the death of the
mother due to an arterial dissection or rupture, a uterine rupture, or
complications during a cesarean section. All of the deaths occurred in
women who had protein-altering COL3A1 mutations, whereas no
deaths were seen in the 51 pregnancies among the 27 women with
COL3A1 null mutations. The authors of this study also compared the
overall death rates of these women who had been pregnant to those
who had not, but had a genetically-confirmed vEDS diagnosis (n=243
nulliparous vEDS patients) and found that the overall survival rates
were similar in these two groups of women (Murray et al., 2014).
7.1.1. Protein analyses with skin fibroblasts taken from patients with vEDS
Before DNA analyses became feasible, skin biopsies were taken from
patients suspected of having vEDS and biochemical analyses were
carried out using cultured skin fibroblasts (Pope et al., 1975; Byers
et al., 1981; Stolle et al., 1985). These analyses involved culturing cells
in the presence of a radioactive proline, which was incorporated into
the newly synthesized collagens. It was then feasible to analyse the
secreted and intracellular proteins separately and assess intracellular
accumulation and secretion of collagens which have a high proline
content.
Additional analyses included “stress tests” in which the proteins
were subjected to a proteinase digestion at different temperatures
(Stolle et al., 1985; Tromp et al., 1989a; Tromp et al., 1989b;
Kontusaari et al., 1990b; Narcisi et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1997).
Properly folded type III procollagen can withstand a trypsin-chymotrypsin
treatment to 41 °C, but procollagen molecules containing mutations
will break down at lower temperatures due to unfolding of cooperative
blocks within the triple helix and expose the proteinase-sensitive
sites of the molecule. Another test was to carry out digestion with
collagenase, which cleaves normal type III procollagen at a very specific
site at aa 781 of the triple-helical domain (Fig. 6). The procollagen can
also be digested by pepsin, which will remove the globular propeptides,
the end result being collagen (Kontusaari et al., 1990b; Nuytinck et al.,
1992; Narcisi et al., 1993).
Increased amounts and intracellular accumulation of this normally
secreted protein are also often found (Anderson et al., 1997) in addition
to the synthesis of an overmodified type III collagen showing retarded
migration on a polyacrylamide gel (Nuytinck et al., 1992; Richards
et al., 1992; Narcisi et al., 1993). In some cases, the type III collagen
protein was digested with cyanogen bromide and the various peptides
analysed to map the defect (Nuytinck et al., 1992; Richards et al.,
1992).
7.1.2. DNA analyses and a mutation database for patients with vEDS
The first COL3A1 DNA study based on a preliminary Southern blot
analysis of a vEDS patient identified an approximately 3.3-kb deletion
in COL3A1 in 1988 (Superti-Furga et al., 1988). In a subsequent publication
three years later, DNA sequencing of the breakpoints of the
deletion demonstrated that it was much larger and included 16 exons
and approximately 7.5 kb of genomic DNA (Lee et al., 1991). Based on a
large number of studies that have screened for mutations in COL3A1 in
Fig. 6. Thermal unfolding of type III collagen from a patient with a Gly619Arg
mutation in COL3A1. Skin fibroblasts were obtained from the patient and a
control. The effect of a single base missense mutation was tested on the type III
collagen protein by using a proteinase assay. The type III collagen was first
digested with collagenase which cleaves the molecule at aa 781. This was then
followed by digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin. A large fraction of the
patient's type III collagen was digested to a fragment of approximately 620 aa at
temperatures 20-36 °C. In comparison the type III collagen isolated from control
fibroblasts stayed intact and did not break down until at 38 °C.

patients with vEDS, large deletions and insertions are not a common
type of mutations in these patients.
The first glycine mutation in the triple-helical domain was reported
in 1989 in a study that was also the first detailed DNA analysis of a
COL3A1 mutation using DNA sequencing both on the genomic and
cDNA level (Tromp et al., 1989a). This mutation changed a glycine at
aa position 790 to a serine (Gly790Ser; numbering from the beginning
of the triple-helical domain) (Tromp et al., 1989a).
A total of 63 COL3A1 mutations were summarized in a review article
published in 1997 (Kuivaniemi et al., 1997). About 20 years later,
over 650 different mutations have been reported, which are listed in a
COL3A1-specific database (see https://eds.gene.le.ac.uk/home.php?
select_db=COL3A1). In 2014, 410 different mutations were reported
from a single Medical Genetics Laboratory at the University of Washington,
USA (Pepin et al., 2014). Based on this study and the COL3A1
mutation database, the most common type of mutation is a missense
mutation substituting a bulkier amino acid for a glycine in the triplehelical
domain. The second most common type of mutations in vEDS
are COL3A1 RNA splicing mutations (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Schwarze
et al., 1997).
7.1.3. Mutations in the C-propeptide of COL3A1
Missense and nonsense mutations in the C-terminal propeptide of
type III procollagen possibly also cause vEDS, although the detailed
functional studies to prove this are still needed (Stembridge et al.,
2015). The C-propeptide is important for the assembly of the three pro-
α chains (Boudko and Engel, 2004; Bourhis et al., 2012), but knowledge
about the role of each aa in the sequence is limited and it is, therefore,
difficult to interpret the results. One of the patients in the study by
Stembridge et al. (Stembridge et al., 2015) was a female patient with a
Pro1440Leu mutation in the C-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen
(Stembridge et al., 2015). She had thin skin, easy bruisability,
mild joint laxity, periodontal disease with gum recession, and a typical
acrogeria, but no vascular or bowel ruptures by the age of 27 years. Her
father, who was mosaic for the same mutation, showed mild joint laxity
(see Section 7.1.5.). Cultured skin fibroblasts of the patient produced
less type III collagen than control fibroblasts. Protein modelling was
suggestive of leucine destabilizing the structure. Another patient was a
39-year old male with easy bruisability, hyperextensible skin, ruptured
ligament of the diaphragm, and bilateral inguinal hernia, but again no
vascular complications (Stembridge et al., 2015). Protein analysis of
cultured skin fibroblasts revealed type III collagen deficiency, and DNA
sequencing of genomic DNA revealed an Arg1432Leu missense mutation.
The patient's more mildly affected sister had the same mutation.
The third patient studied by Stembridge et al. (2015) was a 26-year old
female with a generalized joint laxity, easy bruisability, unusual facial
appearance, and a slightly enlarged pulmonary artery. DNA sequencing
found a nonsense mutation. Protein analyses demonstrated slightly reduced
amounts of type III procollagen. The fourth patient had skin and
joint manifestations, as well as a gastric paresis with atony, and was
diagnosed with the benign hypermobility or EDS type III. DNA sequencing
revealed a Lys1313Arg missense mutation, but based on
protein analyses performed on cultured skin fibroblasts the amount of
type III procollagen was normal. Protein modelling showed no adverse
consequences. The authors concluded the variant was a benign variant.
7.1.4. RNA splicing mutations in COL3A1
The most frequently seen pattern of abnormal splicing is exon
skipping, but other forms of aberrant splicing have also been detected
(Fig. 7) (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Schwarze et al., 1997). The normal
COL3A1 gene does not undergo alternative splicing. RNA splicing mutations
that lead to exon skipping, and thereby remove one entire exon,
produce a transcript that encodes a protein with multiple triplets of
amino acids deleted, since each exon in the triple-helical region starts
with a complete glycine codon. The resultant mutant protein is,
therefore, shorter by the number of amino acids encoded by that exon,
but the Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets stay in frame and there are no premature
termination codons.
In a study that described the first RNA splicing mutations in COL3A1
in 1990 (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990), three single nucleotide changes were
found, each mutating the first G in a different intron (introns 16, 20 and
42) to an A (Fig. 7). The patterns of RNA splicing were studied by S1
nuclease probe protection experiments and cDNA sequencing and were
found to differ (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Kontusaari et al., 1990a). The
intron 16 mutation led to an abnormal splicing that skipped exon 16,
whereas an identical mutation in intron 20 produced two different RNA
species, one of which was generated by an efficient use of a cryptic
splice and the other with no splicing of intron 20 and retaining the
entire intron in the resulting transcript. The third mutation located in
intron 42 led to an efficient use of a near-by cryptic splice site which
added only 30 nucleotides to the transcript and kept it in frame
(Kuivaniemi et al., 1990). The same intron 42 mutation was later found
in another unrelated patient and the splicing pattern was the same in
both patients (Schwarze et al., 1997). Interestingly, two different mutations
in the 5th nucleotide of intron 42 in two additional vEDS patients
also produced the same abnormal splicing (Giunta and
Steinmann, 2000; Okita et al., 2010) suggesting that the inclusion of 30
intronic nucleotides into the mRNA is an efficient form of splicing for
intron 42. Okita et al. (2010) showed that the mutation led to a decreased
amount of type III collagen synthesis by the patient's skin fibroblasts.
A single-base mutation in COL3A1 that changed the 5th nucleotide
of intron 37 from G to A led to abnormal RNA splicing, which produced
skipping of exon 37 (Wu et al., 1993). Quantification of the RNA splicing
patterns showed that 70% of the mutant allele was spliced through
exon skipping and 30% was spliced normally, when the skin fibroblasts
were grown at 37 °C. Interestingly, the amount of abnormal splicing
increased at a lower temperature and was approximately 90% at 31 °C.
Studies on RNA splicing defects in COL3A1 have led to a better
understanding of the mechanism of RNA splicing in large multi-exon
genes such as the collagen genes (Fig. 7). It is plausible to speculate that
the order of splicing of different introns varies and that the size of the
intron also influences the splicing pattern favoured when the normally
occurring splice site is mutated (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Schwarze
et al., 1997). Another factor likely to play a role is the presence of
cryptic splice sites, sequences near the normally used splice sites, which
are activated when the normal splice site becomes weaker through a
mutation (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990). The use of cryptic splice sites in an
intron leads to an incorporation of additional nucleotides into the
transcript (Fig. 7). These extra sequences usually contain premature
termination sites for translation and are detected by nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay, the result of which is the degradation of the abnormal
RNA molecules and no protein synthesis.
7.1.5. Germline and somatic cell mosaicism in the relatives of patients with
COL3A1 mutations
Germline and somatic cell mosaicism refers to a situation where a
mutation occurred during the embryogenesis of the individual and
therefore, the mutation is not present in all the cells of that individual.
Depending on the cell lineage in which the mutation occurred and the
number of cells with the mutation, the disease phenotype may or may
not manifest in that individual. It has been estimated that approximately
15% of the phenotypically normal parents of vEDS patients are
mosaic (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]). This is an important finding that
must be taken into consideration in genetic counselling, since the risk
for a mosaic parent to have another affected child is higher than that for
a genetically normal parent. Prenatal testing is available for at-risk
individuals (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Several of the COL3A1 mosaic cases have been studied in detail
(Kontusaari et al., 1992; Richards et al., 1992; Milewicz et al., 1993;
Palmeri et al., 2003; Stembridge et al., 2015). One such case was a
typical female vEDS patient with arterial ruptures, pneumothorax, easy
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
160
bruisability, and skin changes, who was found to have a single base
mutation leading to a Gly1018Asp change in the triple-helical domain
(Kontusaari et al., 1992). The parents had no signs of vEDS when last
examined in their 70's. When the inheritance of the mutation was investigated,
a surprising finding was that the mother also carried the
same mutation in nearly all of her blood leukocytes. Analyses of saliva
and hair samples from the mother revealed that approximately 40% of
the oral epithelial cells and 0 to 100% of the DNA from 28 hair roots
tested individually contained the single base mutation. Based on these
results, the mutation must have occurred after the first cell division of
the embryo, but before the differentiation of three major germ layers,
the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm (Kontusaari et al., 1992).
Another example of a mosaicism was in a family where the vEDS
patient had a 2-kb deletion in the COL3A1, and the patient's
phenotypically normal father also had this same deletion in some of his
cells (Milewicz et al., 1993). Approximately 80% of his cultured skin
fibroblasts, but only 20% of his blood leukocytes, carried the deletion.
The deletion was also found in his sperm cells, but due to a small
sample, quantification was not possible (Milewicz et al., 1993). The
authors interpreted the results to mean that the mutation occurred
during his embryologic development before the lineage allocation
happens.
The third example of a mosaicism was described in the unaffected
77-year old maternal grandmother of a male vEDS patient with a
Gly847Glu mutation (Richards et al., 1992). The patient had a spontaneous
carotid-cavernous sinus aneurysm and his mother died at the
age of 50 years from a bowel rupture. The patient's brother had thin
skin and joint laxity. The amount of type III collagen synthesized by the
Fig. 7. Schematic drawing of RNA splicing patterns
in three different COL3A1 splicing defects (A), and
two possible splicing mechanisms (B). G-to-A mutations
in the first nucleotide of introns 16, 20 and
42 of COL3A1 led to different splicing patterns,
which were experimentally validated by S1 nuclease
probe protection experiments and cDNA sequencing.
Solid lines indicate the most frequently used mode of
splicing and broken lines less frequently used. The
51 exons of COL3A1 are numbered 1–52 to match
the numbering of exons in the genes for other fibrillar
collagens. This research was originally published
in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

patient, his brother and mother was reduced. Additional biochemical
work on the patient's skin fibroblasts showed that the type III collagen
was overmodified. In addition, cyanogen bromide peptide mapping
demonstrated differences from the normal pattern. A genetic test using
allele specific hybridization on genomic DNA isolated from blood demonstrated
that all three affected family members and the maternal
grandmother were positive for the missense mutation. The findings on
the grandmother were confirmed with a second blood sample and hair
samples. Quantification of the amount of the mutant-to-normal allele
ratio was approximately 0.5 suggesting that about 2/3 of the grandmother's
cells carried the mutant allele.
The fourth example of a mosaicism was reported in a study on a
family in which the index patient and her mother had neurological
manifestations with leg and hand contractures, epilepsy and stroke in
addition to acrogeria and coiled cerebral vessels and dissections
(Palmeri et al., 2003). They harboured a missense mutation at aa 883
that converted a glycine to a valine. The asymptomatic maternal
grandmother with a slight ectasia of thoracic aorta was found to be a
mosaic for the same mutation.
The fifth example of a mosaicism was described in the father of a
female patient with a Pro1440Leu mutation in the C-terminal propeptide
of type III procollagen (Stembridge et al., 2015). The father showed
mild joint laxity, whereas the patient had thin skin, easy bruisability,
mild joint laxity, periodontal disease with gum recession, and a typical
acrogeria, but no vascular or bowel ruptures by the age of 27 years.
7.1.6. Biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations
The biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations have
been investigated extensively using cultured skin fibroblasts established
from skin biopsies (Tromp et al., 1989b; Kontusaari et al., 1990b;
Kontusaari et al., 1992; Richards et al., 1992; Narcisi et al., 1993;
Anderson et al., 1997; Okita et al., 2010). This is an ideal system to
study the consequences of the mutations, since skin biopsies are easy to
obtain and type III procollagen is expressed in these cells (see Section
7.1.1. for details).
Most patients are heterozygous for the mutation and therefore,
produce both normal and abnormal α chains of the type III procollagen.
Since three α chains are required to form a triple-helical structure, there
can be normal and mutant homotrimers, but also trimers that have
either one or two mutant α chains together with two or one normal α
chains. Altogether only one-eighth of the trimers are completely normal
and only one-eighth of the trimers are completely abnormal. For
structural stability, the heterotrimers with both normal and mutant α
chains folded together are the most problematic ones with aberrant
fibril formation leading to reduced strength.
It is also possible to carry out ultrastructural analyses of skin samples
taken from the patient and use light and electron microscopy for
the analysis. These studies have demonstrated a dilated rough endoplasmic
reticulum and changes in the diameter of collagen fibers
(Nuytinck et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1997).
More recent studies have used microarray-based transcriptomics to
determine which biological pathways are affected by COL3A1 mutations
in cultured skin fibroblasts (Chiarelli et al., 2018). Expression
profiles of skin cells from two patients who were each heterozygous for
the missense mutations, Gly237Arg and Gly612Asp, and a third patient
with an RNA slicing mutation in intron 14 were compared to expression
profiles of nine healthy age-matched controls (Chiarelli et al., 2018).
Altogether 969 genes were differentially expressed, 281 with increased
and 688 with decreased expression, between the vEDS and control
groups. Fibrillin-2 (FBN2) was the most differentially expressed gene
with decreased expression. Several of the genes with increased expression
in the patient cells were involved in transcriptional regulation
and re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The genes with decreased
expression belonged to such functional categories as cell cycle processes,
cell division, histones, cell movement and intracellular trafficking,
DNA damage response, and ribosomal RNA processing. A
pathway enrichment analysis revealed that cell cycle was the most affected
pathway. The proteasome system was also affected by having
several of the differentially expressed genes.
7.1.7. Genotype-phenotype correlations among vEDS patients
In a series of 1231 vEDS cases from a single laboratory, 630 index
cases and their 601 affected relatives were analysed for clinical features
and COL3A1 defects (Pepin et al., 2014). The median survival age
among men and women was 46 and 54 years, respectively. The causes
of deaths included vascular complications such as rupture and dissection,
and bowel perforations.
In this study, a total of 410 different COL3A1 mutations deemed to
be causative were found among the 572 index cases (Pepin et al., 2014).
Biochemical analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts had been carried out in
the remaining 58 index cases before genetic testing was available and
found to produce abnormal type III procollagen. The 410 different
mutations included 356 glycine substitutions, 164 RNA splicing mutations
and 52 other types of mutations (insertions, duplications or deletions).
In 27 vEDS patients the mutated allele led to an unstable RNA
through nonsense-mediated decay, and did not produce protein (null
mutations or haploinsufficiency).
Survival of vEDS patients with null mutations was 10–15 years
longer than in individuals harbouring RNA splicing or glycine mutations
(Pepin et al., 2014). Interestingly, survival among the patients
with glycine mutations differed based on the substituting amino acid; a
substitution of a valine or an aspartic acid meant worse survival than a
substitution of a serine (Pepin et al., 2014).
In another smaller series from France, 215 vEDS patients from 146
different families and with 126 different variants were investigated
(Frank et al., 2015). The overall findings were similar to those from the
larger series described above in that patients with glycine substitutions
(n=127) had poorer prognosis than patients with mutations leading to
haploinsufficiency (n=14) (Frank et al., 2015). There was, however,
no difference between male and female vEDS patients in the age when a
major clinical complication occurred. Interestingly, in this series the
vEDS patients with RNA splicing defects had earlier age at diagnosis
than patients with glycine substitutions (Frank et al., 2015). The authors
speculated that this could be due to differences in the clinical
practices between France and the USA.
7.2. Genetic studies for other human diseases
7.2.1. COL3A1 mutations in patients with brain disorders
Several patients with severe brain anomalies in addition to connective
tissue manifestations have been reported to harbour a pathogenic
variant in both COL3A1 alleles (Plancke et al., 2009; Jorgensen
et al., 2015; Horn et al., 2017; Vandervore et al., 2017). In human
genetics this is known as a compound heterozygosity, but they are now
called “biallelic variants” in the literature. Interestingly, the results
from imaging and histological analyses of the brain in the affected individuals
resemble those seen in patients with bilateral frontoparietal
polymicrogyria (OMIM 606854), who have mutations in GRP56 (Ke
et al., 2008). Since type III collagen is a ligand for GRP56, it is plausible
that those mutations in COL3A1 that interfere with the receptor-ligand
interaction or eliminate type III collagen altogether, manifest as this
neurological phenotype. It is also noteworthy, that the Col3a1+/− mice
manifest similar brain phenotype (see Section 8.1). One of these patients
had an Arg428Stop nonsense mutation in the paternal and a
deletion of one C in Pro686 leading to premature termination in the
maternal allele of COL3A1. As a consequence, the patient had no
functional type III collagen, and would be expected to have a very severe
phenotype. Each parent was heterozygous for one of these variants
and showed no clinical phenotype (Horn et al., 2017). Four other patients,
a sister and a brother, and two unrelated patients with delayed
speech and motor development and frontoparietal polymicrogyria were
reported to be homozygous for the same Pro49Ala variant (Horn et al.,

2017; Vandervore et al., 2017). Even though the variant was classified
as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on in silico scoring algorithms,
and it is intriguing that it was present in four patients, it is difficult to be
certain that it is the cause of the disease, since biological functional
studies did not yield any significant findings (Vandervore et al., 2017).
In another study by Jorgensen et al. (2015), two siblings were compound
heterozygotes for a mutation causing a premature termination at
aa 596 and a missense mutation in the C-terminal propeptide that
changed a glycine to a glutamic acid. One of these patients died suddenly
at the age of 15 of arterial dissections at three different sites, and
the other had a dissection in the internal carotid artery and cerebral
cortical dysplasia (micropolygyria). The four family members who were
heterozygous for the premature termination mutation had no clinical
manifestations, whereas the one family member who was heterozygous
for the missense mutation had thin, translucent skin, small joint hypermobility,
pulmonary emphysema and reduced aortic elasticity,
which are typical signs of vEDS (Jorgensen et al., 2015).
7.2.2. Studies for other human diseases using COL3A1 genetic variants
Since type III collagen is such an important structural component for
the integrity of blood vessels, several studies have investigated the
possibility that genetic variants in the COL3A1 gene increase the person's
risk for developing aneurysms. Despite of few isolated reports with
positive findings (Kontusaari et al., 1990b; Anderson et al., 1996; van
Keulen et al., 1999), larger studies using a comprehensive DNA sequencing
analysis of the entire triple-helical domain of type III procollagen
in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (Tromp et al.,
1993) and intracranial aneurysms (Kuivaniemi et al., 1993) found no
mutations that could explain the disease. Subsequently, an approach
called genetic association study (Romero et al., 2002) in which the
frequencies of the two alleles of COL3A1 polymorphisms were compared
in cases and controls, was used. No association was found between
aneurysms and the COL3A1 polymorphisms (Ogata et al., 2005;
Hinterseher et al., 2011). Furthermore, family-based DNA linkage studies
(Shibamura et al., 2004; Tromp et al., 2014) and genome-wide
association studies (Tromp et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2017) for abdominal
aortic aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms with large
sample sets have found no evidence that COL3A1 variants contribute to
the susceptibility of these conditions. Unlike the candidate gene approaches
which rely on prior knowledge about the pathobiology of the
disease and are based on educated guesses, these genome-wide approaches
are unbiased and decipher the entire human genome to find
statistical evidence for a linkage or an association. It should be noted
that such studies require large sample sets with thousands of cases and
controls to obtain reliable estimates of the disease risk (Romero et al.,
2002).
COL3A1 has been tested as a potential susceptibility gene for several
other clinical conditions (Muckian et al., 2002; Lv et al., 2014; Reichert
et al., 2018). One recent study investigated two COL3A1 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3134646 and rs1800225, among 422
patients with diverticulosis and 285 controls (Reichert et al., 2018). The
rs3134646 was associated with diverticulosis, but rs1800225 not, with
an odds ratio of 1.82 (95% confidence interval of 1.04–3.20) and
p=0.04. Due to the small sample size and only borderline significance,
the results will need validation and replication.
In another genetic association study, three COL3A1 SNPs
(rs2138533, rs11887092, and rs1800255) were analysed for their
contribution to the recurrence and prognosis of stroke in the Chinese
population (Lv et al., 2014). A total of 1544 stroke patients from three
different subtypes of stroke were included in the study and followed up
for 4.5 years. All three variants were associated with the risk for stroke
recurrence and prognosis independently from conventional risk factors.
Patients who had the A allele of rs1800255, had a lower risk for reoccurrence
of stroke, but an increased risk for all-cause mortality in the
atherothrombotic stroke subgroup. Again, due to the small sample size,
the results although statistically significant, can only be considered
suggestive and need further validation.
Muckian et al. (2002) assessed the role of genetic variability in
COL3A1 in coronary artery disease using a highly polymorphic intronic
tandem repeat as a marker. This repeat is located in intron 25 and has
between three and 13 copies of a 15-bp repeat (Mays et al., 1992). Four
of the alleles are common and were used in the study. The rationale for
selecting COL3A1 as the candidate gene for the study, was that it is
expressed in vascular wall and is known to interact with platelets. They
genotyped DNA samples obtained from individuals who were part of
three different cardiovascular studies and had a total of 1851 cases with
either acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction, unstable
coronary syndrome, or stable angina, in addition to 306 controls. The
authors concluded that COL3A1 variants modulate the risk for coronary
artery disease. As with all small human genetic studies, the results require
confirmation in an independent data set. Furthermore, in complex
phenotypes such as the coronary artery disease, the contribution of any
single genetic variant is expected to be small and explain only a small
fraction of the increased or decreased risk.
7.3. Altered COL3A1 mRNA and protein levels, or degradation in human
diseases
Accumulation of type III collagen is a hallmark of several chronic
human diseases that involve fibrotic processes including systemic
sclerosis, cardiac fibrosis, lung fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and renal fibrosis
(Table 2) (Jimenez et al., 1986; Krieg et al., 1986; Rosenbloom et al.,
2016; Fogo et al., 2017; Karsdal et al., 2017; Ricard-Blum et al., 2018).
Thus, a large number of studies have investigated the potential of using
the determination of the PIIINP levels (Risteli et al., 1988) in the urine
and serum as a biomarker for the presence of fibrosis. The N-terminal
propeptide is cleaved off enzymatically during the biosynthesis of type
III collagen (Fig. 3) and it has been proposed that its levels are a surrogate
marker for the amount of type III collagen in a given tissue.
Another serum test (C3M), developed more recently, measures the levels
of a 10-aa neoepitope of type III collagen generated by digestion
with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Barascuk et al., 2010). This test does
not recognize intact type III collagen, but is specific for the short peptide,
and can thus be used to measure type III collagen degradation. A
third test (C3C) was developed to measure fragments of type III collagen
generated by cathepsins B, L, S and K by ELISA and was tested in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
(Rasmussen et al., 2017). This test recognizes a neoepitope located in aa
642–651 of the α-chain of type III collagen. COPD patients (n=68) had
significantly elevated levels of C3C in their serum compared to healthy
controls (n=20). Serum tests of these three assays and any new tests to
be developed would provide an important clinical advancement for
diagnostics and monitoring treatment responses since they are minimally
invasive tests.
7.3.1. Cardiac diseases
The role of extracellular matrix proteins in the pathophysiology of
some of the major cardiovascular diseases has been studied extensively
(Prabhu and Frangogiannis, 2016; Frangogiannis, 2017). Extracellular
matrix accumulation in the heart tissue leads to cardiac fibrosis, scarring
that results from an injury, such as a myocardial infarction, and
leads to impaired function of the heart muscle (Krenning et al., 2010).
Many studies, however, do not distinguish what collagen type was
studied and just refer to collagen. Studies that have investigated type III
collagen specifically include those on the hypertrophic (Hayashi et al.,
1998; Kitamura et al., 2001) and dilated cardiomyopathy
(Marijianowski et al., 1995; Hayashi et al., 1998; Bonapace et al., 2006;
Herpel et al., 2006; Sivakumar et al., 2008), as well as pulmonary
vascular disease (Frangogiannis, 2017), and replacement fibrosis following
myocardial infarction (Herpel et al., 2006; Prabhu and
Frangogiannis, 2016). Type III collagen changes have also been studied
in a rare cardiomyopathy called idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
164
(Hayashi et al., 1998).
Marijianowski et al. (1995) studied the amount and distribution of
type I and III collagen in heart tissue samples obtained from patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy (n=19) and age-matched controls
(n=17) who died of non-cardiovascular diseases (Marijianowski et al.,
1995). Using biochemical and histological methods, they found that
both collagen types were increased in the diseased heart tissues, but the
increase was more pronounced in type I collagen and therefore the type
I-to-III –ratio increased. The authors speculated that this finding could
be clinically relevant and explain part of the disease characteristics,
since type III collagen gives more elastic properties to the tissue and
type I collagen is more rigid. The findings of increased type III collagen
levels being associated with dilated cardiomyopathy have subsequently
been validated in other studies (Hayashi et al., 1998; Sivakumar et al.,
2008).
Herpel et al. (2006) investigated several extracellular matrix proteins
in heart tissue samples obtained from patients diagnosed with
dilated (n=15), ischemic (n=17) and valvular cardiomyopathy
(n=7) using immunostaining (Herpel et al., 2006). They showed that
the different types of cardiomyopathies all had myocardial interstial
fibrosis, but that they differed in the distribution of various extracellular
matrix proteins. The amount of type III collagen was the
greatest in samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and
lowest in those from patients with valvular disease. Bonapace et al.
(2006) studied aortic stiffness in 89 patients diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy and found that serum PIIINP levels were correlated
with clinical parameters measuring aortic stiffness (Bonapace et al.,
2006).
Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare disease manifesting
as a diastolic dysfunction. Histologically the disease is characterized by
fibrosis in the heart tissue and hypertrophy of myocytes making the
heart tissue stiff. Hayashi et al. (1998) carried out a histological analysis
of endomyocardial biopsy samples (n=7) from these patients and
compared the findings to those from patients diagnosed with coronary
artery disease (n=5), hypertrophic cardiopathy (n=11) and dilated
cardiomyopathy (n=14). The results revealed a marked increase in the
amount of type III collagen deposited in the myocardial interstitium.
Kitamura et al. (2001) analysed histologically 35 heart tissue specimens
from 35 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Kitamura
et al., 2001). The amount of type III collagen protein detected in immunostaining
correlated with several cardiac metrics measuring diastolic
function and demonstrated that increased amount of fibrosis was
associated with poorer cardiac function. Interestingly, the amount of
type I collagen did not correlate with these metrics.
Thiele et al. (2004) found that the mRNA levels of hnRNP E1, K and
A1 were elevated in heart tissue samples from patients diagnosed with
aortic stenosis (n=18), and E1 and K were elevated in patients with
ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=6), compared to control heart tissue
samples (n=20) taken from hearts harvested for transplantation. As
described in Section 6, A1 and K bind to sequences in the 3′UTR of
COL3A1 mRNA to stabilize the transcript.
PIIINP has been tested as a potential marker for heart disease, but
the results have been contradictory. In a large community-based study
of 967 well-characterized participants, no correlation was found between
serum PIIINP levels and various cardiovascular risk factors such
as hypertension or diabetes (Wang et al., 2007). There was also no
correlation between echocardiographically-determined left ventricular
or atrial mass and PIIINP levels (Wang et al., 2007). Manhenke et al.
(2014) measured several biomarkers, including PIIINP, in serum samples
from 233 patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction within
the past three days (Manhenke et al., 2014). The patients were then
followed up for two years. Several of the other biomarkers including
type I collagen markers, but not PIIINP, changed during the follow-up
that included treatment with either losartan or captopril. In this study
PIIINP showed no prognostic value. The same authors (Manhenke et al.,
2014) analysed 42 patients with first-time myocardial infarction that
produced ST-elevation in an electrocardiogram. The patients underwent
percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. In
agreement with their earlier study, PIIINP levels stayed within normal
limits during the entire time. There was, however, an increase in PIIINP
levels during the first two days after the infarction, but the levels did
not exceed the normal limits.
In 2012, Fertin et al. (2012) carried out a systematic review on 59
published studies (Fertin et al., 2012) investigating the usefulness of
biomarkers predicting which myocardial infarction patients develop
left ventricular remodeling that leads to heart failure. PIIINP was one of
the biomarkers studied, but it was measured in only three studies for a
total of 210 patients. In all three studies the serum PIIINP levels were
correlated with left ventricular remodeling.
7.3.2. Other diseases
The histological hallmarks of chronic renal failure are glomerulosclerosis
and tubulointerstial fibrosis due to the accumulation of connective
tissue proteins (Soylemezoglu et al., 1997). Based on histological
analyses tubular epithelial cells in patients with diabetic
nephropathy synthesize increased amounts of type III collagen
(Razzaque et al., 1995). Individual studies on renal fibrosis have concluded
that PIIINP levels in the urine and serum correlate with the
amount of fibrosis present in the kidneys (Soylemezoglu et al., 1997). A
recent systematic review (Mansour et al., 2017) that included only
studies in which renal biopsy was used to verify the kidney disease,
however, concluded that PIIINP levels were not independently associated
with a chronic kidney disease after adjusting for proteinuria. In
another community-based study of 958 individuals ≥65 years, urine
PIIINP levels were found to increase with the progression of the kidney
disease and higher PIIINP levels were also associated with death (Ix
et al., 2015).
For liver diseases, PIIINP assay is part of the “Enhanced Liver
Fibrosis” (ELF) panel, which includes assays for three molecules: hyaluronic
acid, PIIINP, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1
(Tanwar et al., 2017). The ELF panel has been used as a surrogate
marker of liver fibrosis allowing a minimally invasive blood sampling
method to be used instead of obtaining a liver biopsy (Tanwar et al.,
2017). ELF score and PIIINP levels were also shown to be correlated
with skin and lung fibrosis in patients with systemic sclerosis (Abignano
et al., 2019).
Collagen accumulation and metabolism has also been studied extensively
in fibrotic lung diseases. For example, Kirk et al. (1984) carried
out a study on patients diagnosed with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.
They showed that the serum PIIINP concentrations were
increased in these patients compared to normal controls or patients
with non-fibrotic lung diseases. With biochemical analyses of lung
tissue samples they were able to demonstrate that the serum PIIINP
levels correlated with the type III to type I collagen ratios in the lung.
Interestingly, those patients with the highest serum PIIINP levels before
the treatment had the best response to treatment measured by improvements
in lung function tests forced vital capacity and transfer
coefficient values.
Another disease with type III collagen accumulation is Dupuytren's
disease, in which type III collagen is present in increased amounts in the
aponeurosis (Menzel et al., 1979; Somers et al., 1989). Collagen III
accumulation has been seen in yet another fibrotic condition called
Peyronie's disease, in which scar tissue forms in the tunica albuginea of
the penis as a result of currently unknown mechanism and leads to a
severely impaired function (Somers et al., 1989).
Elevated levels of type III collagen have also been seen in patients
with Crohn's disease. One study showed increased amounts of type III
collagen in fibroblast cultures originating from patients' intestine
(Stallmach et al., 1992). In another study C3M levels were higher in
serum samples from patients with the penetrating form of Crohn's disease
indicating increased breakdown of type III collagen by matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (van Haaften et al., 2017). The best marker to
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
165
differentiate between the different subtypes of Crohn's disease was the
ratio of type III collagen to C3M, reflecting an imbalance between the
synthesis and the breakdown of type III collagen. Another study was
able to differentiate between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using
serum biomarkers including the C3M assay (Mortensen et al., 2015).
Type III collagen expression has also been studied in non-fibrotic
diseases. In a study that investigated 33 patients with hyperthyroidism,
the serum levels of PIIINP were found to be elevated compared to 26
controls (Inui et al., 1992). The authors pointed out that the liver
function of these patients was normal.
Aigner et al. (1993) had an unexpected finding in that type III
collagen was present in dedifferentiated chondrocytes in cartilage
samples taken from patients with late stage osteoarthritis, when the
well-established expression profile of chondrocytes includes type II, IX
and XI collagens, but no type III collagen. In this study immunostaining
was used to investigate protein expression and in situ RNA hybridization
to determine the location and extent of mRNA expression. Interestingly,
these cells also expressed type II collagen, but no type I collagen.
Normal chondrocytes did not express any type III collagen (Aigner
et al., 1993). Another group, however, detected type III collagen even in
normal human articular cartilage specimens taken from individuals
between ages 17 and 81 years (Wotton and Duance, 1994).
Type III collagen expression has also been evaluated in cancer. In
one study where 33 glioma tissues samples were analysed, a significant
increase in COL3A1 mRNA levels was found and the increased expression
correlated with the tumor grade with high grade gliomas showing
the highest levels of expression (Gao et al., 2018). Immunohistological
staining of glioma tissues demonstrated the same results on the protein
level. In follow-up studies in which COL3A1 expression in a cell culture
system was silenced by siRNA, the proliferation and migration of
glioma cells was suppressed.
In another cancer study, overexpression of COL3A1 was found to be
associated with a poor prognosis of bladder cancer (Yuan et al., 2017).
Similarly, increased levels of PIIINP were associated with a poor
prognosis and a shorter overall survival of breast cancer patients
(Lipton et al., 2018).
8. Col3a1 mutant mice
Currently there are four different Col3a1 mouse models (Liu et al.,
1997; Smith et al., 2011; Long et al., 2015; D'Hondt et al., 2018). As can
be seen in Table 3, which summarizes the characteristics of these
models, none of them are ideal models of the human vEDS. They have,
however, become useful models for studying the function of type III
collagen in various tissues and organs.
8.1. Inactivation by knockout of the murine Col3a1 gene
Inactivation of the murine Col3a1 gene was carried out by homologous
recombination in embryonic stem cells using a targeting vector
in which the Col3a1 promoter and the first exon were deleted and replaced
by the neomycin gene (Liu et al., 1997). Approximately 95% of
the homozygous mutant mice died early on, with most deaths occurring
in the first two days after birth, but heterozygous mice appeared phenotypically
normal (Liu et al., 1997). The homozygous mice that survived
were smaller than their wild-type littermates, and they died at the
age of about 6 months from a rupture of major arteries or the bowel,
mimicking the human vEDS phenotype. These mice also had skin lesions,
such as open wounds. Histological analysis using light microscopy
did not reveal any obvious abnormalities in the analysed tissues.
Electron microscopy, however, demonstrated abnormal collagen fibers
in the skin, aorta, liver, lung, heart and bowel (Liu et al., 1997). These
studies provided important information to our basic understanding of
the fibrillogenesis of collagen by demonstrating that lack of type III
collagen led to disorganized type I collagen fibrils with variable diameters
(Liu et al., 1997). Type III collagen thus appears to regulate the

type I collagen fibril formation.
The homozygous Col3a1−/− mice were also studied for potential
brain defects, since COL3A1 is a ligand for GPR56, which harbors
mutations in patients with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, a
severe brain malformation (Jeong et al., 2012). In histological analyses
all Col3a1−/− mice showed a severe malformation of the brain cortex
at E18.5. The defects were described as cobblestone like cortical malformations
and included pial breakdown in the basement membrane,
neuronal overmigration, radial glial detachment, and formation of
marginal zone heterotopias. None of the heterozygous Col3a1+/− or
wildtype mice had these malformations. Based on these findings, type
III collagen appears to be important for brain development.
The heterozygous mutant mice of the same Col3a1 knock-out mouse
model were studied further by Cooper et al. (2010). Less collagen and
reduced amounts of Col3a1 mRNA were found in the abdominal aorta
and the wall strength was reduced. Similarly, the bowel walls from
these mice showed increased compliance and decreased strength, which
was tested by applying pressure and determining when the bowel wall
burst. Histological lesions found in the internal elastic lamina of the
aortae were more severe in older mice and more common in male mice
(Cooper et al., 2010). In conclusion, the heterozygous mice lack the
clinical features of vEDS, but do display several histological signs of
Col3a1 deficiency. A 9-month doxycycline treatment of heterozygous
(Col3a1+/−) mice reduced the number of histological lesions in the
aorta (Tae et al., 2012). This was most likely due to a decrease in Mmp9
expression, since doxycycline is a known inhibitor of MMPs.
The Col3a1 knock-out mouse model has been studied for many
different organ systems and biological processes including the bladder
function and healing of bone fractures. The amount of type III collagen
was reduced and the collagen fiber diameter more varied in the bladder
tissues of Col3a1+/−mice compared to wild-type mice (Stevenson et al.,
2006). In functional tests using bladder muscle strips removed from the
mice, the muscle removed from heterozygous mice generated less tension
and were more compliant suggesting that there is a critical level of
type III collagen required for normal bladder function.
A detailed analysis of the skeletons of the wild-type, Col3a1+/− and
Col3a1−/− mice at age 6–8 weeks was carried out using microcomputer
tomography (Volk et al., 2014). The results demonstrated a reduction in
several bone phenotypes including the bone volume, bone volume
fraction, connectivity density, structure model index and trabecular
thickness in the Col3a1+/− compared to the wild-type mice. In cell
culture experiments, mesenchymal progenitor cells isolated from the
Col3a1−/− mice had decreased activity of alkaline phosphatase and
impaired mineralization. The authors concluded that these findings
implied that type III collagen is involved in the formation of the trabecular
bone. Furthermore, using a bilateral tibial fracture model in the
heterozygous (Col3a1+/−) mice reduced levels of Col3a1 were shown
to impair the bone formation and alter remodeling during the healing of
the fractures (Miedel et al., 2015). Based on immunofluorescent
staining, fracture callus contained considerable amounts of type III
collagen, whereas very little or no type III collagen was detected in the
uninjured cortical bone.
8.2. A large deletion of the murine Col3a1 gene
Another mouse model with a large 185-kb deletion encompassing
the promoter region and the first 39 exons of the Col3a1 gene was first
discovered by its phenotype of sudden deaths due to thoracic aortic
dissections (Smith et al., 2011). The underlying genetic defect in these
mice was detected by genetic mapping and DNA sequencing. In followup
studies investigating 225 mice heterozygous for the deletion, aortic
dissection was seen in 28% and it was twice as common in male as
female mice. No skin or bowel problems were detected in any of the
mice. Mice homozygous for the deletion appeared to die before birth,
since no homozygous mice were found. Histological analyses of the
aortic wall showed reduced amounts of collagen in the media, but not
in the adventitia layer. Transmission electron microscopy images demonstrated
abnormal collagen fibers (Smith et al., 2011).
8.3. Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of Col3a1
The third currently available mouse model includes transgenic mice
overexpressing Col3a1 with a Gly182Ser mutation (D'Hondt et al.,
2018). A control transgenic mouse line overexpressing the normal
Col3a1 was also produced. The mice with the Gly182Ser transgene
developed severe skin wounds, demonstrated vascular fragility in the
form of reduced tensile strength and died prematurely at the age of
13–14 weeks (D'Hondt et al., 2018). Both skin and aorta contained
abnormal collagen fibrils, and there was less type III collagen in the
aortic wall (D'Hondt et al., 2018). The collagen type III:I ratio in the
skin changed from 0.5 in the non-transgenic mice to 1.0 in the transgenic
mice overexpressing normal Col3a1, to 0.3 in the transgenic mice
with the Gly182Ser mutation. There were no differences in the extent of
post-translational modifications or the thermal stability of the collagens
produced between the two transgenic mouse lines (D'Hondt et al.,
2018). The diameter of collagen fibers was more variable and the fibers
were generally thicker in the Gly182Ser transgenic mice than in the
other mouse lines.
8.4. Tsk2/+ mice with a missense mutation
The tight skin (Tsk2/+) mice resemble the human disease systemic
sclerosis. They were identified in a screening after mutagenic agent
ethylnitrosurea was used to generate mutations in the mouse genome
(Long et al., 2015). The defect was genetically mapped to mouse
chromosome 1, which harbors Col3a1. Sequencing of RNA and genomic
DNA identified a total of 265 sequence variants in both wild-type and
Tsk2/+ mice and they were thus excluded from further analyses.
Thirteen sequence variants were found in all four Tsk2/+ mice, but ten
of them were also found in another strain of mice and were excluded. Of
the remaining three sequence variants present only in the Tsk2/+
mice, two were in introns, and one was a missense variant in Col3a1
that converted a cysteine to a serine in the N-terminal propeptide. This
Cys-to-Ser change mutates one of the cysteine residues that are normally
part of intrachain disulphide bonds. Based on the RNA-sequencing
data, Col3a1 had the highest number of reads from the genes located
in the candidate interval, indicating that its expression was
increased, which is in agreement with previous biochemical studies.
Complementation experiments were carried out in which the Tsk2/+
mice were crossed with Col3a1−/+ mice to prove that the sequence
variant found in Col3a1 is Tsk2. The result showed that the Tsk2 gene
was not able to rescue the Col3a1-knockout phenotype.
9. Conclusions
Nearly 50 years of research into the structure and function of type
III collagen has demonstrated that it is an essential structural component
of blood vessels, uterus and bowel. Without type III collagen mice
die in utero and with mutated forms of it humans develop serious
clinical manifestations leading to a premature death due to a spontaneous
rupture of an artery, bowel or uterus. Furthermore, some
COL3A1 mutations lead to a severe brain abnormality and developmental
delay. Increased amounts of type III collagen are found in many
acquired human fibrotic diseases such as kidney and liver fibrosis, and
systemic sclerosis. Type III collagen is known to interact with type I and
II collagens in the fibril formation and is an important regulator of fibril
diameter; increase in type III collagen content will lead to the formation
of thinner fibrils. Type III collagen is also a critical component in platelet
aggregation and thus initiating the blood clotting cascade.
There are still several unanswered questions about the function of
type III collagen, e.g., what are the molecules it interacts with, is it
possible to create a computational model that predicts the effects of a
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
167
COL3A1 mutation accurately, and how do we prevent overexpression of
type III collagen and fibrotic processes. It is also not clear why some
COL3A1 mutations lead to vEDS, whereas others manifest as a severe
brain abnormality. The classic vEDS manifests as an autosomal dominant
disease, but in the case of the brain abnormality, all reported cases
have had two mutant COL3A1 alleles suggesting an autosomal recessive
inheritance pattern. To facilitate answering these important research
questions with implications to human health, additional animal models
are required.

Collagen alpha-1(III) chain, also known as the alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, is a protein that in humans is
encoded by the COL3A1 gene. Three alpha 1 chains are required to form the type III collagen molecule which has
a long triple-helical domain. Type III collagen, an extracellular matrix protein, is synthesized by cells as a preprocollagen.
It is found as a major structural component in hollow organs such as large blood vessels, uterus and
bowel. Other functions of type III collagen include interaction with platelets in the blood clotting cascade and it
is also an important signaling molecule in wound healing. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene cause the vascular type
of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS; OMIM 130050). It is the most serious form of EDS, since patients often die
suddenly due to a rupture of large arteries. Inactivation of the murine Col3a1 gene leads to a shorter life span in
homozygous mutant mice. The mice die prematurely from a rupture of major arteries mimicking the human
vEDS phenotype. The biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations have been studied extensively. Most
of the glycine mutations lead to the synthesis of type III collagen with reduced thermal stability, which is more
susceptible for proteinases. Intracellular accumulation of this normally secreted protein is also found.
Ultrastructural analyses have demonstrated dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and changes in the diameter of
collagen fibers. Other clinical conditions associated with type III collagen are several types of fibroses in which
increased amounts of type III collagen accumulate in the target organs.

1. Introduction
Type III collagen, first identified and described in 1971 (Miller et al.,
1971), is an important structural protein, classified as one of the major
fibrillar collagens (Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995). It constitutes about
5–20% of the entire collagen content in the human body (Miller, 1988).
Its essential role in the structural integrity of arteries, uterus and bowel
has been clearly demonstrated by studies on patients who harbour
mutations in the COL3A1 gene (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]; Byers
et al., 2017; Malfait et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). The cardinal clinical
manifestations of these patients include spontaneous, life-threatening
arterial, uterine and bowel ruptures (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]; Byers
et al., 2017; Malfait et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). Other clinical phenotypes
associated with COL3A1 missense and nonsense mutations include
severe brain anomalies suggesting that COL3A1 is essential for
the normal brain development.
This review summarizes the information on the human (COL3A1)
and mouse (Col3a1) gene, transcripts and protein, and discusses the
disease phenotypes associated with type III collagen mutations and
altered protein levels, as well as mouse models. Table 1 lists the characteristics
of the human (COL3A1) and mouse (Col3a1) gene, transcripts
and protein, and provides links to available resources.
2. Chromosomal location and intron-exon organization of
COL3A1 and Col3a1
In the human genome, COL3A1 encoding the α1 chain of type III
collagen is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 [2q32.2; genomic
coordinates (GRCh38): Chr2:188,974,320-189,012,746]. The gene is
approximately 38 kb long and has 51 exons, which are numbered 1–52
to match the numbering of exons in the genes for other fibrillar collagens
(Fig. 1) (Valkkila et al., 2001). The sizes of the exons vary from
45 nt (exons 13, 15, 18 and 30) to 1105 (exon 52) (Valkkila et al.,
2001). All exons except exon 2 begin with a complete codon, and all
exons encoding the triple-helical domain start with a codon for a glycine
(Valkkila et al., 2001). The first intron at approximately 11.5 kb is
the largest one in the COL3A1 gene, whereas the second largest intron is
1500 bp and the smallest intron is only 85 bp.
COL3A1 gene is in tail-to-tail orientation with a gene for another
fibrillar collagen, namely COL5A2 (Valkkila et al., 2001). The sequence
between these two genes is about 22 kb and it contains several repeat
sequences including a LINE-1, two AT, and an Alu repeat (Valkkila

entry COL3A1-202 exist and they appear to
be purely computational entities. Furthermore,
exon coverage data based on RNAsequencing
shows no evidence for extensive
alternative splicing. The figure was generated
using GeneBank entry NM_000090.3,
and a software package UGENE
(Okonechnikov et al., 2012). See Fig. 4 for
schematic drawing of the different functional
domains.

et al., 2001). A phylogenetic analysis for the human COL3A1 and
COL5A2 genes based on the sequences of the carboxy (C)-terminal
domains indicated that these two genes likely evolved from a common
ancestor (Valkkila et al., 2001).
Genetic variation present in the COL3A1 gene has been compared
between four ethnic groups, namely African American, European,
Mexican and Chinese (Chan et al., 2008). DNA samples from 48 unrelated
individuals from each of these four groups were analysed for all
the exonic and some intronic regions of four collagen genes (COL1A1,
COL1A21, COL2A1 and COL3A1). A total of 114 polymorphic sites were
identified in COL3A1, only four (Ala679Thr, Thr698Ala, Val1205Ile,
and Gln1353His) of which led to an amino acid change. Phylogenetic
trees generated using these results demonstrated that the African
American group was evolutionary separated from the other three
groups when COL3A1 sequences were analysed.
Two transcripts, 4.8 kb and 5.5 kb are generated from the COL3A1
gene using different polyadenylation sites (Fig. 2) (Ala-Kokko et al.,
1989).
In the mouse genome, Col3a1 encoding the mouse α1 chain of type
III collagen is located on the chromosome 1 [genomic coordinates
(GRCm38): Chr1:45311538-45349706]. The gene is similar in size to
the human COL3A1 gene with a length of approximately 38 kb and 51
exons. The exon-intron organization is also identical to that of the
human COL3A1 gene (Toman and de Crombrugghe, 1994; Valkkila
et al., 2001).
3. Protein structure
3.1. Biosynthesis of type III preprocollagen
Type III collagen is synthesized by cells as a pre-procollagen, which
undergoes multiple co- and posttranslational modifications (Fig. 3). The
signal peptide is cleaved off producing a procollagen molecule (Fig. 2).
Three identical type III procollagen chains come together in the Cterminal
ends, and the structure is stabilized by the formation of disulphide
bonds. Each individual chain folds into left-handed helix and
the three chains are then wrapped together into a right-handed superhelix,
the triple helix (Bachinger et al., 1980; Birk and Silver, 1984;
Boudko and Engel, 2004). Prior to assembling the super-helix, each
monomer is subjected to a number of post-translational modifications
that occur while the monomer is being translated. First, on the order of
145 prolyl residues of the 239 in the triple-helical domain are hydroxylated
to 4-hydroxyproline by prolyl-4-hydroxylase. Second, some of
the lysine residues are hydroxylated or glycosylated, and some lysine as
well as hydroxylysine residues undergo oxidative deamination catalysed
by lysyl oxidase. Other post-translational modifications occur
after the triple helix is formed. The large globular domains from both
ends of the molecule are removed by C- and amino(N)-terminal-proteinases
to generate triple-helical type III collagen monomers called
tropocollagen. In addition, crosslinks form between certain lysine and
hydroxylysine residues. In the extracellular space in tissues, type III
collagen monomers assemble into macromolecular fibrils, which aggregate
into fibers, providing a strong support structure for tissues requiring
tensile strength (Fig. 3).
There are two types of hydroxylations of proline residues, namely
the formation of 4-hydroxyproline and 3-hydroxyproline, by two different
enzymes (Weis et al., 2010). 4-hydroxyprolines are known to
stabilize the triple helix, whereas the exact function of 3-hydroxyproline
is not known, but it could be associated with inter-triple-helical
interactions and supramolecular assembly. Between one and six 3-hydroxyprolines
in each pro-α-chain are found in human fibrillar procollagens
I, II, V, and XI, but none in the human type III procollagen
although the chicken type III procollagen has one 3-hydroxyproline at
position 986 (Weis et al., 2010).
The C-propeptides are important in the biosynthesis of fibrillar
collagens by directing the chain selection, stabilizing the associated α
chains by the formation of interchain disulphide bonds, and facilitating
the formation of the triple helix (Boudko and Engel, 2004; Bourhis
et al., 2012; DiChiara et al., 2018). In type III procollagen, the C-propeptide
has eight cysteine residues and an N-glycosylation site. To facilitate
the functional analyses, a recombinant form of the C-propeptide
of type III collagen was expressed in a baculovirus system (Zafarullah
et al., 1997). It was secreted into the medium and was shown to contain
the expected inter- and intrachain disulphide bonds. In 2012, Bourhis
et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of the human C-propeptide
of type III procollagen (Bourhis et al., 2012). This study provided the
three-dimensional structure of the homotrimeric propeptide and has
facilitated the prediction of functional consequences of COL3A1 mutations
occurring in the C-propeptide.
Production of a full-length recombinant COL3A1 protein has been
hampered by the large number of posttranslational modifications required
in the biosynthesis of collagens (Tomita et al., 1995; Shi et al.,
2017). The most successful approach has been the use of a baculovirus
expression system (Tomita et al., 1995; Lamberg et al., 1996), which
yielded type III collagen molecules with stable triple helix, but their
melting temperature was lower than that from cultured skin fibroblasts
(Tomita et al., 1995). When the insect cells were co-transfected with
human prolyl-4-hydroxylase, the recombinant type III procollagen was
disulphide-bonded and the pepsin-digested collagen had a thermal
stability of 41 °C in a trypsin-chymotrypsin assay, a result comparable
to that for a native type III collagen (Lamberg et al., 1996). In subsequent
experiments using a yeast expression system, an intriguing
finding was that co-expression of type III procollagen together with
prolyl-4-hydroxylase, a key enzyme responsible for hydroxylating proline
residues during collagen biosynthesis, markedly increased the
amount of active prolyl-4-hydroxylase even though there was no
change in the mRNA levels (Vuorela et al., 1997). The authors concluded
that the increase in this activity was most likely due to an increased
association of enzyme subunits to form the active enzyme tetramer
and that in the absence of a collagen substrate the enzyme
subunits rapidly dissociated.
The crystal structure has been determined for a synthetic triplehelical
peptide with 42 amino acids (aa) that correspond to aa
991–1032 in the type III procollagen and contain the so called Cterminal
cysteine knot, the region with a disulphide bond (Boudko
et al., 2008). The analyses of the structure demonstrated that the
multiple non-imino acids in this peptide, are part of direct intra- and
interhelical contacts, and could interact with other extracellular matrix
components (Boudko et al., 2008).
3.2. Structure of type III preprocollagen, procollagen and collagen
The triple-helical conformation, which is a characteristic feature of
all fibrillar collagens, is possible because of the presence of a glycine as
every third amino acid in the sequence of about 1000 amino acids. This
(Gly-Xaa-Yaa)n sequence is repeated 343 times in the type III collagen
molecule. Proline or hydroxyproline is often found in the X- and Yposition
giving the triple helix stability (Figs. 2 and 4).
The exact amino acid sequence was first determined by partial
amino acid sequencing of bovine (Glanville and Fietzek, 1976; Fietzek
et al., 1979; Brandt et al., 1984) and human (Gilbert et al., 1978; Seyer
and Kang, 1981) type III collagen. Recombinant DNA technology then
made it possible to obtain complementary DNA (cDNA) clones from
chicken (Yamada et al., 1983), mouse (Wood et al., 1987), and human
(Loidl et al., 1984; Chu et al., 1985; Miskulin et al., 1986; Mankoo and
Dalgleish, 1988; Toman et al., 1988; Ala-Kokko et al., 1989; Janeczko
and Ramirez, 1989) samples to determine the nucleotide sequence of
the type III preprocollagen transcripts (Fig. 2). The cDNA and amino
acid sequences between human, mouse and bovine type III collagen are
very similar (Ala-Kokko et al., 1989).
Comparison of the human type III procollagen cDNA sequence to
those of other two major fibrillar collagen chains, the α1 and α2 chains

of type I procollagen, revealed that the triple-helical domain of the type
III procollagen is 15 amino acid longer (1029 aa) than the triple-helical
domains (1014 aa) of the two other α chains (Ala-Kokko et al., 1989).
There were also differences in the lengths of the other functional domains,
the largest difference being in the length of the N-propeptides,
which is only 57 aa in the α2 chain of type I procollagen, but 139 and
129 aa in the α1 chains of type I and type III procollagen, respectively
(Ala-Kokko et al., 1989). The codon usage for glycine, proline and
alanine in the triple-helical domain was similar between the type I and
type III collagen in that it favoured U as the third base (Ala-Kokko et al.,
1989).
4. Tissue distribution
Type III collagen is found as a major structural component in hollow
organs such as large blood vessels, uterus and bowel, tissues that must
withstand stretching. It is also found in many other tissues in association
with type I collagen. During the development of an embryo, type I
and III collagen seem to be expressed in a coordinated manner based on
a comprehensive survey of different developmental stages (E7.5 to
E17.5) of the mouse embryo using in situ RNA hybridization
(Niederreither et al., 1995). In another study that analysed COL3A1
mRNA levels in human fetal tissues, the expression patterns of COL1A1
and COL3A1 were quite different in the developing skeletal tissues and
the authors suggested that this might mean that they are under different
regulatory mechanisms (Sandberg et al., 1989).
Many early studies were not able to extract type III collagen from
bone, and concluded that bone did not contain type III collagen. The
first study to show that human bone does contain type III collagen was a
histological analysis by Keene et al. (1991) and used monoclonal antibodies.
Type III collagen-containing fibers were found in all samples
from donors between ages of 30 weeks to 80 years. Type III collagen

was detected throughout the cortex, but was concentrated at the Haversian
canal surface and the bone-periosteal interface.
A detailed mRNA expression analysis based on RNA-sequencing of
27 different human organs and tissues from 95 individuals was carried
out by Fagerberg et al. (2014). COL3A1 mRNA had a high level of expression
in the gall bladder, placenta, bladder and endometrium
(Fig. 5A). It was also detected in various parts of the gastrointestinal
track, fat, heart, prostate, skin, spleen and testis. Unfortunately the
sample collection did not contain blood vessels.
A similar analysis was carried out in the mouse using 69 samples
from different tissues and developmental stages (Yue et al., 2014). The
results showed that Col3a1 expression was high in the bladder, mammary
gland, placenta, fat and in the limbs of E14.5 mouse embryos
(Fig. 5B). Col3a1 mRNA was also detectable in the gastrointestinal
track, heart, kidney, lung, ovary, and mouse embryonic brain and liver,
but not in the adult mouse brain or liver.
Expression of type III collagen has also been studied in different
benign and malignant tumors using immunostaining (d'Ardenne et al.,
1984). All tumor samples were positive for type III collagen. Of the
benign tumors, leiomyomas, and giant cell tumors of tendon sheaths
had the highest level of type III collagen expression, whereas among the
malignant tumors, leiomyosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and sarcomas had
the highest expression.
5. Function
Type III collagen provides tensile strength and integrity for many
organs, but it has also been reported to have several other functions. In
tissues the diameter of type III collagen fibrils is smaller than that of
type I collagen (Birk and Silver, 1984). Type I and III collagens
sometimes appear in the same fibrils and in that situation type III collagen
regulates the fibril diameter (Fleischmajer et al., 1990; Cameron
et al., 2002). Type III collagen is also found in the adult human cartilage
and it has been suggested that its role is to act as a modifier of the fibril
network composed of type II collagen together with other minor collagens
during tissue healing (Wu et al., 2010). Type III collagen molecules
appear to be cross-linked to the surface of type II collagen fibrils.
Interestingly, most of the type III collagen molecules found to be present
in the cartilage were not fully processed (see Section 3) and contained
disulphide-bonded N-terminal propeptides.
One of the earliest studies on type III collagen in 1975 showed that
it influences the aggregation of human platelets (Balleisen et al., 1975).
Follow-up studies demonstrated that one peptide generated by a cyanogen
bromide treatment of calf skin type III collagen could facilitate
platelet adhesion in human blood (Fauvel et al., 1978). The peptide was
broken down further by chymotrypsin and hydroxylamine to narrow
down the amino acid residues responsible for this function. Further
evidence on the interaction between collagens and platelets was provided
by Balleisen et al. (1979), when they demonstrated that aggregation
of platelets could be inhibited by coating the collagen fibrils
with antibodies directed towards types I, II and III collagens thereby
preventing the direct physical contact between platelets and collagens.
Chiang et al. (1993) isolated a 47-kDa membrane protein from platelets
and showed that it interacted with type III collagen. It is now known
that platelets interact with type III collagen through specific glycoproteins
and non-integrin receptors (Monnet and Fauvel-Lafeve, 2000).
Jarvis et al. (2008) used 57 synthetic peptides, the sequence of which
was derived from the sequence of COL3A1 and which could form a
triple-helix, and tested their ability to interact with human and mouse
platelets. A peptide with three hydroxyproline residues was found to
Fig. 5. Distribution of COL3A1 mRNA in human (A) and mouse (B) tissues. RNA-sequencing data by Fagerberg et al. (2014) for the human and Yue et al. (2014) for
the mouse tissues were used to generate these figures.

bind to glycoprotein VI in platelets.
Type III collagen also functions in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation
and differentiation through its interaction with integrins,
which are cell surface receptors (Kim et al., 2005). The sites present in
type III procollagen and showing high affinity to bind integrins are
located in the C-terminal region (Kim et al., 2005).
It is likely that future research will identify additional binding sites
in the type III collagen molecule for its interaction partners. This is
facilitated by the Collagen Toolkit designed by the investigators at
Cambridge University in the United Kingdom (https://collagentoolkit.
bio.cam.ac.uk/). The toolkit contains 57 overlapping peptides corresponding
to the triple-helical domain of type III collagen. The peptides
can be used in a 96-well format for mapping binding sites.
Based on measurements in the fluid collected from surgical wounds,
peritoneum and serum of patients who underwent surgical procedures,
the N-terminal propeptide levels of type III procollagen (PIIINP) increased
2–3 days after surgery (Haukipuro et al., 1987). At day 5 after
the surgery, the serum PIIINP levels were 1000-fold higher in surgical
patients than in non-surgical patients. These findings suggest that type
III collagen is required for wound healing.
6. Regulation of COL3A1 expression
Several lines of evidence suggest that COL3A1 expression is regulated
also on the posttranscriptional level. The biological pathways
involved in the regulation of COL3A1 expression include the transforming
growth factor (TGF) β1, Wnt/β-catenin, and the p38 mitogenactivated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These studies have important
implication for the developing new treatment strategies for fibrosis
in different organs (see Section 7.3).
Several studies have demonstrated that hypoxia alters type III collagen
expression. Duval et al. (2009) showed that hypoxia led to a
decrease in both mRNA and protein levels of COL3A1 in cultured
chondrocytes (Duval et al., 2009). A similar response was seen when
using transient expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF-1ɑ),
and the authors concluded that the effect is mediated by HIF-1ɑ. Zhang
et al. (2018) found an opposite result when using cultured rat pulmonary
microvascular endothelial cells under hypoxia (Zhang et al.,
2018). In this experimental system hypoxia led to an increase in Col3a1
mRNA levels.
Samokhin et al. (2018) studied the molecular interactions in human
pulmonary arterial hypertension using an in silico approach, and generated
a “fibrosome” consisting of protein-protein interactions important
for lung fibrosis (Samokhin et al., 2018). Next, they incorporated
into this network genes known to be regulated by
aldosterone. This in silico analysis resulted in identifying NEDD9 as the
key molecule in regulating gene expression that leads to pulmonary
fibrosis, vascular remodeling, and pulmonary hypertension. The authors
then went on to verify the findings experimentally and demonstrated
that hypoxia increased NEDD9 and COL3A1 expression in
human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and that this was independent
of TGFβ1 signaling. Nedd9-deficient mice exposed to hypoxia
had decreased amounts of Col3a1 and decreased systolic pressure
of the right ventricle. They concluded that NEDD9 targets COL3A1 to
promote endothelial fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension and
that oxidative modification of a cysteine residue in NEDD9 and paracrine
signaling of exosomes were the two mechanisms responsible for
this.
In response to hypoxia, injury or metabolic stress cells release
adenosine, a purine generated from ATP and ADP. Shaikh et al. (2016)
showed that in human skin fibroblasts adenosine acts through its receptors
and stimulates COL3A1 expression via the canonical and noncanonical
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Shaikh et al., 2016). Interestingly,
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was not involved in type I
collagen expression in this experimental system.
When investigating the potential mechanisms leading to chronic
allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model, Kilic et al. (2011)
discovered that a protein called the nerve growth factor induced the
expression of type III collagen (Kilic et al., 2011). A treatment of the
mice with an antibody against the nerve growth factor prevented this
induction. The nerve growth factor was shown to signal through the
MAPK pathway. Inhibition of this pathway in mouse lung fibroblasts
prevented induction of COL3A1 expression by the nerve growth factor.
Yamane et al. (2018) investigated the role of branched amino acids
leucine and isoleucine in the expression of Col1a1 and Col3a1 in the
skin of mice deficient in branched-chain ɑ-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase,
which inactivates the enzyme involved in catabolizing branched
amino acids (Yamane et al., 2018). Leucine and isoleucine levels were
low in these mice. Col1a1 and Col3a1 mRNA and protein levels were
also low compared to wild type mice. The authors found indirect evidence
that the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
was also decreased. Branched amino acids are known to signal via
mTOR.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF; also called FGF2) enhanced the expression of COL3A1 mRNA
and protein in human skin fibroblasts via MAPK signaling (Shen et al.,
2018). Using human amniotic fibroblast cultures and explants of amniotic
tissue, Mi et al. (2018) demonstrated that cortisol decreased
COL3A1 protein, but not mRNA levels (Mi et al., 2018). Further studies
revealed that the reduction in protein levels was likely due to degradation
mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Yuan et al.
(2018) treated cultured human skin fibroblasts with TGFβ1 and found
that the mRNA levels of COL3A1 were increased (Yuan et al., 2018).
A study by Chen et al. (2018) investigated the role of long noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs) in hypertrophic scars and found that one
lncRNA had lower levels (Chen et al., 2018). In cultured skin fibroblasts
overexpressing this same lncRNA reduced COL3A1 mRNA levels.
Thiele et al. (2004) identified two mRNA-binding proteins called
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1 and K that bind
to sequences in the 3′UTR of COL3A1 mRNA (Thiele et al., 2004). Their
experiments demonstrated that hnRNP K stabilized the COL3A1 mRNA,
which resulted in increased expression. They also showed that TGFβ1
activates the synthesis of these hnRNPs as well as the synthesis of type
III collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. Other studies have shown that the
response to TGFβ1 varies based on the embryological origin of the cells
(see Kuivaniemi et al., 2015); thus it is not possible to say if the regulatory
mechanisms are the same in other vascular beds.
7. Diseases associated with COL3A1 mutations and variants, or
altered levels of COL3A1 protein
Mutations in the COL3A1 gene cause the vascular type of Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome (vEDS; OMIM 130050), which is a rare, life-threatening
genetic disease. A few patients with arterial aneurysms without
clear signs of EDS have also been found to have COL3A1 mutations
(Kontusaari et al., 1990b). Other disease phenotypes associated with
COL3A1 include a brain abnormality characterized by frontoparietal
polymicrogyria, and many fibrotic diseases, in which increased
amounts of type III collagen are found in various organs.
7.1. COL3A1 defects in patients with vEDS and other forms of EDS
vEDS (OMIM130050; ICD-10: Q79.6), previously known as the arterial-
ecchymotic EDS, Sack-Barabas syndrome, EDSIV and EDS type 4,
is the most serious form of EDS, since patients often die suddenly due to
a rupture of large arteries or other hollow organs (Pope et al., 1977;
Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]; Pope et al., 1996; Pepin et al., 2014; Byers
et al., 2017; Malfait et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). Other clinical manifestations
of vEDS can include cigarette paper-like scarring of the skin,
large ecchymoses over bony protuberances due to bruising, skin so thin
that subcutaneous vessels are readily visible, joint laxity that is usually
confined to fingers, pneumothorax, acrogeria, talipes equinovarus,
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
158
keratoconus, gingival recession and fragility, and early-onset varicose
veins, but the clinical picture of vEDS can be quite heterogeneous even
among members of the same family (Pope et al., 1977; Pope et al.,
1996; Malfait et al., 2017). The median life expectancy is 50 years, and
most patients develop major complications before the age of 30 years.
Penetrance is 100% for mutations with autosomal dominant inheritance,
but shows age-dependence. Patients with heterozygous null
mutations usually have milder phenotype and these mutations have a
lower penetrance of approximately 50% (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
The inheritance mode of vEDS is autosomal dominant.
Approximately 50% of the vEDS patients have no family history of the
disease and the disease is due to de novo mutations (Byers, 1993 [updated
2019]). Prevalence estimate is 1–9/100,000, but it is likely that
many vEDS cases are undiagnosed. It is estimated that there are approximately
1500 vEDS cases in the USA (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Clinical diagnosis of vEDS is often difficult without genetic testing
for COL3A1 mutations. vEDS diagnosis should be suspected in individuals
with spontaneous ruptures of arteries, uterus or bowel at
young age and the diagnosis confirmed by DNA sequencing. Once a
mutation has been identified in the patient, testing for the at-risk relatives
should also be offered (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Clinical management of vEDS patients often requires a multidisciplinary
team of medical experts including primary care physicians,
genetic counsellors, human geneticists, radiologists, vascular surgeons,
general surgeons, gastroenterologists, and obstetricians. Evaluations
should include blood pressure monitoring, and arterial screening by
ultrasound, magnetic resonance or computed tomography imaging to
detect dissections and dilatations (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019];
Eagleton, 2016; Byers et al., 2017; Malfait, 2018). Procedures such as
arteriograms, colonoscopies and elective surgeries should be avoided
due to tissue fragility, which could lead to complications. When surgical
treatment is needed, if feasible, it should be performed by surgeons
experienced in treating vEDS patients and familiar with the higher risks
associated with the care of these patients (Eagleton, 2016).
Only one clinical trial for a potential drug therapy to prevent vascular
events in vEDS patients has been published (Ong et al., 2010). In
this study, carried out in France and Belgium, celiprolol, a
cardioselective β-blocker with β2-agonist vasodilatation effects, was
used. Altogether 53 vEDS patients, 33 (62%) of whom were later confirmed
to have vEDS based on genetic testing, were randomly assigned
to treatment (n=25) or no treatment (n=28) groups. The trial was
ended early at 64 months due to the small number of patients available
for follow-up who had not developed any of the vascular events. Although
the authors concluded that celiprolol reduced the risk of arterial
complication, the study has been criticized for its small size, and the
fact that about third of the patients did not have COL3A1 mutations
(Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Female vEDS patients are at increased risk for pregnancy-related
complications based on a study on 616 pregnancies of 283 women with
confirmed COL3A1 defects (Murray et al., 2014) and should be followed
in a high-risk obstetric program (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]). In this
study, a total of 30 (4.9%) pregnancies resulted in the death of the
mother due to an arterial dissection or rupture, a uterine rupture, or
complications during a cesarean section. All of the deaths occurred in
women who had protein-altering COL3A1 mutations, whereas no
deaths were seen in the 51 pregnancies among the 27 women with
COL3A1 null mutations. The authors of this study also compared the
overall death rates of these women who had been pregnant to those
who had not, but had a genetically-confirmed vEDS diagnosis (n=243
nulliparous vEDS patients) and found that the overall survival rates
were similar in these two groups of women (Murray et al., 2014).
7.1.1. Protein analyses with skin fibroblasts taken from patients with vEDS
Before DNA analyses became feasible, skin biopsies were taken from
patients suspected of having vEDS and biochemical analyses were
carried out using cultured skin fibroblasts (Pope et al., 1975; Byers
et al., 1981; Stolle et al., 1985). These analyses involved culturing cells
in the presence of a radioactive proline, which was incorporated into
the newly synthesized collagens. It was then feasible to analyse the
secreted and intracellular proteins separately and assess intracellular
accumulation and secretion of collagens which have a high proline
content.
Additional analyses included “stress tests” in which the proteins
were subjected to a proteinase digestion at different temperatures
(Stolle et al., 1985; Tromp et al., 1989a; Tromp et al., 1989b;
Kontusaari et al., 1990b; Narcisi et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1997).
Properly folded type III procollagen can withstand a trypsin-chymotrypsin
treatment to 41 °C, but procollagen molecules containing mutations
will break down at lower temperatures due to unfolding of cooperative
blocks within the triple helix and expose the proteinase-sensitive
sites of the molecule. Another test was to carry out digestion with
collagenase, which cleaves normal type III procollagen at a very specific
site at aa 781 of the triple-helical domain (Fig. 6). The procollagen can
also be digested by pepsin, which will remove the globular propeptides,
the end result being collagen (Kontusaari et al., 1990b; Nuytinck et al.,
1992; Narcisi et al., 1993).
Increased amounts and intracellular accumulation of this normally
secreted protein are also often found (Anderson et al., 1997) in addition
to the synthesis of an overmodified type III collagen showing retarded
migration on a polyacrylamide gel (Nuytinck et al., 1992; Richards
et al., 1992; Narcisi et al., 1993). In some cases, the type III collagen
protein was digested with cyanogen bromide and the various peptides
analysed to map the defect (Nuytinck et al., 1992; Richards et al.,
1992).
7.1.2. DNA analyses and a mutation database for patients with vEDS
The first COL3A1 DNA study based on a preliminary Southern blot
analysis of a vEDS patient identified an approximately 3.3-kb deletion
in COL3A1 in 1988 (Superti-Furga et al., 1988). In a subsequent publication
three years later, DNA sequencing of the breakpoints of the
deletion demonstrated that it was much larger and included 16 exons
and approximately 7.5 kb of genomic DNA (Lee et al., 1991). Based on a
large number of studies that have screened for mutations in COL3A1 in
Fig. 6. Thermal unfolding of type III collagen from a patient with a Gly619Arg
mutation in COL3A1. Skin fibroblasts were obtained from the patient and a
control. The effect of a single base missense mutation was tested on the type III
collagen protein by using a proteinase assay. The type III collagen was first
digested with collagenase which cleaves the molecule at aa 781. This was then
followed by digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin. A large fraction of the
patient's type III collagen was digested to a fragment of approximately 620 aa at
temperatures 20-36 °C. In comparison the type III collagen isolated from control
fibroblasts stayed intact and did not break down until at 38 °C.

patients with vEDS, large deletions and insertions are not a common
type of mutations in these patients.
The first glycine mutation in the triple-helical domain was reported
in 1989 in a study that was also the first detailed DNA analysis of a
COL3A1 mutation using DNA sequencing both on the genomic and
cDNA level (Tromp et al., 1989a). This mutation changed a glycine at
aa position 790 to a serine (Gly790Ser; numbering from the beginning
of the triple-helical domain) (Tromp et al., 1989a).
A total of 63 COL3A1 mutations were summarized in a review article
published in 1997 (Kuivaniemi et al., 1997). About 20 years later,
over 650 different mutations have been reported, which are listed in a
COL3A1-specific database (see https://eds.gene.le.ac.uk/home.php?
select_db=COL3A1). In 2014, 410 different mutations were reported
from a single Medical Genetics Laboratory at the University of Washington,
USA (Pepin et al., 2014). Based on this study and the COL3A1
mutation database, the most common type of mutation is a missense
mutation substituting a bulkier amino acid for a glycine in the triplehelical
domain. The second most common type of mutations in vEDS
are COL3A1 RNA splicing mutations (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Schwarze
et al., 1997).
7.1.3. Mutations in the C-propeptide of COL3A1
Missense and nonsense mutations in the C-terminal propeptide of
type III procollagen possibly also cause vEDS, although the detailed
functional studies to prove this are still needed (Stembridge et al.,
2015). The C-propeptide is important for the assembly of the three pro-
α chains (Boudko and Engel, 2004; Bourhis et al., 2012), but knowledge
about the role of each aa in the sequence is limited and it is, therefore,
difficult to interpret the results. One of the patients in the study by
Stembridge et al. (Stembridge et al., 2015) was a female patient with a
Pro1440Leu mutation in the C-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen
(Stembridge et al., 2015). She had thin skin, easy bruisability,
mild joint laxity, periodontal disease with gum recession, and a typical
acrogeria, but no vascular or bowel ruptures by the age of 27 years. Her
father, who was mosaic for the same mutation, showed mild joint laxity
(see Section 7.1.5.). Cultured skin fibroblasts of the patient produced
less type III collagen than control fibroblasts. Protein modelling was
suggestive of leucine destabilizing the structure. Another patient was a
39-year old male with easy bruisability, hyperextensible skin, ruptured
ligament of the diaphragm, and bilateral inguinal hernia, but again no
vascular complications (Stembridge et al., 2015). Protein analysis of
cultured skin fibroblasts revealed type III collagen deficiency, and DNA
sequencing of genomic DNA revealed an Arg1432Leu missense mutation.
The patient's more mildly affected sister had the same mutation.
The third patient studied by Stembridge et al. (2015) was a 26-year old
female with a generalized joint laxity, easy bruisability, unusual facial
appearance, and a slightly enlarged pulmonary artery. DNA sequencing
found a nonsense mutation. Protein analyses demonstrated slightly reduced
amounts of type III procollagen. The fourth patient had skin and
joint manifestations, as well as a gastric paresis with atony, and was
diagnosed with the benign hypermobility or EDS type III. DNA sequencing
revealed a Lys1313Arg missense mutation, but based on
protein analyses performed on cultured skin fibroblasts the amount of
type III procollagen was normal. Protein modelling showed no adverse
consequences. The authors concluded the variant was a benign variant.
7.1.4. RNA splicing mutations in COL3A1
The most frequently seen pattern of abnormal splicing is exon
skipping, but other forms of aberrant splicing have also been detected
(Fig. 7) (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Schwarze et al., 1997). The normal
COL3A1 gene does not undergo alternative splicing. RNA splicing mutations
that lead to exon skipping, and thereby remove one entire exon,
produce a transcript that encodes a protein with multiple triplets of
amino acids deleted, since each exon in the triple-helical region starts
with a complete glycine codon. The resultant mutant protein is,
therefore, shorter by the number of amino acids encoded by that exon,
but the Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets stay in frame and there are no premature
termination codons.
In a study that described the first RNA splicing mutations in COL3A1
in 1990 (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990), three single nucleotide changes were
found, each mutating the first G in a different intron (introns 16, 20 and
42) to an A (Fig. 7). The patterns of RNA splicing were studied by S1
nuclease probe protection experiments and cDNA sequencing and were
found to differ (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Kontusaari et al., 1990a). The
intron 16 mutation led to an abnormal splicing that skipped exon 16,
whereas an identical mutation in intron 20 produced two different RNA
species, one of which was generated by an efficient use of a cryptic
splice and the other with no splicing of intron 20 and retaining the
entire intron in the resulting transcript. The third mutation located in
intron 42 led to an efficient use of a near-by cryptic splice site which
added only 30 nucleotides to the transcript and kept it in frame
(Kuivaniemi et al., 1990). The same intron 42 mutation was later found
in another unrelated patient and the splicing pattern was the same in
both patients (Schwarze et al., 1997). Interestingly, two different mutations
in the 5th nucleotide of intron 42 in two additional vEDS patients
also produced the same abnormal splicing (Giunta and
Steinmann, 2000; Okita et al., 2010) suggesting that the inclusion of 30
intronic nucleotides into the mRNA is an efficient form of splicing for
intron 42. Okita et al. (2010) showed that the mutation led to a decreased
amount of type III collagen synthesis by the patient's skin fibroblasts.
A single-base mutation in COL3A1 that changed the 5th nucleotide
of intron 37 from G to A led to abnormal RNA splicing, which produced
skipping of exon 37 (Wu et al., 1993). Quantification of the RNA splicing
patterns showed that 70% of the mutant allele was spliced through
exon skipping and 30% was spliced normally, when the skin fibroblasts
were grown at 37 °C. Interestingly, the amount of abnormal splicing
increased at a lower temperature and was approximately 90% at 31 °C.
Studies on RNA splicing defects in COL3A1 have led to a better
understanding of the mechanism of RNA splicing in large multi-exon
genes such as the collagen genes (Fig. 7). It is plausible to speculate that
the order of splicing of different introns varies and that the size of the
intron also influences the splicing pattern favoured when the normally
occurring splice site is mutated (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990; Schwarze
et al., 1997). Another factor likely to play a role is the presence of
cryptic splice sites, sequences near the normally used splice sites, which
are activated when the normal splice site becomes weaker through a
mutation (Kuivaniemi et al., 1990). The use of cryptic splice sites in an
intron leads to an incorporation of additional nucleotides into the
transcript (Fig. 7). These extra sequences usually contain premature
termination sites for translation and are detected by nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay, the result of which is the degradation of the abnormal
RNA molecules and no protein synthesis.
7.1.5. Germline and somatic cell mosaicism in the relatives of patients with
COL3A1 mutations
Germline and somatic cell mosaicism refers to a situation where a
mutation occurred during the embryogenesis of the individual and
therefore, the mutation is not present in all the cells of that individual.
Depending on the cell lineage in which the mutation occurred and the
number of cells with the mutation, the disease phenotype may or may
not manifest in that individual. It has been estimated that approximately
15% of the phenotypically normal parents of vEDS patients are
mosaic (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]). This is an important finding that
must be taken into consideration in genetic counselling, since the risk
for a mosaic parent to have another affected child is higher than that for
a genetically normal parent. Prenatal testing is available for at-risk
individuals (Byers, 1993 [updated 2019]).
Several of the COL3A1 mosaic cases have been studied in detail
(Kontusaari et al., 1992; Richards et al., 1992; Milewicz et al., 1993;
Palmeri et al., 2003; Stembridge et al., 2015). One such case was a
typical female vEDS patient with arterial ruptures, pneumothorax, easy

160
bruisability, and skin changes, who was found to have a single base
mutation leading to a Gly1018Asp change in the triple-helical domain
(Kontusaari et al., 1992). The parents had no signs of vEDS when last
examined in their 70's. When the inheritance of the mutation was investigated,
a surprising finding was that the mother also carried the
same mutation in nearly all of her blood leukocytes. Analyses of saliva
and hair samples from the mother revealed that approximately 40% of
the oral epithelial cells and 0 to 100% of the DNA from 28 hair roots
tested individually contained the single base mutation. Based on these
results, the mutation must have occurred after the first cell division of
the embryo, but before the differentiation of three major germ layers,
the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm (Kontusaari et al., 1992).
Another example of a mosaicism was in a family where the vEDS
patient had a 2-kb deletion in the COL3A1, and the patient's
phenotypically normal father also had this same deletion in some of his
cells (Milewicz et al., 1993). Approximately 80% of his cultured skin
fibroblasts, but only 20% of his blood leukocytes, carried the deletion.
The deletion was also found in his sperm cells, but due to a small
sample, quantification was not possible (Milewicz et al., 1993). The
authors interpreted the results to mean that the mutation occurred
during his embryologic development before the lineage allocation
happens.
The third example of a mosaicism was described in the unaffected
77-year old maternal grandmother of a male vEDS patient with a
Gly847Glu mutation (Richards et al., 1992). The patient had a spontaneous
carotid-cavernous sinus aneurysm and his mother died at the
age of 50 years from a bowel rupture. The patient's brother had thin
skin and joint laxity. The amount of type III collagen synthesized by the

in three different COL3A1 splicing defects (A), and
two possible splicing mechanisms (B). G-to-A mutations
in the first nucleotide of introns 16, 20 and
42 of COL3A1 led to different splicing patterns,
which were experimentally validated by S1 nuclease
probe protection experiments and cDNA sequencing.

splicing and broken lines less frequently used. The

patient, his brother and mother was reduced. Additional biochemical
work on the patient's skin fibroblasts showed that the type III collagen
was overmodified. In addition, cyanogen bromide peptide mapping
demonstrated differences from the normal pattern. A genetic test using
allele specific hybridization on genomic DNA isolated from blood demonstrated
that all three affected family members and the maternal
grandmother were positive for the missense mutation. The findings on
the grandmother were confirmed with a second blood sample and hair
samples. Quantification of the amount of the mutant-to-normal allele
ratio was approximately 0.5 suggesting that about 2/3 of the grandmother's
cells carried the mutant allele.
The fourth example of a mosaicism was reported in a study on a
family in which the index patient and her mother had neurological
manifestations with leg and hand contractures, epilepsy and stroke in
addition to acrogeria and coiled cerebral vessels and dissections
(Palmeri et al., 2003). They harboured a missense mutation at aa 883
that converted a glycine to a valine. The asymptomatic maternal
grandmother with a slight ectasia of thoracic aorta was found to be a
mosaic for the same mutation.
The fifth example of a mosaicism was described in the father of a
female patient with a Pro1440Leu mutation in the C-terminal propeptide
of type III procollagen (Stembridge et al., 2015). The father showed
mild joint laxity, whereas the patient had thin skin, easy bruisability,
mild joint laxity, periodontal disease with gum recession, and a typical
acrogeria, but no vascular or bowel ruptures by the age of 27 years.
7.1.6. Biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations
The biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations have
been investigated extensively using cultured skin fibroblasts established
from skin biopsies (Tromp et al., 1989b; Kontusaari et al., 1990b;
Kontusaari et al., 1992; Richards et al., 1992; Narcisi et al., 1993;
Anderson et al., 1997; Okita et al., 2010). This is an ideal system to
study the consequences of the mutations, since skin biopsies are easy to
obtain and type III procollagen is expressed in these cells (see Section
7.1.1. for details).
Most patients are heterozygous for the mutation and therefore,
produce both normal and abnormal α chains of the type III procollagen.
Since three α chains are required to form a triple-helical structure, there
can be normal and mutant homotrimers, but also trimers that have
either one or two mutant α chains together with two or one normal α
chains. Altogether only one-eighth of the trimers are completely normal
and only one-eighth of the trimers are completely abnormal. For
structural stability, the heterotrimers with both normal and mutant α
chains folded together are the most problematic ones with aberrant
fibril formation leading to reduced strength.
It is also possible to carry out ultrastructural analyses of skin samples
taken from the patient and use light and electron microscopy for
the analysis. These studies have demonstrated a dilated rough endoplasmic
reticulum and changes in the diameter of collagen fibers
(Nuytinck et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1997).
More recent studies have used microarray-based transcriptomics to
determine which biological pathways are affected by COL3A1 mutations
in cultured skin fibroblasts (Chiarelli et al., 2018). Expression
profiles of skin cells from two patients who were each heterozygous for
the missense mutations, Gly237Arg and Gly612Asp, and a third patient
with an RNA slicing mutation in intron 14 were compared to expression
profiles of nine healthy age-matched controls (Chiarelli et al., 2018).
Altogether 969 genes were differentially expressed, 281 with increased
and 688 with decreased expression, between the vEDS and control
groups. Fibrillin-2 (FBN2) was the most differentially expressed gene
with decreased expression. Several of the genes with increased expression
in the patient cells were involved in transcriptional regulation
and re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The genes with decreased
expression belonged to such functional categories as cell cycle processes,
cell division, histones, cell movement and intracellular trafficking,
DNA damage response, and ribosomal RNA processing. A
pathway enrichment analysis revealed that cell cycle was the most affected
pathway. The proteasome system was also affected by having
several of the differentially expressed genes.
7.1.7. Genotype-phenotype correlations among vEDS patients
In a series of 1231 vEDS cases from a single laboratory, 630 index
cases and their 601 affected relatives were analysed for clinical features
and COL3A1 defects (Pepin et al., 2014). The median survival age
among men and women was 46 and 54 years, respectively. The causes
of deaths included vascular complications such as rupture and dissection,
and bowel perforations.
In this study, a total of 410 different COL3A1 mutations deemed to
be causative were found among the 572 index cases (Pepin et al., 2014).
Biochemical analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts had been carried out in
the remaining 58 index cases before genetic testing was available and
found to produce abnormal type III procollagen. The 410 different
mutations included 356 glycine substitutions, 164 RNA splicing mutations
and 52 other types of mutations (insertions, duplications or deletions).
In 27 vEDS patients the mutated allele led to an unstable RNA
through nonsense-mediated decay, and did not produce protein (null
mutations or haploinsufficiency).
Survival of vEDS patients with null mutations was 10–15 years
longer than in individuals harbouring RNA splicing or glycine mutations
(Pepin et al., 2014). Interestingly, survival among the patients
with glycine mutations differed based on the substituting amino acid; a
substitution of a valine or an aspartic acid meant worse survival than a
substitution of a serine (Pepin et al., 2014).
In another smaller series from France, 215 vEDS patients from 146
different families and with 126 different variants were investigated
(Frank et al., 2015). The overall findings were similar to those from the
larger series described above in that patients with glycine substitutions
(n=127) had poorer prognosis than patients with mutations leading to
haploinsufficiency (n=14) (Frank et al., 2015). There was, however,
no difference between male and female vEDS patients in the age when a
major clinical complication occurred. Interestingly, in this series the
vEDS patients with RNA splicing defects had earlier age at diagnosis
than patients with glycine substitutions (Frank et al., 2015). The authors
speculated that this could be due to differences in the clinical
practices between France and the USA.
7.2. Genetic studies for other human diseases
7.2.1. COL3A1 mutations in patients with brain disorders
Several patients with severe brain anomalies in addition to connective
tissue manifestations have been reported to harbour a pathogenic
variant in both COL3A1 alleles (Plancke et al., 2009; Jorgensen
et al., 2015; Horn et al., 2017; Vandervore et al., 2017). In human
genetics this is known as a compound heterozygosity, but they are now
called “biallelic variants” in the literature. Interestingly, the results
from imaging and histological analyses of the brain in the affected individuals
resemble those seen in patients with bilateral frontoparietal
polymicrogyria (OMIM 606854), who have mutations in GRP56 (Ke
et al., 2008). Since type III collagen is a ligand for GRP56, it is plausible
that those mutations in COL3A1 that interfere with the receptor-ligand
interaction or eliminate type III collagen altogether, manifest as this
neurological phenotype. It is also noteworthy, that the Col3a1+/− mice
manifest similar brain phenotype (see Section 8.1). One of these patients
had an Arg428Stop nonsense mutation in the paternal and a
deletion of one C in Pro686 leading to premature termination in the
maternal allele of COL3A1. As a consequence, the patient had no
functional type III collagen, and would be expected to have a very severe
phenotype. Each parent was heterozygous for one of these variants
and showed no clinical phenotype (Horn et al., 2017). Four other patients,
a sister and a brother, and two unrelated patients with delayed
speech and motor development and frontoparietal polymicrogyria were
reported to be homozygous for the same Pro49Ala variant (Horn et al.,

2017; Vandervore et al., 2017). Even though the variant was classified
as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on in silico scoring algorithms,
and it is intriguing that it was present in four patients, it is difficult to be
certain that it is the cause of the disease, since biological functional
studies did not yield any significant findings (Vandervore et al., 2017).
In another study by Jorgensen et al. (2015), two siblings were compound
heterozygotes for a mutation causing a premature termination at
aa 596 and a missense mutation in the C-terminal propeptide that
changed a glycine to a glutamic acid. One of these patients died suddenly
at the age of 15 of arterial dissections at three different sites, and
the other had a dissection in the internal carotid artery and cerebral
cortical dysplasia (micropolygyria). The four family members who were
heterozygous for the premature termination mutation had no clinical
manifestations, whereas the one family member who was heterozygous
for the missense mutation had thin, translucent skin, small joint hypermobility,
pulmonary emphysema and reduced aortic elasticity,
which are typical signs of vEDS (Jorgensen et al., 2015).
7.2.2. Studies for other human diseases using COL3A1 genetic variants
Since type III collagen is such an important structural component for
the integrity of blood vessels, several studies have investigated the
possibility that genetic variants in the COL3A1 gene increase the person's
risk for developing aneurysms. Despite of few isolated reports with
positive findings (Kontusaari et al., 1990b; Anderson et al., 1996; van
Keulen et al., 1999), larger studies using a comprehensive DNA sequencing
analysis of the entire triple-helical domain of type III procollagen
in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (Tromp et al.,
1993) and intracranial aneurysms (Kuivaniemi et al., 1993) found no
mutations that could explain the disease. Subsequently, an approach
called genetic association study (Romero et al., 2002) in which the
frequencies of the two alleles of COL3A1 polymorphisms were compared
in cases and controls, was used. No association was found between
aneurysms and the COL3A1 polymorphisms (Ogata et al., 2005;
Hinterseher et al., 2011). Furthermore, family-based DNA linkage studies
(Shibamura et al., 2004; Tromp et al., 2014) and genome-wide
association studies (Tromp et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2017) for abdominal
aortic aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms with large
sample sets have found no evidence that COL3A1 variants contribute to
the susceptibility of these conditions. Unlike the candidate gene approaches
which rely on prior knowledge about the pathobiology of the
disease and are based on educated guesses, these genome-wide approaches
are unbiased and decipher the entire human genome to find
statistical evidence for a linkage or an association. It should be noted
that such studies require large sample sets with thousands of cases and
controls to obtain reliable estimates of the disease risk (Romero et al.,
2002).
COL3A1 has been tested as a potential susceptibility gene for several
other clinical conditions (Muckian et al., 2002; Lv et al., 2014; Reichert
et al., 2018). One recent study investigated two COL3A1 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3134646 and rs1800225, among 422
patients with diverticulosis and 285 controls (Reichert et al., 2018). The
rs3134646 was associated with diverticulosis, but rs1800225 not, with
an odds ratio of 1.82 (95% confidence interval of 1.04–3.20) and
p=0.04. Due to the small sample size and only borderline significance,
the results will need validation and replication.
In another genetic association study, three COL3A1 SNPs
(rs2138533, rs11887092, and rs1800255) were analysed for their
contribution to the recurrence and prognosis of stroke in the Chinese
population (Lv et al., 2014). A total of 1544 stroke patients from three
different subtypes of stroke were included in the study and followed up
for 4.5 years. All three variants were associated with the risk for stroke
recurrence and prognosis independently from conventional risk factors.
Patients who had the A allele of rs1800255, had a lower risk for reoccurrence
of stroke, but an increased risk for all-cause mortality in the
atherothrombotic stroke subgroup. Again, due to the small sample size,
the results although statistically significant, can only be considered
suggestive and need further validation.
Muckian et al. (2002) assessed the role of genetic variability in
COL3A1 in coronary artery disease using a highly polymorphic intronic
tandem repeat as a marker. This repeat is located in intron 25 and has
between three and 13 copies of a 15-bp repeat (Mays et al., 1992). Four
of the alleles are common and were used in the study. The rationale for
selecting COL3A1 as the candidate gene for the study, was that it is
expressed in vascular wall and is known to interact with platelets. They
genotyped DNA samples obtained from individuals who were part of
three different cardiovascular studies and had a total of 1851 cases with
either acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction, unstable
coronary syndrome, or stable angina, in addition to 306 controls. The
authors concluded that COL3A1 variants modulate the risk for coronary
artery disease. As with all small human genetic studies, the results require
confirmation in an independent data set. Furthermore, in complex
phenotypes such as the coronary artery disease, the contribution of any
single genetic variant is expected to be small and explain only a small
fraction of the increased or decreased risk.
7.3. Altered COL3A1 mRNA and protein levels, or degradation in human
diseases
Accumulation of type III collagen is a hallmark of several chronic
human diseases that involve fibrotic processes including systemic
sclerosis, cardiac fibrosis, lung fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and renal fibrosis
(Table 2) (Jimenez et al., 1986; Krieg et al., 1986; Rosenbloom et al.,
2016; Fogo et al., 2017; Karsdal et al., 2017; Ricard-Blum et al., 2018).
Thus, a large number of studies have investigated the potential of using
the determination of the PIIINP levels (Risteli et al., 1988) in the urine
and serum as a biomarker for the presence of fibrosis. The N-terminal
propeptide is cleaved off enzymatically during the biosynthesis of type
III collagen (Fig. 3) and it has been proposed that its levels are a surrogate
marker for the amount of type III collagen in a given tissue.
Another serum test (C3M), developed more recently, measures the levels
of a 10-aa neoepitope of type III collagen generated by digestion
with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Barascuk et al., 2010). This test does
not recognize intact type III collagen, but is specific for the short peptide,
and can thus be used to measure type III collagen degradation. A
third test (C3C) was developed to measure fragments of type III collagen
generated by cathepsins B, L, S and K by ELISA and was tested in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
(Rasmussen et al., 2017). This test recognizes a neoepitope located in aa
642–651 of the α-chain of type III collagen. COPD patients (n=68) had
significantly elevated levels of C3C in their serum compared to healthy
controls (n=20). Serum tests of these three assays and any new tests to
be developed would provide an important clinical advancement for
diagnostics and monitoring treatment responses since they are minimally
invasive tests.
7.3.1. Cardiac diseases
The role of extracellular matrix proteins in the pathophysiology of
some of the major cardiovascular diseases has been studied extensively
(Prabhu and Frangogiannis, 2016; Frangogiannis, 2017). Extracellular
matrix accumulation in the heart tissue leads to cardiac fibrosis, scarring
that results from an injury, such as a myocardial infarction, and
leads to impaired function of the heart muscle (Krenning et al., 2010).
Many studies, however, do not distinguish what collagen type was
studied and just refer to collagen. Studies that have investigated type III
collagen specifically include those on the hypertrophic (Hayashi et al.,
1998; Kitamura et al., 2001) and dilated cardiomyopathy
(Marijianowski et al., 1995; Hayashi et al., 1998; Bonapace et al., 2006;
Herpel et al., 2006; Sivakumar et al., 2008), as well as pulmonary
vascular disease (Frangogiannis, 2017), and replacement fibrosis following
myocardial infarction (Herpel et al., 2006; Prabhu and
Frangogiannis, 2016). Type III collagen changes have also been studied
in a rare cardiomyopathy called idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
164
(Hayashi et al., 1998).
Marijianowski et al. (1995) studied the amount and distribution of
type I and III collagen in heart tissue samples obtained from patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy (n=19) and age-matched controls
(n=17) who died of non-cardiovascular diseases (Marijianowski et al.,
1995). Using biochemical and histological methods, they found that
both collagen types were increased in the diseased heart tissues, but the
increase was more pronounced in type I collagen and therefore the type
I-to-III –ratio increased. The authors speculated that this finding could
be clinically relevant and explain part of the disease characteristics,
since type III collagen gives more elastic properties to the tissue and
type I collagen is more rigid. The findings of increased type III collagen
levels being associated with dilated cardiomyopathy have subsequently
been validated in other studies (Hayashi et al., 1998; Sivakumar et al.,
2008).
Herpel et al. (2006) investigated several extracellular matrix proteins
in heart tissue samples obtained from patients diagnosed with
dilated (n=15), ischemic (n=17) and valvular cardiomyopathy
(n=7) using immunostaining (Herpel et al., 2006). They showed that
the different types of cardiomyopathies all had myocardial interstial
fibrosis, but that they differed in the distribution of various extracellular
matrix proteins. The amount of type III collagen was the
greatest in samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and
lowest in those from patients with valvular disease. Bonapace et al.
(2006) studied aortic stiffness in 89 patients diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy and found that serum PIIINP levels were correlated
with clinical parameters measuring aortic stiffness (Bonapace et al.,
2006).
Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare disease manifesting
as a diastolic dysfunction. Histologically the disease is characterized by
fibrosis in the heart tissue and hypertrophy of myocytes making the
heart tissue stiff. Hayashi et al. (1998) carried out a histological analysis
of endomyocardial biopsy samples (n=7) from these patients and
compared the findings to those from patients diagnosed with coronary
artery disease (n=5), hypertrophic cardiopathy (n=11) and dilated
cardiomyopathy (n=14). The results revealed a marked increase in the
amount of type III collagen deposited in the myocardial interstitium.
Kitamura et al. (2001) analysed histologically 35 heart tissue specimens
from 35 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Kitamura
et al., 2001). The amount of type III collagen protein detected in immunostaining
correlated with several cardiac metrics measuring diastolic
function and demonstrated that increased amount of fibrosis was
associated with poorer cardiac function. Interestingly, the amount of
type I collagen did not correlate with these metrics.
Thiele et al. (2004) found that the mRNA levels of hnRNP E1, K and
A1 were elevated in heart tissue samples from patients diagnosed with
aortic stenosis (n=18), and E1 and K were elevated in patients with
ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=6), compared to control heart tissue
samples (n=20) taken from hearts harvested for transplantation. As
described in Section 6, A1 and K bind to sequences in the 3′UTR of
COL3A1 mRNA to stabilize the transcript.
PIIINP has been tested as a potential marker for heart disease, but
the results have been contradictory. In a large community-based study
of 967 well-characterized participants, no correlation was found between
serum PIIINP levels and various cardiovascular risk factors such
as hypertension or diabetes (Wang et al., 2007). There was also no
correlation between echocardiographically-determined left ventricular
or atrial mass and PIIINP levels (Wang et al., 2007). Manhenke et al.
(2014) measured several biomarkers, including PIIINP, in serum samples
from 233 patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction within
the past three days (Manhenke et al., 2014). The patients were then
followed up for two years. Several of the other biomarkers including
type I collagen markers, but not PIIINP, changed during the follow-up
that included treatment with either losartan or captopril. In this study
PIIINP showed no prognostic value. The same authors (Manhenke et al.,
2014) analysed 42 patients with first-time myocardial infarction that
produced ST-elevation in an electrocardiogram. The patients underwent
percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. In
agreement with their earlier study, PIIINP levels stayed within normal
limits during the entire time. There was, however, an increase in PIIINP
levels during the first two days after the infarction, but the levels did
not exceed the normal limits.
In 2012, Fertin et al. (2012) carried out a systematic review on 59
published studies (Fertin et al., 2012) investigating the usefulness of
biomarkers predicting which myocardial infarction patients develop
left ventricular remodeling that leads to heart failure. PIIINP was one of
the biomarkers studied, but it was measured in only three studies for a
total of 210 patients. In all three studies the serum PIIINP levels were
correlated with left ventricular remodeling.
7.3.2. Other diseases
The histological hallmarks of chronic renal failure are glomerulosclerosis
and tubulointerstial fibrosis due to the accumulation of connective
tissue proteins (Soylemezoglu et al., 1997). Based on histological
analyses tubular epithelial cells in patients with diabetic
nephropathy synthesize increased amounts of type III collagen
(Razzaque et al., 1995). Individual studies on renal fibrosis have concluded
that PIIINP levels in the urine and serum correlate with the
amount of fibrosis present in the kidneys (Soylemezoglu et al., 1997). A
recent systematic review (Mansour et al., 2017) that included only
studies in which renal biopsy was used to verify the kidney disease,
however, concluded that PIIINP levels were not independently associated
with a chronic kidney disease after adjusting for proteinuria. In
another community-based study of 958 individuals ≥65 years, urine
PIIINP levels were found to increase with the progression of the kidney
disease and higher PIIINP levels were also associated with death (Ix
et al., 2015).
For liver diseases, PIIINP assay is part of the “Enhanced Liver
Fibrosis” (ELF) panel, which includes assays for three molecules: hyaluronic
acid, PIIINP, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1
(Tanwar et al., 2017). The ELF panel has been used as a surrogate
marker of liver fibrosis allowing a minimally invasive blood sampling
method to be used instead of obtaining a liver biopsy (Tanwar et al.,
2017). ELF score and PIIINP levels were also shown to be correlated
with skin and lung fibrosis in patients with systemic sclerosis (Abignano
et al., 2019).
Collagen accumulation and metabolism has also been studied extensively
in fibrotic lung diseases. For example, Kirk et al. (1984) carried
out a study on patients diagnosed with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.
They showed that the serum PIIINP concentrations were
increased in these patients compared to normal controls or patients
with non-fibrotic lung diseases. With biochemical analyses of lung
tissue samples they were able to demonstrate that the serum PIIINP
levels correlated with the type III to type I collagen ratios in the lung.
Interestingly, those patients with the highest serum PIIINP levels before
the treatment had the best response to treatment measured by improvements
in lung function tests forced vital capacity and transfer
coefficient values.
Another disease with type III collagen accumulation is Dupuytren's
disease, in which type III collagen is present in increased amounts in the
aponeurosis (Menzel et al., 1979; Somers et al., 1989). Collagen III
accumulation has been seen in yet another fibrotic condition called
Peyronie's disease, in which scar tissue forms in the tunica albuginea of
the penis as a result of currently unknown mechanism and leads to a
severely impaired function (Somers et al., 1989).
Elevated levels of type III collagen have also been seen in patients
with Crohn's disease. One study showed increased amounts of type III
collagen in fibroblast cultures originating from patients' intestine
(Stallmach et al., 1992). In another study C3M levels were higher in
serum samples from patients with the penetrating form of Crohn's disease
indicating increased breakdown of type III collagen by matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (van Haaften et al., 2017). The best marker to
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
165
differentiate between the different subtypes of Crohn's disease was the
ratio of type III collagen to C3M, reflecting an imbalance between the
synthesis and the breakdown of type III collagen. Another study was
able to differentiate between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using
serum biomarkers including the C3M assay (Mortensen et al., 2015).
Type III collagen expression has also been studied in non-fibrotic
diseases. In a study that investigated 33 patients with hyperthyroidism,
the serum levels of PIIINP were found to be elevated compared to 26
controls (Inui et al., 1992). The authors pointed out that the liver
function of these patients was normal.
Aigner et al. (1993) had an unexpected finding in that type III
collagen was present in dedifferentiated chondrocytes in cartilage
samples taken from patients with late stage osteoarthritis, when the
well-established expression profile of chondrocytes includes type II, IX
and XI collagens, but no type III collagen. In this study immunostaining
was used to investigate protein expression and in situ RNA hybridization
to determine the location and extent of mRNA expression. Interestingly,
these cells also expressed type II collagen, but no type I collagen.
Normal chondrocytes did not express any type III collagen (Aigner
et al., 1993). Another group, however, detected type III collagen even in
normal human articular cartilage specimens taken from individuals
between ages 17 and 81 years (Wotton and Duance, 1994).
Type III collagen expression has also been evaluated in cancer. In
one study where 33 glioma tissues samples were analysed, a significant
increase in COL3A1 mRNA levels was found and the increased expression
correlated with the tumor grade with high grade gliomas showing
the highest levels of expression (Gao et al., 2018). Immunohistological
staining of glioma tissues demonstrated the same results on the protein
level. In follow-up studies in which COL3A1 expression in a cell culture
system was silenced by siRNA, the proliferation and migration of
glioma cells was suppressed.
In another cancer study, overexpression of COL3A1 was found to be
associated with a poor prognosis of bladder cancer (Yuan et al., 2017).
Similarly, increased levels of PIIINP were associated with a poor
prognosis and a shorter overall survival of breast cancer patients
(Lipton et al., 2018).
8. Col3a1 mutant mice
Currently there are four different Col3a1 mouse models (Liu et al.,
1997; Smith et al., 2011; Long et al., 2015; D'Hondt et al., 2018). As can
be seen in Table 3, which summarizes the characteristics of these
models, none of them are ideal models of the human vEDS. They have,
however, become useful models for studying the function of type III
collagen in various tissues and organs.
8.1. Inactivation by knockout of the murine Col3a1 gene
Inactivation of the murine Col3a1 gene was carried out by homologous
recombination in embryonic stem cells using a targeting vector
in which the Col3a1 promoter and the first exon were deleted and replaced
by the neomycin gene (Liu et al., 1997). Approximately 95% of
the homozygous mutant mice died early on, with most deaths occurring
in the first two days after birth, but heterozygous mice appeared phenotypically
normal (Liu et al., 1997). The homozygous mice that survived
were smaller than their wild-type littermates, and they died at the
age of about 6 months from a rupture of major arteries or the bowel,
mimicking the human vEDS phenotype. These mice also had skin lesions,
such as open wounds. Histological analysis using light microscopy
did not reveal any obvious abnormalities in the analysed tissues.
Electron microscopy, however, demonstrated abnormal collagen fibers
in the skin, aorta, liver, lung, heart and bowel (Liu et al., 1997). These
studies provided important information to our basic understanding of
the fibrillogenesis of collagen by demonstrating that lack of type III
collagen led to disorganized type I collagen fibrils with variable diameters
(Liu et al., 1997). Type III collagen thus appears to regulate the

type I collagen fibril formation.
The homozygous Col3a1−/− mice were also studied for potential
brain defects, since COL3A1 is a ligand for GPR56, which harbors
mutations in patients with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, a
severe brain malformation (Jeong et al., 2012). In histological analyses
all Col3a1−/− mice showed a severe malformation of the brain cortex
at E18.5. The defects were described as cobblestone like cortical malformations
and included pial breakdown in the basement membrane,
neuronal overmigration, radial glial detachment, and formation of
marginal zone heterotopias. None of the heterozygous Col3a1+/− or
wildtype mice had these malformations. Based on these findings, type
III collagen appears to be important for brain development.
The heterozygous mutant mice of the same Col3a1 knock-out mouse
model were studied further by Cooper et al. (2010). Less collagen and
reduced amounts of Col3a1 mRNA were found in the abdominal aorta
and the wall strength was reduced. Similarly, the bowel walls from
these mice showed increased compliance and decreased strength, which
was tested by applying pressure and determining when the bowel wall
burst. Histological lesions found in the internal elastic lamina of the
aortae were more severe in older mice and more common in male mice
(Cooper et al., 2010). In conclusion, the heterozygous mice lack the
clinical features of vEDS, but do display several histological signs of
Col3a1 deficiency. A 9-month doxycycline treatment of heterozygous
(Col3a1+/−) mice reduced the number of histological lesions in the
aorta (Tae et al., 2012). This was most likely due to a decrease in Mmp9
expression, since doxycycline is a known inhibitor of MMPs.
The Col3a1 knock-out mouse model has been studied for many
different organ systems and biological processes including the bladder
function and healing of bone fractures. The amount of type III collagen
was reduced and the collagen fiber diameter more varied in the bladder
tissues of Col3a1+/−mice compared to wild-type mice (Stevenson et al.,
2006). In functional tests using bladder muscle strips removed from the
mice, the muscle removed from heterozygous mice generated less tension
and were more compliant suggesting that there is a critical level of
type III collagen required for normal bladder function.
A detailed analysis of the skeletons of the wild-type, Col3a1+/− and
Col3a1−/− mice at age 6–8 weeks was carried out using microcomputer
tomography (Volk et al., 2014). The results demonstrated a reduction in
several bone phenotypes including the bone volume, bone volume
fraction, connectivity density, structure model index and trabecular
thickness in the Col3a1+/− compared to the wild-type mice. In cell
culture experiments, mesenchymal progenitor cells isolated from the
Col3a1−/− mice had decreased activity of alkaline phosphatase and
impaired mineralization. The authors concluded that these findings
implied that type III collagen is involved in the formation of the trabecular
bone. Furthermore, using a bilateral tibial fracture model in the
heterozygous (Col3a1+/−) mice reduced levels of Col3a1 were shown
to impair the bone formation and alter remodeling during the healing of
the fractures (Miedel et al., 2015). Based on immunofluorescent
staining, fracture callus contained considerable amounts of type III
collagen, whereas very little or no type III collagen was detected in the
uninjured cortical bone.
8.2. A large deletion of the murine Col3a1 gene
Another mouse model with a large 185-kb deletion encompassing
the promoter region and the first 39 exons of the Col3a1 gene was first
discovered by its phenotype of sudden deaths due to thoracic aortic
dissections (Smith et al., 2011). The underlying genetic defect in these
mice was detected by genetic mapping and DNA sequencing. In followup
studies investigating 225 mice heterozygous for the deletion, aortic
dissection was seen in 28% and it was twice as common in male as
female mice. No skin or bowel problems were detected in any of the
mice. Mice homozygous for the deletion appeared to die before birth,
since no homozygous mice were found. Histological analyses of the
aortic wall showed reduced amounts of collagen in the media, but not
in the adventitia layer. Transmission electron microscopy images demonstrated
abnormal collagen fibers (Smith et al., 2011).
8.3. Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of Col3a1
The third currently available mouse model includes transgenic mice
overexpressing Col3a1 with a Gly182Ser mutation (D'Hondt et al.,
2018). A control transgenic mouse line overexpressing the normal
Col3a1 was also produced. The mice with the Gly182Ser transgene
developed severe skin wounds, demonstrated vascular fragility in the
form of reduced tensile strength and died prematurely at the age of
13–14 weeks (D'Hondt et al., 2018). Both skin and aorta contained
abnormal collagen fibrils, and there was less type III collagen in the
aortic wall (D'Hondt et al., 2018). The collagen type III:I ratio in the
skin changed from 0.5 in the non-transgenic mice to 1.0 in the transgenic
mice overexpressing normal Col3a1, to 0.3 in the transgenic mice
with the Gly182Ser mutation. There were no differences in the extent of
post-translational modifications or the thermal stability of the collagens
produced between the two transgenic mouse lines (D'Hondt et al.,
2018). The diameter of collagen fibers was more variable and the fibers
were generally thicker in the Gly182Ser transgenic mice than in the
other mouse lines.
8.4. Tsk2/+ mice with a missense mutation
The tight skin (Tsk2/+) mice resemble the human disease systemic
sclerosis. They were identified in a screening after mutagenic agent
ethylnitrosurea was used to generate mutations in the mouse genome
(Long et al., 2015). The defect was genetically mapped to mouse
chromosome 1, which harbors Col3a1. Sequencing of RNA and genomic
DNA identified a total of 265 sequence variants in both wild-type and
Tsk2/+ mice and they were thus excluded from further analyses.
Thirteen sequence variants were found in all four Tsk2/+ mice, but ten
of them were also found in another strain of mice and were excluded. Of
the remaining three sequence variants present only in the Tsk2/+
mice, two were in introns, and one was a missense variant in Col3a1
that converted a cysteine to a serine in the N-terminal propeptide. This
Cys-to-Ser change mutates one of the cysteine residues that are normally
part of intrachain disulphide bonds. Based on the RNA-sequencing
data, Col3a1 had the highest number of reads from the genes located
in the candidate interval, indicating that its expression was
increased, which is in agreement with previous biochemical studies.
Complementation experiments were carried out in which the Tsk2/+
mice were crossed with Col3a1−/+ mice to prove that the sequence
variant found in Col3a1 is Tsk2. The result showed that the Tsk2 gene
was not able to rescue the Col3a1-knockout phenotype.
9. Conclusions
Nearly 50 years of research into the structure and function of type
III collagen has demonstrated that it is an essential structural component
of blood vessels, uterus and bowel. Without type III collagen mice
die in utero and with mutated forms of it humans develop serious
clinical manifestations leading to a premature death due to a spontaneous
rupture of an artery, bowel or uterus. Furthermore, some
COL3A1 mutations lead to a severe brain abnormality and developmental
delay. Increased amounts of type III collagen are found in many
acquired human fibrotic diseases such as kidney and liver fibrosis, and
systemic sclerosis. Type III collagen is known to interact with type I and
II collagens in the fibril formation and is an important regulator of fibril
diameter; increase in type III collagen content will lead to the formation
of thinner fibrils. Type III collagen is also a critical component in platelet
aggregation and thus initiating the blood clotting cascade.
There are still several unanswered questions about the function of
type III collagen, e.g., what are the molecules it interacts with, is it
possible to create a computational model that predicts the effects of a
H. Kuivaniemi and G. Tromp Gene 707 (2019) 151–171
167
COL3A1 mutation accurately, and how do we prevent overexpression of
type III collagen and fibrotic processes. It is also not clear why some
COL3A1 mutations lead to vEDS, whereas others manifest as a severe
brain abnormality. The classic vEDS manifests as an autosomal dominant
disease, but in the case of the brain abnormality, all reported cases
have had two mutant COL3A1 alleles suggesting an autosomal recessive
inheritance pattern. To facilitate answering these important research
questions with implications to human health, additional animal models
are required.
