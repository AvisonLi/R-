Abstract
The dominant spatial econometric model in spatial econometrics is the parametric form,
while in the realistic context, the variables often do not satisfy the assumption of linearity
and have nonlinear relationships with each other. In this paper, we introduce nonparametric
terms into spatial econometric models and propose the MCMCINLA estimation method for
varying coefficient spatial lag models. The empirical analysis is conducted with the socioeconomic
data of mainland China from 2015 to 2020 to discuss the influencing factors and
spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of China’s economic development under the
classical spatial lag model and the varying coefficient spatial lag model with population
aging as a special covariate, respectively. The results show that with the gradual aging of
the population, foreign trade will inhibit the development of regional economy to a certain
extent, while urbanization process, resident income, real estate development and high-tech
development will have a driving effect on economic growth, and high-tech development has
the strongest mobilization on regional economic development. Compared with the classical
spatial lag model, the varying coefficient spatial lag model can more fully exploit the information
of variables in a more realistic context and derive the variable evolution process.
1. Introduction
In many fields such as ecology, epidemiology and economics, the observations obtained often
have certain geospatial characteristics, and the models established often have both spatial correlation
and spatial heterogeneity, when the traditional econometric methods are no longer
applicable because they cannot distinguish between spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity,
and spatial econometrics comes into being. In recent years, the spatial element has received
increasing attention in the empirical evidence of economics, and spatial econometric models
have become a standard analytical tool for spatial data and have been widely used in regional
economics [1], ecology [2], and sociology [3].
The classical spatial econometric models mainly make linear assumptions and model spatial
correlation or spatial spillover effects, while in the real context there is not necessarily a linear

relationship between variables, but more often nonlinear characteristics [4]. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce nonparametric terms into the spatial econometric models.
The spatial varying coefficient model is a generalization of the regression model, which was
first given by Brunsdon et al. (1996) [5], and proposed a nonparametric smooth estimation
method with the distance function between the observation points as the weight—Geographically
weighted regression (GWR) method. He introduced the spatial properties of the data into
the regression coefficients, assuming that the regression coefficients are a function of the spatial
coordinates of each observation point, and explored and analyzed the spatial non-stationarity
of the regression relationship by estimating the value of the coefficient function at each
position. Fotheringham et al. (2002) [6] systematically summarized the principle and statistical
inference of GWR method for the first time, and discussed the application of GWR in generalized
linear models. In addition, the development of GWR further expands the related research
on nonparametric spatial econometric models. For instance, Cho et al. (2010) [7] proposed a
GWR-SLM varying coefficient model that combines GWR with spatial lag model; Basile et al.
(2014) [8] considered the existence of spatial correlation, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinearity
simultaneously, and obtained a new penalized spline spatial lag geo-additive model
(PS-SLM); Geniaux et al. (2018) [9] presented a new hybrid spatial geo-weighted lag model
(M-GWR-SLM) which allows regression parameters and spatial dependencies to vary over
space. With the gradual development of spatial statistics and Bayesian statistics, the spatially
varying coefficient Bayesian hierarchical model has become an effective alternative to GWR
and has been favored. Gelfand et al. (2003) [10] focused around spatially varying coefficient
Bayesian hierarchical models and provided extensions to generalized linear models and spatial-
temporal settings; Bakar et al. (2016) [11] developed an R package, spTDyn, for modeling
spatially varying coefficients and temporal dynamic processes in Bayesian hierarchical models;
Kroc (2017) [12] explored the habitat behavior characteristics of moose with the help of a spatially
varying coefficient Bayesian hierarchical model.
Due to the existence of spatial coordinates, the models discussed above can easily obtain the
variation characteristics of the response variable with the spatial location, but it is not easy to
obtain the dynamic variation law of the response variable with a covariate. In order to deeply
explore the regression relationship between variables, this paper focuses on such models in
which the coefficient function is an unknown function of a covariate, that is, by constructing a
varying coefficient spatial lag model for research and analysis. The model has the advantages
of high flexibility and strong adaptability, it can effectively avoid the problem of the curse of
dimensionality, and can obtain the dynamic change characteristics of the response variable
and other covariates under the time lapse of a covariate, which is especially suitable for use in
longitudinal data analysis.
Spatial lag model is the most widely used type of spatial econometric model. It is used to
embody spatial autocorrelation and can reflect the impact of neighboring regions on the
region. Currently, estimation on nonparametric spatial lag models is flourishing, and various
estimation methods have been proposed successively. Su and Jin (2010) [13] estimated the
parametric and nonparametric components of a semiparametric spatial lag model using Local
Linear and Cross-Sectional Likelihood methods, respectively. Li and Chen (2013) [14] proposed
a new class of semiparametric varying coefficient spatial lag models by setting the coefficients
of the explanatory variables in the form of unknown functions of certain variables and
estimated the model parameters with the help of Contour Maximum Likelihood. Fang and
Qian (2013) [15] estimated the nonparametric spatial lag model by using inverse jump
MCMC. Chen et al. (2015, 2016) [16, 17] successively proposed Two-Stage Least Squares estimation
and General Moment estimation for semiparametric panel spatial lag models. Krisztin
(2017) [18] combined penalized splines with Bayesian methods to propose a new Bayesian

semiparametric estimation method for semiparametric spatial lag models. Li and Chen (2018)
[19] constructed a nonparametric spatial lag model with random independent variables and
gave a General Moment estimation for this model. Zhao and Pu (2021) [20] proposed a new
spatial lag single indicator varying coefficient model and completed the nonparametric estimation
process by combining spline and Maximum Likelihood.
Bayesian estimation plays an increasingly important role in the statistical inference of spatial
econometric models, as the next major parameter estimation method after Maximum Likelihood
estimation and Moment estimation. Compared with Maximum Likelihood estimation
and Moment estimation, Bayesian estimation is more adaptable to data. Maximum Likelihood
estimation finds parameters by maximizing the likelihood function, which is more dependent
on the data. When the amount of data is large, the Maximum Likelihood can estimate the
parameters well; while when the amount of data is small, the Maximum Likelihood estimation
result may not be ideal. Bayesian estimation uses probability to describe the change of
unknown parameters. It regards the parameter as a random variable. By introducing a priori
to estimate the parameter, a good estimation effect can still be obtained in the case of a small
amount of data [21].
For Bayesian statistics, although it can better complete the parameter estimation in the case
of small amount of data, it also has the problem of complex calculation process, especially the
inference and calculation of the marginal posterior distribution of unknown parameters has
always been a major difficulty in Bayesian statistics. In the early 1990s, Robert et al. [22] made
a major breakthrough in Bayesian inference by applying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) method through inference simulation. MCMC can solve sampling difficulties such
as high-dimensional integration, but may be limited by convergence speed and numerical stability
when facing large models or large amounts of data. To address this problem, Rue et al.
(2009) [23] proposed Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), an algorithm that
combines Laplace approximation with modern numerical integration in a Bayesian framework,
which can greatly shorten the computation time and improve the computation efficiency
and reduce the computation cost while guaranteeing the estimation accuracy of
MCMC algorithm. Bivand et al. (2014) [24] extended INLA by Bayesian Model Averaging
(BMA) for spatial econometric models and developed an INLABMA package. Go´mez-Rubio
et al. (2017) [25] described the implementation of a new class of latent models in INLA that
can be used to fit spatial econometric models directly to INLA. Go´mez-Rubio and Rue (2018)
[26] gave a new approach combining INLA and MCMC, namely MCMCINLA, making it possible
to fit spatial econometric models. Go´mez-Rubio et al. (2020) [27] further explored BMA
by using INLABMA for multivariate posterior inference of spatial econometric models with
good results.
Due to the limitation of random effects of spatial lag models, INLA currently only supports
estimating spatial lag models in parametric form, and no scholars have yet used the method to
estimate nonparametric spatial lag models. In this paper, we combine MCMC with INLA and
propose MCMCINLA estimation of nonparametric spatial lag models with the help of penalized
spline technique to explore the nonparametric relationship between covariates and
response variables in varying coefficient spatial lag models. This estimation method can overcome
the problem of long computation time of single MCMC and fill the gap that single INLA
cannot estimate nonparametric spatial lag models, which can provide new ideas for statistical
inference of nonparametric spatial econometric models.
According to statistics, the proportion of China’s population aged 65 and above has reached
13.5% by 2021, indicating that China has entered a deeply aging society [28]. In the context of
an increasingly aging population, how to adjust the industrial structure to continue to effectively
promote sustainable and healthy economic development has become a key issue for

current research. In the past two years, a large number of scholars have explored the relationship
between population aging, technological innovation, industrial structure and other factors
and economic development using different methods, and some useful conclusions have been
obtained. Song and Gao (2022) [29] explored the effects of population aging and private sector
market entry on economic growth by constructing the benchmark regression econometric
model and the synergistic effects econometric model. Li and Gao (2022) [30] studied the correlation
between technological innovation and economic development in the perspective of population
aging using the mediating effect and panel threshold effect model. Su (2021) [31]
conducted an in-depth analysis of how population aging affects economic growth from the
perspective of aggregate supply and aggregate demand based on the fixed effects econometric
model. Li and Qin (2020) [32] explored the relationship between population aging, social security
expenditures and economic development with the help of the dynamic panel data model.
However, in practical problems, the linear assumptions between economic growth and factors
such as technological innovation, income expenditure, and industrial structure are often
not satisfied, and simply constructing a spatial econometric model may not be sufficient to
fully characterize the regression relationship among the variables and may easily ignore the
key information. Based on the above considerations, this paper explores the economic development
of 31 regions in mainland China from 2015 to 2020 using MCMCINLA, and constructs
spatial lag models and varying coefficient spatial lag models successively for
comparative analysis of influencing factors and spatial and temporal characteristic distribution
analysis with population aging as a special variable, in order to further explore the hidden
information and come up with economic development strategies and suggestions that are
more in line with the realistic context of China.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Data source and preprocessing
Through the China Statistical Yearbook (http://www.stats.gov.cn), we collect data on 15 socioeconomic
indicators that can be used to reflect economic development in 31 regions of mainland
China from 2015 to 2020 as the object of our study, and the specific indicators and
corresponding variables for each indicator are shown in Table 1.
In view of the fact that the three variables of real estate development, foreign economy and
high-tech development contain a large number of indicators, and there are certain correlations
among the indicators with large differences in magnitudes, therefore, before the formal analysis,
the data of the indicators involved in these three variables are firstly de-quantified and standardized,
and multicollinearity diagnostics.
Abbreviate "real estate development" as A, the corresponding three indicators "sales of complete
sets of residential units by real estate development enterprises", "main business income of
real estate development enterprises" and "investment completed by real estate development
enterprises in the current year" are a1, a2 and a3, respectively. Abbreviation "foreign economy"
as B, the corresponding three indicators "total import and export of goods by region", "total
import and export of goods by foreign-invested enterprises by region" and "registration of foreign-
invested enterprises by region at the end of the year" are b1, b2 and b3, respectively. Abbreviation
"high-tech development" as C, the corresponding four indicators "invention patents of
industrial enterprises above the scale by region", "number of new product development projects
of industrial enterprises above the scale by region", "technology market turnover by
region" and "number of major enterprises in national high-tech zones" are c1, c2, c3 and c4,
respectively. The results of the multicollinearity diagnostics of real estate development, foreign
economy and high-tech development variables for 2015–2020 are shown in Tables 2–4.

Tolerance (TOL) or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) are generally used as the goodness
index to test the existence of collinearity. If Tol<0.1 or VIF>10, there is collinearity. It can be
found from the results in Tables 2–4 that there are different degrees of Tol<0.1 or VIF>10
among the indicators in each year, indicating that the indicators of real estate development,
foreign economy and high-tech development have collinearity, and further processing is
required to make the research results more reliable.
In order to eliminate the multicollinearity among the indicators, we use principal component
analysis to deal with it. The results of the principal component analysis of real estate
development, foreign economy and high-tech development variables for 2015–2020 are shown
in Tables 5–7.
According to the analysis results, the cumulative contribution rate of the first principal
component of real estate development and foreign economy reached more than 85%, and the
cumulative contribution rate of the first two principal components of high-tech development
reached more than 95% in each year, so the first principal component of real estate development
and foreign economy and the first two principal components of high-tech development
are selected as the final variable data respectively. And then, the remaining five variables are
also subjected to the de-quantile standardization operation to be used in the formal study.

where n = 186; ρ is the spatial autocorrelation parameter related to the spatial lag term, which
can reflect the existence of spatial correlation between regions;Wis the 186 × 186-dimensional
spatial weight matrix between regions at different times; βj is the regression coefficient of the
covariate xj; the error term ε obeys a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and diagonal variance-

The assumption condition of linear relationship between covariates and response variables
is relaxed on the basis of Model I. The variable coefficient term βj (U) is introduced to consider
spatial heterogeneity. In the context of China’s increasingly aging population, we pay more
attention to the impact of population aging on economic development, and focus our research
on the development and changes of the national economy with the deepening of aging. Taking
population aging as a covariate U in the varying coefficient function, still using the level of economic
development as the response variable y, and the remaining six variables as covariates xj,
j = 1,2,. . .,6 to construct a varying coefficient spatial lag model to further explore the relationship
between each influencing factor and economic development in the case of population

2.3 MCMCINLA algorithm
The MCMCINLA algorithm was proposed by Go´mez-Rubio and Rue in 2018 and can be used
to fit spatial econometric models, linear regression models with covariates having missing
data, Bayesian Lasso models and mixed models. The core idea of the algorithm is to divide the
parameters to be estimated into two groups, one using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm
in MCMC and the other using the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) algorithm [33] in
INLA, from which the estimates of all parameters in the model are obtained. Here, we use MH
for the parameter ρ for estimation and BMA for the rest of the parameters.
Since the INLA algorithm mainly targets the model with a structured additive regression
model with a latent random field of Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF), it is first necessary
to prove that the model conforms to the INLA framework before using MCMCINLA for
estimating the varying coefficient spatial lag model. Using a Penalized spline method based on
a cubic B spline basis with equidistant nodes to fit the varying coefficient term βj (U) [34],

Achieving punishment by setting a priori, the prior for α(j) is defined by the difference penalty,
with first-order differences corresponding to first-order Random Walk and second-order differences
corresponding to second-order Random Walk [35]. Here we use a second-order Random
Walk with backward differences, so that α(j) has a Gaussian prior with mean 0 and
accuracy matrix Q, and its accuracy matrix Q is semipositive definite, such that α(j) is an
IGMRF [36]. Letting

where ξ is the perturbation term added to the model. According to the previous analysis, it is
known that α has a Gaussian prior with mean 0 and accuracy matrix Q, and ε obeys a Gaussian
distribution with mean 0 and accuracy matrix τIn. Therefore, (x, α) is a GMRF with mean 0
and precision matrix P (structure as follows), so the model conforms to the INLA framework
and can be solved using MCMCINLA. Only the main results are shown here, and the detailed
proof procedure is shown in S1 Appendix.

It is worth noting that in the expansion of the varying coefficient term βj (U) using the B
spline basis function, its choice of both the number and location of nodes is very sensitive [37].
PLOS ONE MCMCINLA estimation of varying coefficient spatial lag model
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279504 May 15, 2023 9 / 19
To solve this selection problem, Eilers and Marx (1996) [38] suggested using a moderate number
of nodes and defining a roughness penalty based on the difference of adjacent B spline
coefficients to ensure that the fitted curve is sufficiently smooth, which here corresponds to
using a second-order Random Walk (RW2) prior for the penalty. The number of nodes is generally
selected using goodness-of-fit metrics such as AIC, BIC, and DIC, and here we use the
DIC to select the number of nodes. Another noteworthy issue is that the mean of the varying
coefficient term βj (U) is generally unidentifiable [39]. To ensure identifiability, it is required
that βj (U) is constrained to have zero mean, i.e., it satisfies 1
rangeðUÞ
R
bjðUÞdU ¼ 0, and thus βj
(U) can be included in the estimation at each iteration by MCMC centered on its mean.
The estimation process of fitting the varying coefficient spatial lag model using the
MCMCINLA algorithm is performed in four main steps as follows. All calculations are done
in the R-INLA (http://www.r-inla.org) environment in R.
1. P spline transformation. The curve is fitted using a cubic B spline basis function and the
RW2 prior f(U, model = "rw2") is set as a penalty for the model, at which time the parameters
to be estimated in the model are the parameter ρ, the hyperparameter τ and the parameter
α.
2. Estimation of ρ using the MH algorithm. The process is carried out in three main steps as
follows.
Step1: Assume that starting from the initial point ρ(1) = 0, the model is fitted conditionally
with ρ(1) to obtain π(y|ρ(1)), π(τ|y,ρ(1)) and π(α|y, ρ(1));
Step2: Use the MH algorithm to sample from the posterior of ρ, propose a new point ρ* for
ρ by proposing the distribution q( │ρ(j−1)), fit the model conditionally on ρ* to obtain π(y|ρ*),
π(τ|y,ρ*) and π(α│y,ρ*), and calculate π(ρ*), q(ρ*|ρ(j)) and q(ρ(j))|ρ*);
Step3: Calculate the acceptance probability P of ρ* and determine whether the proposal is
acceptable or not, where
P ¼ minf1;
pðtjy; r∗Þpðajy; r∗Þpðyjr∗Þpðr∗ÞqðrðjÞjr∗Þ
pðtjy; rðjÞÞpðajy; rðjÞÞpðyjrðjÞÞpðrðjÞÞqðr∗jrðjÞÞ
g; ð5Þ
if the proposal is accepted, then ρ(j+1) = ρ* with π(τ│y,ρ(j+1)) = π(τ│y,ρ*), π(τ│y,ρ(j+1)) = π(τ│y,
ρ*), π(α│y,ρ(j+1)) = π(α│y,ρ*); otherwise, ρ(j+1) = ρ(j), and π(τ│y,ρ(j+1)) = π(τ│y,ρ(j)), π(α│y,ρ(j
+1)) = π(α│y,ρ(j)). This iterative process is executed until the end of the estimation.
3. Estimation of τ and α using the BMA algorithm. For the hyperparameter τ and the parameter
α, the conditional margins π(τ│y,ρ(j)) and π(α│y,ρ(j)) generated by the MH algorithm in
each iteration can be obtained using BMA, and further the posterior margins of0 τ and α
are derived by integrating over ρ, namely

4. Estimation of βj (U). The model fitted using MCMCINLA is the model fitted by P spline,
which is directly obtained as an estimate about α(j). Therefore, it is finally necessary to
PLOS ONE MCMCINLA estimation of varying coefficient spatial lag model
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279504 May 15, 2023 10 / 19
multiply it with the design matrix B(j) to obtain an estimate of the varying coefficient term
βj (U) using βj (U) = B(j)α(j).
3. Results analysis
3.1 Model selection
Deviance information criterion (DIC) and Widely applicable information criterion (WAIC)
are two commonly used metrics to evaluate the fitting effectiveness of Bayesian models, and in
general, the smaller the value of DIC and WAIC, the better the fit of the model. From the fitting
results in Table 8, it can be found that the DIC and WAIC value of the two models are
very small, and the value of Model II is smaller than that of Model I, indicating that the fitting
effect of Model II is better, which is more suitable for studying the dynamic changes of economic
development.
3.2 Analysis of factors influencing with spatial lag model
The Model I is fitted using MCMCINLA, and the estimated values of the spatial autocorrelation
parameters and the posterior estimates of the regression coefficients of each influencing
factor are obtained as shown in Table 9, and the regression coefficients of each influencing factor
are plotted as shown in Fig 1. As estimated by MCMCINLA, the spatial autocorrelation
parameter is ρ = 0.5946 (95%CI:0.3522~0.8450), indicating that there is a significant spatial
correlation between the economic development of provinces. To a certain extent, the economic
development of a region also stimulates the economic growth of the surrounding
regions. From the results in Table 9, it can be found that the 95% credible intervals for urbanization
rate, resident consumption and foreign economy contain 0, indicating that these three
factors have no effect on the economic development of the region. The posterior mean of resident
income, real estate development, high-tech development and population aging are 0.334,
0.460, 0.124 and 0.084, respectively, indicating that these four factors have significant positive
effects on the economic development of the region, and real estate development has the strongest
contribution to the economic development of the whole region.

3.3 Analysis of factors influencing with varying coefficient spatial lag
model
The Model II is fitted using MCMCINLA, and the estimated values of the spatial autocorrelation
parameters and the posterior estimates of the regression coefficients of each influencing
factor are obtained as shown in Table 10, and the regression coefficients of each influencing
factor are plotted as shown in Fig 2. At this point, the spatial autocorrelation parameter is ρ =
0.2745 (95%CI:0.0816~0.4312). The 95% credible interval for resident consumption contains

0, indicating that resident consumption has no impact on economic development. The factor
that has a significant negative effect on economic development is the foreign economy, with a
posteriori mean of -0.263. The factors that contribute significantly to economic development
are urbanization rate, resident income, real estate development and high-tech development,
with posteriori means of 0.143, 0.127, 0.256 and 0.357, respectively. At the same time, it can be
found that in the context of aging, high-tech development has replaced real estate development
as the most mobilizing factor for regional economic development.

According to Fig 2, it is possible to further explore the changes of economic development
and each factor in the scenario of increasing population aging in Chinese society. It is clear
from the figure that there is not a direct linear relationship between the influencing factors and
economic development. The urbanization rate curve is basically located in the positive halfaxis
of the y-axis, indicating that the urbanization process plays a certain role in promoting the
development of regional economy, and with the gradual increase of aging, the promotion role
begins to gradually weaken after reaching a certain peak. The main reason for this change is
that the urbanization process can promote the influx of rural population to the cities to provide
more labor for the industrial development of the cities [40], while the increasing aging problem
makes the industrial development generate the problem of insufficient labor supply,
which leads to some impact on the economic development rate of the region. The vast majority
of the income curve lies on the positive half-axis of the y-axis, indicating that the income level
of residents also plays a certain role in promoting the development of the regional economy,
and with the gradual aggravation of aging, the role of income in promoting economic development
is first decreasing and then increasing. The real estate development curves are basically
located in the positive half-axis of the y-axis, indicating that the development of real estate has
a certain role in promoting the development of the regional economy, and it is most fluctuated
by the influence of aging. The main reason is that the construction of real estate requires a
large amount of labor force, and the increasing proportion of the aging population directly
reduces the main source of engineering construction, which has a certain impact on the development
of the real estate industry and the economic development of the region. The foreign
economy curve basically lies in the negative half-axis of the y-axis, indicating that the development
of external economic trade does not have a catalytic effect on regional economic growth,
and with the gradual increase of aging, the hindering effect of foreign economy on economic
development becomes more and more obvious. The main reason for this phenomenon is the
decline in the supply of young adult labor after reaching its peak in the context of an aging
population, which has led some foreign-invested companies to relocate their factories to
regions with a large pool of low-cost labor, such as India [41], thus hampering foreign trade
and economic development. The curve of high-tech development basically lies in the positive
half-axis of the y-axis, indicating that the development of high-tech plays a certain role in promoting
the development of regional economy, and the promotion role gradually increases
with the gradual aggravation of aging. The aging population has made people realize that it is
difficult to continue to promote rapid economic growth by relying on labor-intensive industries,
so they have started to adjust the industrial structure and use high-tech intelligent equipment
to replace labor, thus alleviating the economic impact caused by the lack of labor supply
[42] and enabling the sustainable and healthy development of the regional economy.
3.4 Analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics with varying coefficient
spatial lag model
The posterior mean of population aging variables are obtained using MCMCINLA and the
spatial and temporal distribution of China’s economic development from 2015 to 2020 is plotted
as shown in Fig 3. It can be found that from a temporal perspective, the economic development
of each region during 2015–2019 has continued to improve, and by 2019 there have been
a number of regions such as Hebei and Sichuan where the posterior mean of economic development
has reached more than 1.4, while thereafter, the COVID-19 began to appear in
Wuhan City, Hubei Province at the end of 2019, and under the impact of the epidemic, the
economic level of each region in the country in 2020 has seen a significant decline, reaching a
maximum of only 1.27. From a spatial perspective, the development of China’s economy has
PLOS ONE MCMCINLA estimation of varying coefficient spatial lag model
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279504 May 15, 2023 14 / 19
some spatial variability, with the economic development level of the eastern provinces being
significantly higher than that of the western provinces. And with the deepening of aging in
recent years, Hebei, Sichuan, Hubei and Jiangsu still lead the country in terms of economic
level. The "Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei" city circle with Beijing and Tianjin as the center and Hebei
as the joint venture, the "Sichuan-Chongqing" city cluster with Sichuan and Chongqing as the

center, and the "Yangtze River Delta" economic zone built around the Yangtze River basin
have attracted many young people from other provinces to move to them, enabling the
regional economy to continue to grow despite the increasing aging population. In addition,
according to the spatial distribution map of China’s economic development in 2020, it can be
found that Xinjiang may become a potential region for future economic growth. It can draw
on the development experience of urban agglomerations to build a network of cities in the
northwest, shrink the economic differences between the east and west, and promote further
economic development in the northwest. From the perspective of space-time, the gap between
the rich and the poor has gradually narrowed, the level of economic development has become
more balanced, and the national economic status has tended to be stable. The deepening of
population aging has prompted many enterprises to start the transformation from traditional
industries to high-tech industries, and through the construction of urban agglomerations,
"from point to area", drive the economic development of many regions, and effectively achieve
common prosperity.
4. Discussion
By using MCMCINLA to fit the spatial lag model with unvarying coefficients and the spatial
lag model with varying coefficients respectively, it can be found that both models conclude
that resident income, real estate development and high-tech development will positively contribute
to regional economic growth.
However, the comparison also reveals the differences between the two models. After considering
the study object in a nonparametric framework, the spatial autocorrelation parameter
of the model is significantly lower. The assumption of linear relationship between variables in
the classical spatial lag model affects the spatial relationship to a certain extent, making the estimation
of spatial correlation high; however, in the context of varying coefficients, this problem
can be corrected, making the estimation of spatial autocorrelation parameters in the model
more accurate.
After considering the study object in a nonparametric framework, the effect of some of the
influencing factors on the response variable has changed, making the results more relevant to
reality. For example, the effects of urbanization rate and foreign economy on economic growth
change from no effect to positive and negative effects, respectively. To a certain extent, promoting
urbanization can promote the development of industry, which in turn promotes
regional economic growth; the aging population makes foreign companies shift more to countries
with more cheap labor, leading to some restrictions on the development of foreign economy,
which is consistent with reality.
After considering the study object in a nonparametric framework, it is possible to dig
deeper into the changing relationships and evolutionary trends among variables. Under the
condition of constant coefficients, we can only derive the one-to-one correspondence between
each influencing factor and the response variable; while in the context of varying coefficients,
we can further obtain the trend of the remaining variables and the response variable as one variable
changes, so as to make an accurate study of future development and realize one-to-many.
After considering the study object in a nonparametric framework, important variables can
be more precisely located to provide strategic references for future development. For example,
after setting the factor of population aging as a covariate of the varying coefficient function,
the most influential factor on economic development changes from real estate development to
high-tech development, which is more suitable for the current economic and social reality in
China, so the adjustment of industrial structure can be focused on high-tech, automatic and
intelligent system construction in the future.

5. Conclusion
Classical spatial lag models often require linear assumption modeling, while they can also
explore the correlation characteristics of spatial data themselves, they are not sufficient to fully
characterize the regression relationships between variables in a linear framework alone. This
paper explores the nonparametric relationships between covariates and response variables in
the varying coefficient spatial lag model based on the P spline, so as to make up for the shortcomings
of the single linear regression of the classical spatial lag model and make it more practical.
In terms of parameter estimation, we propose the MCMCINLA estimation method for
nonparametric spatial lag models, which overcomes the problem of long computation time of
single MCMC algorithm and fills the gap that single INLA algorithm cannot estimate nonparametric
spatial lag models, and can provide new ideas for statistical inference. In addition, the
economic development data of 31 regions in China over 6 years are used as examples to explore
the issue of the influencing factors and spatial and temporal distribution of economic development
under the classical spatial lag model and under the varying coefficient spatial lag model,
respectively. In contrast, it is found that the varying coefficient spatial lag model can more fully
explore the data information more in line with the actual background, which can provide judgment
and reference for the development trend and strategy of the economic market.
In view of the high complexity of nonparametric spatial lag model itself, compared with
MCMC algorithm, MCMCINLA has greatly reduced the operation time, but due to the existence
of MH sampling in the algorithm, the algorithm still has the problem of long calculation
time in the face of high-dimensional data, which is more suitable for small sample analysis. In
addition, this paper mainly analyzes longitudinal data by setting the coefficient function as an
unknown function of a covariate. In the future, it can be extended to spatial panel data, and
the coefficient function can be set as a function form of spatial position coordinates to conduct
more in-depth research on spatial distribution and spatiotemporal distribution.
