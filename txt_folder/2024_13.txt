Abstract
Background and Objectives: The co-occurring trends of population aging and climate change mean that rising numbers of U.S. older adults are
at risk of intensifying heat exposure. We estimate county-level variations in older populations’ heat exposure in the early (1995–2014) and mid
(2050) 21st century. We identify the extent to which rising exposures are attributable to climate change versus population aging.
Research Design and Methods: We estimate older adults’ heat exposure in 3,109 counties in the 48 contiguous U.S. states. Analyses use
NASA NEX Global Daily Downscaled Product (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) climate data and county-level projections for the size and distribution of the
U.S. age 69+ population.
Results: Population aging and rising temperatures are documented throughout the United States, with particular “hotspots” in the Deep South,
Florida, and parts of the rural Midwest. Increases in heat exposure by 2050 will be especially steep in historically colder regions with large older
populations in New England, the upper Midwest, and rural Mountain regions. Rising temperatures are driving exposure in historically colder
regions, whereas population aging is driving exposure in historically warm southern regions.
Discussion and Implications: Interventions to address the impacts of temperature extremes on older adult well-being should consider the
geographic distribution and drivers of this exposure. In historically cooler areas where climate change is driving exposures, investments in warning
systems may be productive, whereas investments in health care and social services infrastructures are essential in historically hot regions
where exposures are driven by population aging.

Climate change has dire consequences for older adults’ health
and well-being (Meade et al., 2020). Global increases in the
frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat spells pose
the most direct threat, given older adults’ heightened susceptibility
to hyperthermia and common health conditions
worsened by heat exposure such as cardiovascular disease
(Khatana et al., 2022). These threats are exacerbated for older
adults who are socially isolated, live in substandard housing
with inadequate cooling systems, or lack financial resources
to adapt their homes to heat extremes (Gamble et al., 2013).
The multiple heat-related deaths of Florida nursing home residents
following an extensive power outage during Hurricane
Irma in 2017 starkly reveal how climate change-driven increases
in ambient temperatures threaten older adults (Skarha
et al., 2021).
Despite extensive literature documenting the individuallevel
effects of extreme heat on older adults’ health and
mortality risk, gerontological researchers have paid less
attention to older adults’ heat exposure at the population level
(Gamble et al., 2013; Meade et al., 2020). Two co-occurring
trends—population aging and climate change—may create a
context in which particular U.S. regions become “hotspots”
with both increasing concentrations of older adults and hightemperature
extremes. These hotspots will be at elevated levels
of population-level heat exposure, placing high demands on
local governments to develop appropriate infrastructures and
response systems (Dahl et al., 2019).
We apply measures and methods widely used in environmental
sciences to estimate (a) current (2020) and projected
change (2020–2050) in the population of adults age 69+ in
the 3,109 counties in the 48 coterminous United States; (b)

exposure, measured as the co-occurrence of both population

Background
Climate Change and Older Adult Well-Being
Since the 1960s, the frequency of extreme heat and weather events in the United States and worldwide has increased dramatically (Dahl et al., 2019). The period between 2015 and 2022 recorded the highest average temperatures in history (World Meteorological Organization, 2023). Rising temperatures are driven largely by emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gasses caused by human activity (Vose et al., 2017). The harmful health consequences of heat extremes are well established, with older adults especially vulnerable (Ayalon et al., 2021; Meade et al., 2020). Age-related biological changes reduce older adults’ capacity to thermoregulate (Sajjad et al., 2022). Medications commonly taken by older adults can further intensify their vulnerability to heat exposure (Millyard et al., 2020). Anticholinergic medications, used to treat health conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, reduce one’s capacity to sweat and thermoregulate (Westaway et al., 2015). Beta-blockers and diuretics can cause side effects that intensify heat-related symptoms such as dehydration (Meade et al., 2020). Age-related physical, cognitive, and sensory impairments may undermine an older adult’s capacity to prepare for and respond to heat extremes (Davies & Bhutta, 2022).
Population Aging and Heat Exposure
Gerontological research on climate change and its impacts on older adults largely emphasizes individual-level sources of vulnerability and resilience, such as physiological factors that heighten sensitivity to temperature extremes, and personal resources that enable one to manage the impacts of temperature extremes, such as high-quality housing with sufficient cooling systems, supportive networks, and cognitive capacities that enable effective risk assessment and planning (Gamble et al., 2013; Meade et al. 2020). Yet vulnerability and resilience also operate at a population level; differential exposure to extreme heat varies across regions of the United States, affecting communities’ capacities to create responsive infrastructures. Social and economic factors, such as the final resources available for infrastructure investments, the political and public will to implement carbon neutrality goals, and the efficacy of local warning systems, influence a region’s capacity to adapt to rising temperature extremes (Howe et al., 2015). Locations with large and growing populations of older adults and rising heat extremes are likely to face the most urgent demands for effective adaptation (Jones et al., 2015).
Population aging is arguably the most significant force impelling the need for such adaptations. (Other population characteristics including education, poverty status, and race/ethnicity also affect an area’s vulnerability and capacity to respond to climate change; Environmental Protection Agency, 2021.) In 2020, adults ages 65+ accounted for 17% of the U.S. population, with a projected increase to 25% by 2060. U.S. states and regions are not aging uniformly, however. Due to population processes including differential birth rates, migration, and aging-in-place, older adults are disproportionately concentrated in particular regions. States with the oldest population structures, where one-fifth of residents are ages 65+, include retirement magnets such as Florida, as well as rural New England and Rust Belt states marked by aging-in-place, such as Maine and West Virginia. By contrast, just 11% of Utah residents are age 65+ due to high birth rates. Variation at the county level is even wider, ranging from 15% in Lee County, VA, to more than 58% in Sumter County, FL—home to The Villages, the nation’s largest retirement community (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020b). In addition to being the “oldest” state in the nation, Florida is particularly affected by extreme climate and weather events, exposing large numbers of older adults to risk (Gamble et al., 2013).
Identifying regions of the U.S. projected to become “hotspots” with growing concentrations of both older adults and heat exposures requires the use of sophisticated measures and methods developed by spatial and environmental scientists (Jones et al., 2015; Striessnig et al., 2019). These approaches are ideally suited for addressing an urgent question in social gerontology: In which U.S. counties and states are older adults experiencing the greatest exposure to extreme temperatures, and how will that exposure change in the future? Projecting changes in older adults’ heat exposure is critical for adaptation planning and implementation. Yet refining what these efforts should entail also depends on the mechanisms driving exposure. Climate change research identifies three key drivers of a region’s future heat exposure: population growth, changes in the population’s age structure, and rising temperatures. The relative contributions of each driver may differ across regions, requiring tailored interventions (Jones et al., 2015).
The Present Study
Our goals are to describe the contemporary exposure of older U.S. adults to extreme heat and to project exposure at midcentury (2050); identify geographic regions that are most vulnerable to this exposure; and identify the main drivers of increased exposure. Areas projected to experience both population aging and rapidly warming climates are at the greatest risk of population-level heat exposure. Thus, analyses require fine-grained population aging and climate data across meaningful geographic units. To document population aging, we use county-level estimates of the size and geographic distribution of the age 69+ population in the 3,109 contiguous U.S. counties in 2020 and projected change from 2020 to 2050. To estimate heat exposure, we use measures of daily average temperatures, which capture cumulative heat exposure over the year, and the 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures, which capture acute exposure to heat extremes. We focus on both chronic and acute measures because each poses distinctive risks to older adults. Chronic exposure to temperatures above 77°F (25°C) in conjunction with high humidity can cause heat stress (Asseng et al., 2021). Even brief exposures to very high temperatures exceeding 95°F (35°C) with high humidity can threaten older adults’ health, with increases in the frequency and duration of high temperatures intensifying these risks. We use these measures to estimate contemporary and future heat exposure of older adults and county-level variation in that exposure and estimate the relative contributions of population aging, population growth, and climate change to older adults’ heat exposure, at the state and Census region level.

Method
Data
We use two main data sources: county-level population projections and gridded daily temperature projections. For population aging, we use current (2020) population counts and projections for midcentury (2050). Midcentury projections are based on data generated by Striessnig et al. (2019), who estimated decennial population size and composition by age group for 3,109 counties in the coterminous 48 United States over the period 2020–2100. County-level population projections (by age group and sex) are generated by simulating future demographic and migration dynamics under five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) scenarios. The five SSPs (sustainability, middle-of-the-road, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development) have been widely used in climate change research (Striessnig et al., 2019). We focus on projections of the share of the population aged 69 and older. Our threshold of age 69+ (rather than the widely used cut point of age 65+) is due to predefined age groups for which the population projections are provided (Meade et al., 2020).
Temperature data are from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) data set (Thrasher et al., 2022). We use daily average and maximum temperature outputs of 32 global climate models simulated under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016) ScenarioMIP exercise, bias-corrected, and downscaled to a global 0.25° grid. For consistency with our population data, gridded temperature series are averaged at the county level. Contemporary climate estimates are based on simulations of the 1995–2014 period, and midcentury (labeled “2050”) projections are based on simulations for the 2041–2060 period. For climate projections, we consider scenarios representing the fusion of the SSP scenarios and representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, which reflect different use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gasses (O’Neill et al., 2016).
Projections are based on two future scenarios widely used in climate research: SSP585 and SSP245 (Fricko et al., 2017; Kriegler et al., 2017). SSP585 represents a combination of the “fossil-fueled development” scenario (SSP5) and the high-warming scenario (RCP 8.5), whereas SSP245 represents the interplay of the “middle of the road” pathway of global socioeconomic development (SSP2) and moderate warming scenario (RCP 4.5). Given the inherent uncertainty of forecasting, we use two scenarios to provide insights into plausible alternative futures and their impacts on heat-related vulnerability. Empirical assessments of the likelihood of different climate scenarios conclude that there is “no clear consensus” on which pathway is most plausible (Huard et al., 2022). We focus primarily on results for the more extreme scenario (SSP585), which has been characterized as “relatively likely up until 2060” (Huard et al., 2022; 13) and highlight the modest differences detected using the more moderate projections (SSP245).
Measures and Statistical Methods
We transform NASA NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 daily average and maximum temperature records to construct two meteorological indicators of individual heat exposure. Cooling degree days (CDD) measure chronic heat exposure over the course of a year and the 20-year 95th percentile of maximum daily temperatures (TMax95) captures acute exposure to heat extremes.
CDDs are calculated as the excess of daily average temperatures over the threshold 75.2°F (24°C), cumulated over days in each year. This threshold temperature of 75.2°F is considered the minimum temperature at which air conditioning becomes necessary (Pavanello et al., 2021). Annual CDD values are largely determined by the duration of the hot season and the amplitude of peak temperatures. For example, a CDD of 1 refers to 1 day on which average diurnal temperature exceeds the 75.2° threshold by 1 degree. An average annual CDD of 450°F could reflect a climate with a long but moderate summer (e.g., 90 days with an average temperature of 82°F, 5°F over threshold) or a shorter but hotter summer (e.g., 60 days with an average temperature of 87.5°F, 7.5°F over the threshold). Turning to acute heat exposures, TMax95 is calculated based on each county’s within-time period distribution of simulated daily maximum temperatures. For example, a county where the 95th percentile of daily temperatures averaged over 20 years is 101°F is exposed to more severe heat risk than a county where the comparable 95th percentile temperature is 87°F.
We also construct cumulative population-level measures that capture heat exposure attributable both to climate change and population aging. Cumulative population-level chronic heat exposure is measured as person-degree days (PDD). This equals the average CDD level multiplied by the population over 69 years of age, in each county and time period. Cumulative population-level acute heat exposure is measured as person-degrees (PD). PD is the product of the extreme temperature threshold (TMax95) multiplied by the population over age 69 in each county and time period.
Finally, we estimate sources of change in population exposure over the first half of the 21st century. Using decomposition methods, we calculate the proportion change in older adults’ chronic heat exposure (PDD) that is attributable to each of the three theorized drivers: climate change, operationalized as ambient heat (CDD); population size, measured as the total population; and population aging, operationalized as the proportion of the population age 69+. We carry out decompositions at both the state and regional levels. Regions refer to the nine (coterminous) U.S. Census (2020a) divisions: New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, and Pacific (see Table 1 for further description).

in the Pacific and Mid-Atlantic. This geographic distribution
persists at midcentury, in both the SSP245 and SSP585
scenarios.
Population aging
Our projections confirm that the U.S. population is aging significantly,
with the fraction of population aged 69+ projected
to increase from 11% today to around 17% in 2050. Older
populations are currently concentrated in the Northeast, particularly
New England, the Midwest, and the South Atlantic,
especially Florida. The population age 69+ is projected to
increase by 40%–60% across both SSP scenarios, with the
largest increases in the West South Central, Mountain, and
Pacific regions (see Supplementary Figure 1A–C).
Climate change indicators
Across regions and for both SSP scenarios, we see high and rising
levels of chronic (CDD) and acute (TMax95) heat exposure,
although the magnitude of these patterns varies geographically.
The high (SSP585) and moderate (SSP245) warming
scenarios show similar patterns although the magnitude of
change is more modest in the latter scenario. The number of
CDDs is projected to increase in all regions, rising by a projected
73% (from 404 to 700) in the high-warming scenario
and 52% in the moderate scenario (see Supplementary Figure
2A–C). This overall increase is driven by dramatic increases
in cooler regions that currently experience few CDDs. For
example, under the SSP585 scenario, we see a 250% increase
in the Northeast, yet more modest increases (50%–75%)
in Southern states where the bulk of CDDs are currently
concentrated.
Current TMax95 estimates are in the low to mid 90°F range
across much of the country, with the exception of the slightly
cooler New England (87°F) and Pacific (89°F) regions and
the hotter West South Central (101°F). In contrast to the considerable
projected increases in CDDs, projected increases
in acute heat exposure are more modest and do not differ
markedly across the two scenarios (see Supplementary Figure
3A–C). At the national level, TMax95 is projected to increase
by just 4% (93–97°F) under SSP585, with similar increases
projected across the nine regions (ranging from 3% in West
South Central to 5.7% in New England) and under the SSP245
scenario. Although the distribution of annual temperatures is
moving upward for all regions, very extreme temperatures are
not increasing as dramatically.
Cumulative heat exposure metrics.
Cumulative population-level exposure to chronic (PDD)
and acute (PD) heat exposures show similar geographic
patterns, although with less dramatic increases projected
for acute exposure. PDDs currently are concentrated in
the South Atlantic and West South Central regions, dominated
by Florida and Texas, respectively. This pattern
persists to 2050, but its amplitude increases markedly. In
the high-warming (SSP585) scenario, chronic exposure
(PDD) more than triples nationwide, rising by a factor
of six in New England, five in the Mid-Atlantic and East
North Central regions, four in the Pacific and West North
Central regions, and three elsewhere. Comparable yet
slightly smaller increases are projected under the moderate
(SSP245) scenario. Acute heat exposures (PD) follow the
same general patterns as PDD, although the magnitude of
increase is more modest. PD is projected to increase 24%

in the cooler climates of the East North Central and Pacific
regions, as well as New England.
County-Level Analyses
We present our county-level results in four maps visualizing
the fraction of the population age 69+ and the average
yearly CDD and TMax95 exposure for contemporary population
counts (Figure 1A and B, respectively) and projected
changes therein by 2050 (Figure 1C and D, respectively). We
focus primarily on SSP585 for brevity, although similar patterns
of slightly smaller magnitude are detected for SSP245.
(Supplementary Figure 4A–D present maps for SSP245
patterns.)
For Figure 1A and B, the map key uses color-coding to
depict a county’s share of older adults (X-axis) and CDDs
or TMax95 (Y-axis for Figure 1A and B, respectively). The
key presents values in quintiles, to facilitate regional comparisons.
Both maps show clear regional and county-level
variation in the concentration of older adults and cumulative
heat exposure. We focus on CDDs because similar patterns
are found for TMax95, reflecting a 0.79 zero-order correlation
for current values. The maps confirm high concentrations of
older adults in the upper Midwest, upper New England, and
parts of the Pacific Northwest and northern Mountain region
(darker yellow), such that more than one-fifth of county residents
are age 69+ Those regions currently have modest heat
exposure, with CDD and TMax95 levels in the lowest quintile.
Conversely, pockets of the Deep South, especially the coastal
regions of Louisiana and Texas, and inland areas of southern
California and southern Nevada evidence among the highest
heat exposures yet very low proportions of older adults (deep
blue).
The maps reveal “hotspots” with high concentrations of
older adults and the highest levels of heat exposure (bright
red). Most of Florida’s east coast (except Miami-Dade
County), west coast, and north central regions are hotspots,
as are some areas of central Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.
Low-risk areas (pale yellow) have small concentrations of
both older adults and heat exposure. These areas are located
primarily in rural regions of northern Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming.
Figure 1C and D show change in county-level population
heat exposure under the SSP585 scenario. The map key
refers to change (in quintiles) in CDD or TMax95 and population
age structure over the contemporary through 2050
period. Results are remarkably similar for the SSP245 scenario
(Supplementary Figure 4A–C). Figure 1C shows that
high levels of population aging with more modest changes in
CDDs will occur in largely rural areas. The dark yellow areas
of Maine, northern and western New York, upper Michigan,
Wisconsin, and northern parts of Minnesota, North Dakota,
Montana, and the Pacific Northwest states, as well as rural
areas in western parts of Wyoming, Colorado, and New
Mexico and eastern Nevada reveal steep increases in share of
the population ages 69+ with flatter increases in temperature
exposure. Conversely, the flattest levels of population aging
with the steepest increases in CDDs (bright blue) are concentrated
in Florida, Oklahoma, the northern and eastern regions
of Texas, western Louisiana, parts of Arkansas, desert regions
of California, and southern Arizona.

The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 3 7
Areas with the greatest increase in both risks, with increasing
concentrations of older populations and CDDs (bright
red) are clustered in the largely rural areas in southwest Texas,
pockets of Kansas and Nebraska, coastal and bayou areas
of Louisiana, and western Mississippi. Other at-risk areas
include several major metropolitan areas that will experience
substantial increases in temperature, although more modest
population aging (medium blue and light orange areas). These
areas include greater New York City, southern New England,
Delaware, and greater Detroit.
Similar patterns are evidenced for TMax95 with a few notable
exceptions. Figure 1D shows that the nation’s historically
hottest counties will not see dramatic increases in their temperature
extremes, as noted by the yellow tint throughout
much of the south and southwest. However, pockets in Texas,
Arizona, and the Deep South will see considerable increases
in their age 69+ population. By contrast, historically colder
areas of the Northeast and upper Midwest will see proportionally
larger increases in exposure to temperature extremes.
Figure 1C and D show projected change, yet do not show
absolute levels of projected population heat exposure. Areas
revealing modest change in a particular dimension may still
fare poorly with respect to the total magnitude of exposure.
For example, Florida is projected to have a slight increase in
the share of the population ages 69+. However, the state-level
descriptive statistics presented in Supplementary Table 1 show
that under both the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, Florida
ranks second highest in the nation for population-weighted
CDDs, with projected values of 1,807 and 1,714, respectively.
By contrast, California—the nation’s current and projected
most populous state—has comparable population-weighted
CDDs of 306 and 290 under the extreme and moderate scenarios,
respectively. These CDDs demonstrate the absolute
demands on social institutions to address older adults’ heat
exposure.
Decomposition Results
Figure 2 shows the relative share of billion PDDs attributable
to population growth, population aging, and warming
for the nine Census regions. (Supplementary Figure 5 shows
state-level results.) PDD equals the total number of persons
ages 69+ multiplied by each person’s yearly cumulative exposure
to heat (CDDs), with a threshold comfort temperature
of 75°F.
The United States overall reveals relatively equal contributions
of the three drivers, with climate change playing a
slightly smaller role than either population growth or population
aging. The Census Division figures show variation,
such that climate change is a larger driver of future exposure
in historically colder regions, especially in New England and
to a slightly lesser extent the Middle Atlantic, and Midwest.
Climate change plays a lesser role, and overall population
growth and population aging are larger drivers in three
Southern regions and the Mountain region. The Pacific states
of the West show relatively equal contributions of the three
drivers. Supplementary Figure 5 shows further variation
by state, even within the Census regions, such that climate
change is the largest driver in the New England states ME,
NH, and RI, Mountain states of WY and CO, and Midwest
states of IA, MN, ND, and WI, and Western states of CO, MT,
WY. Population aging is an especially substantial driver in
southern and western states including AR, AZ, NV, and TX.
Although the relative impacts of climate change are most
substantial in historically colder regions, it is important to also
consider the absolute magnitude of these patterns. The Y-axes
in Figure 2 show levels of overall exposure (PDD), revealing

the greatest exposure in the South Atlantic region (which
includes FL), with a projected PDD level of nearly 20 billion,
followed by West South Central at around 12 billion. This is
vastly larger than the total exposure of less than 1 billion in
New England and less than 4 billion in the West and Midwest.
Discussion
Our analysis is the first we know of to project the U.S. regions
most vulnerable to older adults’ future chronic and acute heat
exposure, and the drivers of these patterns, allowing us to
outline implications for policy and practice (for comparable
global analyses, see Park et al., 2020 and Tuholske et al.,
2021). Our study yielded three key findings.
First, population aging and rising heat exposures are inevitabilities
in the 21st century, although the current levels and
magnitude of projected increases vary across and within U.S.
regions. Our results broadly suggest a “tale of two countries,”
whereby northern regions have relatively older populations
with more modest heat exposure, and southern regions have
relatively younger populations with more severe heat exposure.
However, a cluster of regions stands out as “hotspots”
distinguished both by high levels of heat exposure and older
populations. These hotspots are concentrated in Florida’s
coastal regions that are retirement destinations, and rural communities
of the Southwest, especially in Texas and Oklahoma.
Second, historically warm southern regions will see significant
increases in chronic heat exposure with flatter increases
in their exposure to already-high heat extremes (i.e., TMax95).
These regions also will experience the most dramatic
increases in their share of the population ages 69+, a pattern
we suspect is attributable to older adults’ desire to migrate
to warmer climates. As a result, southern regions will face
high demands for supports and services, as ever-growing concentrations
of older adults require suitable housing, health
care, and other infrastructures that enable them to adapt to
heat exposure. A different scenario is predicted for historically
colder areas of the Northeast, upper Midwest, and to
a lesser extent the northwest, with a particular growth in
extreme temperatures in the upper Northeast and Midwest.
These areas will see flatter increases in population aging, but
steady increases in chronic temperature exposure and particularly
sharp increases in heat extremes. Rising heat exposure
may pose substantial challenges to densely populated areas
of the Northeast and Midwest with older housing stock
and less efficient heating and cooling systems (U.S. Energy
Information Administration, 2022).
Third, decomposition analyses revealed that climate change
will account for a particularly large share of population heat
exposure in historically colder locations, including the northeast
regions of New England and the Middle Atlantic, and
the Midwest regions of the East and West North Central.
Conversely, population growth and population aging are
larger drivers in three Southern regions (South Atlantic and
both West and East South Central) and the Mountain region,
consistent with the results from our county-level projections.
Implications for Policy, Practice, and Theory
Our results suggest that different adaptations may be necessary
in historically colder versus historically warmer areas,
and these adaptations must address the distinctive needs of
high and rising numbers of older adults. As the climate continues
to warm, populations in northern states and at higher
elevations who are not accustomed to heat waves may require
education and early warning systems that provide advance
notice of dangerous high temperatures. National Weather
Service alerts could recommend protective measures such
as using a fan or air conditioning, visiting a cooling center,
avoiding overexertion, or increasing one’s water intake. Heat
alerts also could instruct older adults to seek health care if
needed, such as treatment for heat stroke.
Surprisingly, however, heat alerts have not been found to
lower mortality risk (Weinberger et al., 2021). To ensure maximal
effectiveness, messaging must be designed to educate older
adults and encourage appropriate actions, especially in regions
where residents may lack knowledge or minimize the importance
of extreme heat events (Bedi et al., 2022). Residents of
historically cooler U.S. regions perceive an unrealistically low
risk of extreme heat threats, despite their intensifying exposures
(Howe et al., 2019). More worrisome, older adults underestimate
their personal vulnerability to heat extremes, despite
their greater risk (Abrahamson et al., 2009). Gerontology and
geriatrics practitioners’ expertise may be helpful in shaping
the content and delivery of heat alert messaging. Home health
workers also could be tasked with educating older adults about
their heat vulnerability and providing educational materials
and heating response checklists (Gamble et al., 2013).
Historically hot regions generally have the infrastructures,
experience, and capacities to adapt to heat extremes.
However, in many southern areas, population aging will put
greater numbers of older adults at risk of heat exposure,
intensifying strains on health care systems, public utilities,
and other aspects of the infrastructure. These demands may
overtax existing structures, such as public cooling centers, and
will require adjustments to meet the distinctive needs of older
adults. Older adults often lack knowledge about the location
of cooling centers or have difficulty accessing these spaces
due to insufficient transportation or physical mobility limitations
(Bedi et al., 2022). Professionals serving older adults
are well situated to provide information regarding cooling
centers, encourage their use, and coordinate transport. Other
community-level initiatives might include the development or
expansion of registries and surveillance data on older adults,
and the use of geographic information systems to help first
responders identify those neighborhoods with the greatest
concentrations of older adults (Davies & Bhutta, 2022).
Physical infrastructure adaptations, including the installation
of air conditioning in institutional and residential settings, via
energy efficiency incentives or building code mandates, also
are critical. However, these interventions are costly and require
additional electricity to provide sufficient cooling, especially
during hot summer months in which demand for power peaks
(Romitti & Sue Wing, 2022; Skarha et al 2021). As rising
numbers of people of all ages, but especially older adults,
rely on air conditioning to withstand high temperatures, this
added burden on power systems can threaten their reliability,
triggering blackouts precisely when the demand for electricity
for cooling is largest. Costly investments in power generation,
transmission, and distribution will be necessary, although such
investments may pose challenges to under-resourced regions
(Ralston Fonseca et al., 2021).
Infrastructure investments also may create negative unintended
consequences for older adults. For example, in 2017,
Florida mandated that long-term facilities install backup
power systems capable of providing air conditioning for at
least 4 days (Skarha et al., 2021). However, the high costs

The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 3 9
of these adaptations led to compliance delays, with some
experts cautioning that these adaptations could divert funds
from staffing and ultimately compromise the quality of care
at some facilities (June et al., 2023). This case reveals the
importance of climate-related policies that explicitly consider
the simultaneous impacts of population aging.
Our study results have implications for theory and practice.
Cumulative dis/advantage models have been particularly
influential for understanding disparities in late-life well-being,
with much of this work emphasizing individual-level factors
such as education or parental economic resources as factors
that may have multiplicative impacts on late-life well-being
(Hatch, 2005). However, our work suggests that (dis)advantage
also can accumulate at the population level, such that the
co-occurrence of rising temperatures and growing aged populations
will pose particular threats to older adults residing
in these regions. The threats are further amplified in regions
that lack sufficient economic resources to make the necessary
adaptations to their public infrastructures or services.
Future Directions
Our study is the first step of what we hope is a robust research
program focused on the intersections of population aging and
increasing heat exposures. However, this analysis has limitations
that could be addressed in future work. First, we used a coarse
marker of old age (age 69+) due to data constraints; future
studies could consider more fine-grained age groups, especially
oldest-old persons (ages 85+) who are particularly vulnerable to
environmental threats. The State of Florida (2022) projects that
their age 85+ population will experience the steepest growth of
any age group during the period 2040–2050. “Hot spot” regions
with high levels of heat exposure and rapidly growing oldest-old
populations will require particularly heavy investments in their
health care facilities, as care needs increase with age (Federal
Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2020).
Future studies also could focus on additional sources of
area-level heterogeneity, such as the share of low-income persons,
urban versus rural populations, and solo-dweller households.
For example, “heat island” effects may be observed in
urban areas experiencing high temperatures, due to structures
like roads and buildings that absorb heat more than natural
terrains such as parks and forests (Lowe, 2016). Urban areas
also are home to disproportionately large shares of older,
lower-income, less educated, and racially minoritized populations—
populations who are more likely to live in substandard
housing with insufficient cooling systems (Romitti & Sue
Wing, 2022). Areas with high concentrations of solo-dwelling
older adults may face challenges with evacuation in the case
of a heat emergency (Bascetta, 2006).
Population aging is inevitable given historical fertility and
mortality trends in the United States, and rising heat levels
are likely given current and projected emissions trajectories in
the United States. We hope that our documentation of these
co-occurring patterns starts a broader conversation about the
impacts of climate change for regions with high and growing
numbers of older adults. Such conversations can help set the
foundation for devising age-sensitive climate change adaptations
to ensure the well-being of older adults.
