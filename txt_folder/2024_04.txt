We have developed instruments for magnetic neutron holography (MNH) using polarized white neutrons to
investigate the local magnetic structures of magnetic alloys. We chose the 3He spin filter method as the neutron
polarizer to polarize neutrons over a wide wavelength range of up to a few 100 meV. We developed a magnet
device to saturate the magnetizations of ferromagnetic samples, and instruments to transport polarized neutrons
from a 3He spin filter to the MNH sample. The neutron polarization, Pn, at the beginning of the MNH experiments
was confirmed to be 0.46, which is feasible for MNH. Using the developed instruments, we obtained preliminary
results for the room-temperature ferromagnetic alloy Fe0.08Co0.92. Technical problems encountered in the experiments
and ways to overcome them are discussed. Based on these results, we believe that MNH that use
polarized neutrons is promising.
1. Introduction
Magnetic alloys such as Fe–Ni and Fe–Co have attracted interest for
decades because of their exotic properties, such as room-temperature
ferromagnets as candidates for high-performance soft magnets and
low thermal expansion in Invar alloys. The properties of these alloys are
typically understood on the basis of the assumption that hypothetical
atoms, which are assumed to be mixtures of different atoms, form a
lattice without distortion. However, this assumption is incorrect for
actual alloys, in which the different atoms (e.g., Fe and Ni) are arranged
randomly. Therefore, the electronic states must differ for different
atoms, even in alloys. Moreover, owing to the size differences, the lattices
of the alloys are slightly distorted around each atom. Therefore, it
can be expected that a true understanding of the properties of alloys
requires clarification of the individual environment around each atom
rather than a model of the average structure without lattice distortion. In
fact, it was found that, in Fe0.08Co0.92, the lattice around Co (i.e., the
matrix crystal lattice) is more distorted than that around the dopant, Fe,
owing to the different crystal structures of pure Fe (cubic) and Co
(hexagonal) using the element-selective imaging method, atomic resolution
holography (ARH) using fluorescent X-rays [1]. ARH is explained
in detailed later. In this study, the structural environment around a
particular atom is referred to as the local structure. Because the local
structures around particular atoms are not strictly translationally symmetric,
they cannot be observed using the conventional diffraction
technique, which observe the average lattice points in the crystals.

Recently, the local atomic structures have been actively investigated
using ARH [2–6]. The critical advantages of ARH over other techniques,
such as the conventional diffraction, pair distribution function (PDF),
and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques, are as follows:
(1) ARH is an element-selective technique, which can selectively
observe signals from a particular element, (2) three-dimensional (3D)
atomic structures without translation symmetry around the selected
element can be directly visualized without proper models, and (3) the
observable range is ~20 Å from the selected element, which is larger
than the typical observable range of XAFS and the lattice constants of
inorganic materials. Owing to these advantages, X-ray fluorescence
holography (XFH) and photoelectron holography (PEH) have been
actively used in radiation X-ray facilities to investigate of novel materials,
such as dilute magnetic semiconductors, multiferroic materials,
topological insulators, and superconductors [1,7–14].
On the other hand, for magnetic alloys, observation of the local
magnetic structures around selected elements is the key to understand
their magnetic properties. Neutrons are effective probes for magnetic
materials, such as in magnetic structure refinements using conventional
diffraction techniques, because they have a spin S of 1/2. Thus, neutron
holography (NH) is a promising technique for investigating the local
magnetic environments in magnetic alloys. NH was first proposed by
Cser et al. and demonstrated by Sur et al. in 2001 [15,16]. Several preliminary
experiments using NH for the visualization of local atomic
structures in reactor facilities have since been reported [17–22]. Moreover,
the accuracy of the atomic images visualized by NH has been
drastically enhanced by using white neutrons, which are neutron beams
with a wide and continuous wavelength range, by Hayashi et al. [23],
enabling accurate investigations of the local atomic structures of light
elements. Successful visualization of the 3D local atomic structure
around light elements or light elements around dopants has already been
accomplished in many materials using NH, such as a typical scintillation
crystal, Eu-doped CaF2 [23], thermoelectric materials, 0.75% B-doped
Mg2Si [24], a power semiconductor, 0.06% B-doped SiC [25], and 2%
Sm-doped RB6 (R: Yb, La), presenting the same structure as the typical
strongly correlated electron systems SmB6 and CeB6 [26], and a typical
semiconductor, 0.26% B-doped Si [27].
Magnetic neutron holography (MNH) using polarized neutrons was
proposed theoretically by Szak´al et al. [28,29]. Polarized neutrons only
have up/down spins. Polarized neutrons are useful for MNH because
they have a much higher sensitivity to the spin states in magnetic
samples than unpolarized neutrons. Szak´al et al. successfully visualized
magnetic images of tetragonal spinel CuCr2O4 using simulation [28,29].
However, no MNH experiments have been conducted to date. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to develop equipment for MNH experiments
using polarized white neutrons at Japan Proton Accelerator Research
Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai, Japan.
2. Neutron polarizers
Neutron polarizers, which are key devices for MNH, transmit or
reflect only neutrons with up or down spins; thus, the transmitted or
reflected beams are composed of polarized neutrons. There are three
types of practical neutron polarizers for structural physics experiments:
(1) ferromagnetic single crystals, such as Cu2MnAl and Fe0.08Co0.92; (2)
supermirrors, which are multilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic
and nonmagnetic thin films, such as Fe/Ge multilayers; and (3) 3He spin
filters. For NH, including MNH, white neutrons with energies between 1
and 600 meV are indispensable for enhancing the accuracy of atomic/
magnetic images [23]. Among the three types of polarizers,
single-crystal polarizers can simultaneously monochromate and polarize
the neutron beam, and supermirror polarizers can only polarize neutrons
below approximately 10 meV, making them unsuitable for MNH.
In contrast, 3He spin-filter polarizers can polarize white neutrons even
with neutron energies, En, above 1 eV. Therefore, 3He spin filters are the
most suitable for MNH, and were used as the neutron polarizers in this
study.
The 3He spin-filter technique has already been established and used
in many neutron facilities. At J-PARC, the 3He spins in the cell are
polarized using the spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) technique
[30–34]. Two operation methods exist for the SEOP technique: ex situ
and in situ methods. In the in situ method, the stable polarization of 3He
spins, PHe , can be obtained by continuous laser irradiation. On the other
hand, the in situ method requires a larger space for laser pumping instruments.
In the ex situ method, the instrument is compact, and the
operation is simple. In this study as the first stage, we operated the spin
filter using the ex situ method because this mode is suitable for test
experiments in a limited experimental space. However, in the ex situ
method, PHe decays exponentially owing to the nonuniformity of the
surrounding magnetic field, collisions of 3He atoms with each other, and
collisions of 3He atoms with impurities in the glass cell and glass wall.
The details of each effect are discussed in Ref.32 and 34. The typical
relaxation time (τ) of the ex situ method in J-PARC is approximately
50–200 h. Details of the ex situ method in J-PARC are reported in
Ref. 32.
The polarization of the neutron beam (Pn) is defined as follows:
Pn =
N+ 􀀀 N􀀀
N+ + N􀀀 (1)
where N± denotes the number of neutrons with up (+) and down (􀀀 )
spins in the beam. For the 3He spin filters, Pn and transmission (Tn) are
calculated as follows [32]:
Pn =tanh(PHeσa(λ)d) (2)
Tn =e􀀀 σa(λ)d cosh(PHeσa(λ)d) (3)
where σa(λ) represents the neutron absorption cross-section at wavelength
λ. d corresponds to the areal density of 3He and is defined as d =
2.65× 1017 Pl, where P indicates the 3He gas pressure in kPa and l indicates
the pass length of the 3He gas in cm. In the experiments of the
MNH experiments described later, we used the cells called Chidori and
Karigane. The dimension and P of Chidori and Karigane are ϕ4.5 cm ×
7.5 cm and 314 kPa, respectively [32]. Using the cells, a PHe value of 0.8
is stably achieved in J-PARC; the champion PHe is 0.853(5) [32], which
is the top-class PHe in the world. Fig. 1 shows the neutron energy (En)
dependence of the Pn of the 3He spin filter calculated using eq. (2) using
the parameters of Chidori and Karigane (d = 5.75 × 1020/cm2). Neutrons
can be polarized over a wide energy range using a 3He spin filter
with PHe ∼ 0.8. As an energy region between 10 and 200 meV is often
used for NH analysis, 3He spin filters are the most suitable polarizers for

MNH.
3. Brief explanation of the principle of MNH
The principle of MNH is essentially the same as that of NH [23,27],
except that the scatterers in MNH are the spins of the magnetic atoms.
Fig. 2 illustrates the principle of MNH. When the incident plane wave
(black) of the neutrons enters the sample, spherical waves (blue (left)
and orange (right) spheres) are generated by the nuclei and spins of the
atoms. The Bragg reflections are caused by the interference at infinite
points between the scattered spherical waves generated by many atoms.
Additionally, the scattered spherical waves also interfere with the incident
plane wave, resulting in a standing wave in the sample. When the
neutron standing wave is absorbed by an atom (called an emitter) near
the scattering atoms/spins, prompt γ-rays are generated from the
emitter, and their intensity is proportional to the number of neutrons of
the standing wave at the emitter position. The energy spectroscopy of
the prompt γ-rays guarantees element selectivity, because their energy is
element-specific. For instance, the energies of the relatively stronger
prompt γ-rays of Co are 230 keV and 277 keV. Therefore, in principle,
only prompt γ-rays from the emitter can be obtained using γ-ray energy
spectroscopy. The holograms produced by NH/MNH are intensity maps
of the prompt γ-rays from the emitter, that is, the amplitudes of the
neutron standing waves at the emitter, on a sphere in reciprocal space.
An atomic hologram, χN(k), is represented as follows [23]:
χN(k)∝
{
2Re
Σ
j
[bj
rj
ei(k•rj+krj)
]}
(4)
where bj and rj denote the scattering length and position of the j-th atom
around the emitter, respectively, and k represents the wavenumber
vector of the incident beam. The direction of k relative to the lattice of
the sample can be changed by rotating the sample. The origin of rj is set
at the emitter, meaning that χ(k) includes information about local
structures around the emitter. The holograms represent the interference
between the incident and scattered waves. Thus, the phase change in the
scattering process can be recorded in holograms, meaning that the socalled
"phase problem" [35] in the conventional diffraction technique
does not exist, so that no model is required for NH/MNH analysis.
Based on the report of Szak´al et al., a magnetic hologram, χM(k), can
be represented as follows [28,29]:
χM(k)∝ 􀀀
{
2Re
Σ
j
[
r0|γ|SjPj
􀀀
qj
)
Fj
rj
ei(k•rj+krj)
]}
(5)
where r0 denote the classical electron radius, |γ| represents the neutron
magnetic moment, and Sj denotes the spin of the j-th magnetic atom
around the emitter. Pj(qj) is the magnetic form factor, that depends on
the scattering vector (qj) of the j-th magnetic atom. Fj is the polarization
factor, which carries information on the direction of the magnetic moments;
note that the sign of Fj is positive/negative when the neutron
spins are parallel (+)/antiparallel (􀀀 ) to the magnetization of the
sample. The χ(k) of ferromagnetic materials using polarized neutrons
with a polarization Pn can be expected to be χ±(k) = χN(k) ± PnχM(k).
Therefore, in principle, χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k) provides the pure nuclear (2χN(k))
and the pure magnetic (2PnχM(k)) components. Note that the difference
χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k) can completely remove the background in χ+(k) and χ􀀀 (k)
because the background components have no polarization dependence.
After correcting for the energy or time dependence of Pn using eq. (2),
magnetic holograms, χM(k), can be obtained. The local distribution of
the magnetic moments around the emitter in real space, UM(R), can be
directly visualized using Barton’s method [36,37]:
UM(R)=
Σ
k
eikR
∫
χM(k)e􀀀 k•Rdσ (6)
The origin of R is set at the emitter. The sum is calculated over the k
used in the measurements. For typical experiments at J-PARC, 130 holograms
with different k can be obtained. The multi-k analysis drastically
enhances the accuracy of local atomic images [23,27]; which is the
reason why white neutrons and 3He spin filters are indispensable for
MNH.
4. Sample for MNH: Fe0.08Co0.92
As the sample for the first step in the development of MNH, we chose
a room-temperature ferromagnetic alloy, Fe0.08Co0.92 (space group:
Fm3m), because NH/MNH can only be carried out at room temperature
currently. Fe–Co alloys have the largest magnetic moments among the
room-temperature ferromagnetic alloys of 3d transition metal elements
and are located at the top of the Slater–Pauling curve. In addition,
because Fe0.08Co0.92 single crystals are typical neutron polarizers, the
intensities of Bragg reflections are strongly dependent on whether the
magnetization of the crystal and the neutron spin are parallel or antiparallel.
Therefore, the neutron polarization during the MNH experiments
was confirmed using Fe0.08Co0.92, as explained later.
Single crystals of Fe0.08Co0.92 were grown by the vertical Bridgeman
(VB) method using a high-purity Al2O3 crucible at Institute for Materials
Research, Tohoku University, Japan. The raw materials in the highpurity
crucible were placed in a VB furnace. The furnace was filled
with Ar gas (1 atm) after evacuation. The crucible was heated to 1525 ◦C
at a rate of 50 ◦C/h and maintained at that temperature for 90 min.
Subsequently, the crucible was slowly cooled to 600 ◦C at a rate of 50
◦C/h. The heating power was turned off when the temperature reached
at 600 ◦C, and the crucible was allowed to cool to room temperature.
5. Magnet device for samples
For polarized neutron scattering experiments on ferromagnetic
samples, the magnetization of the samples must be saturated or at least
sufficiently large. If the magnetization is not sufficiently saturated,
magnetic domains with antiparallel or perpendicular magnetizations
will be present in the sample. The distribution of magnetization in the
samples reduces Pn by the Larmor presession of neutron spins in the
magnetic domains. This decrease in Pn is called depolarization. To avoid
depolarization, the magnetization of the sample must be saturated to
achieve a single magnetic domain state. Moreover, for MNH, the direction
of magnetization, M, must be fixed to the lattice during the
rotation of the sample using an ϕ–ω dual-axis goniometer. Here, the
ω-axis is perpendicular and the ϕ-axis is horizontal. The sample was
placed at the tip of the rod on the ϕ-axis goniometer and set on an ω-axis

waves by a nuclear (blue: left) and spin (orange: right). (colored on Web only).

goniometer. Therefore, for MNH, a magnet device to saturate the
magnetization of the sample must be placed at the tip of the ϕ-axis, and
the sample must be placed in the magnet device.
To design effective devices, we simulated the magnetic fields
generated by the magnet devices using the finite element method software
FEMTET [38]. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the magnetic field in
air between two neodymium magnets with dimensions of 30 × 30 × 20
mm3 and an iron yoke. We confirmed that the accuracy of the calculation
by FEMTET was within 10% by comparing the calculated and
measured results for a simple magnet device. At the center of the device,
the minimum magnetic field was calculated to be 0.5 T as shown in
Fig. 3(b). Though the magnetic fields in the magnet device is not uniform,
homogeneous magnetic field in the sample can be expected
because Fe0.08Co0.92 single crystals are good soft magnets. As shown in
Fig. 4, the crystal is cut in planes perpendicular to the (100) axis to set
the sample in the device. In most cases, the cylindrical axis of the sample
is not perpendicular to the (100) plane. A magnetic field in the sample is
applied along the cylindrical axis of the sample. This guarantees that the
magnetic moments are fixed along the cylindrical axis. Consequently,
the non-uniform magnetic field and the shape effect of the sample did
not affect the MNH experiments.
To judge whether 0.5 T is sufficient for the MNH of Fe0.08Co0.92, we
measured the magnetization curve of a Fe0.08Co0.92 single crystal with
dimensions of 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 using a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM) at the National Institute of Technology, Ibaraki College. Fig. 5
shows the magnetization curve of Fe0.08Co0.92 at room temperature. The
magnetization was saturated above 1 T with a saturated magnetization
of 1.88 μB at a magnetic field of 2 T, which is consistent with the reported
saturated magnetizations [39]. At a magnetic field of 0.5 T, the
magnetization is 1.71 μB, which is 91% of the saturated magnetization,
and falls within the saturation region of the curve, indicating that device
modeled using the calculations in Fig. 5 can sufficiently saturate the
magnetization of Fe0.08Co0.92. Based on these calculations, we prepared
various magnet devices, such as device No. 3, shown in Fig. 4. The
magnetic field at the center of magnetic device No. 3 without a sample
was 0.46 T as measured using a gaussmeter, which is still acceptable for
MNH experiments.
6. MNH instrument
The main components of the MNH instruments are the same as those
of the standard NH instruments [23,27]. The NH and MNH experiments
were performed at BL10 of the Materials and Life Science Experimental
Facility (MLF) in J-PARC [40,41]. The instrument for the standard NH
experiments comprised γ-ray detectors, a dual-axis ϕ􀀀 ω goniometer,
and 16 position-sensitive neutron detectors (PSDs) at a scattering angle
of ~90◦. The γ-ray detectors were covered with Pb blocks to reduce the
γ-ray background. For this study, we used two types of γ-ray detectors: a
CeBr3 detector for higher-energy-resolution measurements and a
Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) detector for higher-efficiency measurements. The ω-
and ϕ-axes were vertical and horizontal, respectively. The sample in the
magnet device was fixed to the tip of a horizontal aluminum rod on the
ϕ-goniometer (Fig. 4). A single crystal of Fe0.08Co0.92 was placed between
the magnets in the magnet device to subject it to a magnetic field
along the cylindrical axis of the sample. The neutron flight pass from the
neutron source to the sample position was 14.0 m, and the distance

cm. The neutron beam flux at the sample position is estimated to be 3.8
× 107 neutrons/cm2/s/at En < 400 meV when the proton power of
J-PARC is 800 keV [42,43]. The maximum angular divergence of the
incident beam was approximately 0.27◦. The directions of the [100] and
[010] crystal axes of the sample were determined via the neutron Laue
method using the PSDs with an accuracy of ~0.3◦.
Fig. 6 shows the typical alignment of an instrument for MNH experiments
using polarized neutrons, which contains a 3He spin filter in a
magnetic cavity, guide magnet coils, and the magnet device for the
sample. The magnetic cavity of a 3He spin filter contains a magnetic
shield and solenoid coils that define the quantum axis of the 3He spins.
Details of the cavity are reported in Ref.32. The spin filter used in the
experiments was operated using the ex situ method. The magnetic cavity
includes solenoid coils that maintain the polarization of the 3He spins
(red arrow) along the incident beam direction [32]. The guide magnet
coils are solenoid coils that generate horizontal magnetic fields to
maintain neutron polarization (blue arrows) and connect the magnetic
field between the 3He spin filter and the magnet device for the sample.
Fig. 7 is a photograph of the actual MNH instrument at BL10.
The direction of the 3He spins (red arrow in Fig. 6) in the cell can be
quickly flipped using the adiabatic fast passage nuclear magnetic resonance
(AFP-NMR) method. Since the “up” (blue in Fig. 6) and “down”
spins correspond to spins parallel and antiparallel to the guide fields and
magnetization of the sample, respectively, χ±(k) can be obtained by
changing the direction of the 3He spins.
7. First stage MNH experiments
We performed MNH experiments on BL10 using the MNH instrument
described above. Since PHe slowly decreases with time in the ex situ
method, with a τ of approximately 50–200 h, the 3He cell must be
periodically exchanged with another polarized 3He cell for long experiments.
For the experiments, we prepared two cells, Karigane and Chidori
with the same size (ϕ45 mm × 75 mm) and 3He gas pressure of 3.1
atm [32]. The sample was a single crystal of Fe0.08Co0.92 with a diameter
of 10 mm and length of 18 mm. Six CeBr3 γ-ray detectors were used to
measure the prompt γ-rays from Co as the emitter.
Although magnet devices such as those shown in Fig. 4 can sufficiently
saturate the magnetization of the sample, Pn is easily depolarized
upstream of the sample if the guide magnetic fields are not smoothly
connected between the 3He spin filter and the sample. Therefore, the
connection of the magnetic fields in the MNH instruments (Figs. 6 and 7)
was confirmed by measuring the magnetic fields along the beam pass
using a Gaussmeter immediately before the measurements. Moreover,
we confirmed that the neutron polarization was maintained by
measuring 200 Bragg reflections of Fe0.08Co0.92 using the neutron PSDs
at a scattering angle of approximately 90◦ just before the start of the
MNH experiments. For the Bragg reflections of ferromagnetic samples
using polarized neutrons, the intensity can be represented as follows:
I± ∝|FN|2 +|FM|2 ± 2PnFNFM (7)
where FN and FM are the nuclear and magnetic structure factors,
respectively. The sign ± means that the neutron spins are parallel (+) or
antiparallel (􀀀 ) to the magnetization of the sample. The neutron spin
direction can be changed by flipping the 3He spins (red arrow in Fig. 6).
Note that for 200 Bragg reflection of Fe0.08Co0.92, FN(200) ≈ FM(200) is
realized. Therefore, I±(200) is considerably different when Pn ≈ 1, while
the flipping does not change I±(200) if Pn = 0 in the sample.
Fig. 8 shows the spin dependence of the intensity of the 200 Bragg
reflections of Fe0.08Co0.92 obtained using the instrument shown in Fig. 7.
The En at 200 Bragg reflections was approximately 13 meV (λ ~ 2.5 Å).
The intensity changed with the spin direction, indicating that the
developed instruments could maintain their polarization at En = 13
meV. For the present setting of the instruments on BL10, we could not
confirm polarization in the higher energy region. In polarized neutron
diffraction experiments on other diffractometer in J-PARC using the
same magnetic cavity and a similar guide magnetic field alignment with
the MNH experiments on BL10, it was confirmed that neutrons were
polarized at En = 56 meV (λ = 1.24 Å) [44]. Therefore, even in the

spins of 3He and neutrons. The black arrow in the device indicates the direction

present MNH experiment on BL10, it is probable that neutrons up to 56
meV were polarized.
From the flipping ratio I+/I􀀀 in Fig. 8, Pn was estimated to be 0.46 at
200 Bragg reflections (En ~ 13 meV), at which Pn > 0.95 can be expected,
as shown in Fig. 1, indicating that some depolarization occurred.
Since the magnetization of the sample was thought to be sufficient as
shown in Fig. 5, it is highly probable that the depolarization occurred in
the upstream region of the magnet device owing to zero or weak magnetic
fields. This will be discussed in the next section. In spite of the
depolarization, since the χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k) = 2PnχM(k) obtained under
these conditions is 0.92 χM(k), the MNH experiments to obtain χM(k) are
still feasible.
After the 200 Bragg measurements of Fe0.08Co0.92 shown in Fig. 8, we
began the MNH experiments. We repeated the MNH measurements three
times using Karigane, followed by two additional measurements using
Chidori after each cell installations to enhance the statistics, alternating
between the up- and down-spin conditions. Since one set of measurements
needs about 16 h, total measurement time was approximately 80
h. PHe was determined by fitting the neutron energy dependence of the
ratio Tn(PHe)/ Tn(PHe = 0), where Tn(PHe) and Tn(PHe = 0) are the
transmittances through the 3He spin filter in the polarized and unpolarized
states respectively. At the beginning of the experiments, PHe =
0.71 for the Karigane cell and 0.62 for the Chidori cell, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 1, a Pn of over 0.6 can be expected in the energy range of
10–200 meV. The relaxation of PHe was monitored using AFP -NMR
measurements during the experiments. Fig. 9 shows the time dependence
of PHe determined by AFP-NMR and the neutron transmission, Tn
(eq. (3)), of Karigane and Chidori. The relaxation time τ of Karigane was
estimated to be 106.1 ± 0.3 h by exponential fitting to the NMR data
(dashed line). On the other hand, the τ value of Chidori could not be
estimated accurately because we measured NMR and Tn only two and
three times, respectively. However, as shown in Fig. 9, the time
dependence of Tn for Chidori (black open circles) is slower than that of
Karigane, indicating that τ for Chidori is longer than that for Karigane.
The estimated τ value for Chidori was approximately 150 h. These τ
values are longer than the typical measurement time of 8 h for one
measurement of the parallel/antiparallel spin states in the present experiments,
meaning that the time dependence of PHe during one measurement
is not a serious problem. As the first step, we assumed that PHe
during a set of measurements of the parallel and antiparallel spin states
(~16 h) is constant, although the decrease in PHe over the first 8 h is
~0.05, which is not negligible. Countermeasures to address the loss of
data reliability owing to the time dependence of PHe are discussed in the
next section. Moreover, to minimize this effect, the data were obtained
in the order of the sequence of up-down-down-up spin states in the
present experiments.
The γ-ray intensity was measured in the angular ranges of 0◦ ≤ ϕ ≤
360◦ and 0◦ ≤ ω ≤ 50◦. The maximum ω was much smaller than that of
standard NH experiments (ω ≤ 170◦) to avoid the shadow of the magnet
device, which blocks the incident beam during the rotation. In the
measurement, a γ-ray energy range between 150 and 350 keV was
recorded because relatively strong γ-rays from Co are expected at
approximately 250 keV, that is, at 230 and 277 keV. Thus, this range
guaranteed that Co was selected as the central element (emitter). The
ϕ–ω angles and intensity of the prompt γ-rays from Co were connected
by the event recording data acquisition system of J-PARC [45], which
provides the ϕ–ω angular dependence of the γ-ray intensity. Fig. 10(a)
shows the ϕ–ω intensity map at λ = 2.75 Å (En = 10.8 meV) of one
measurement of down spin state without any correction. λ = 2.75 Å is
the longest λ in the λ range used for the standard analysis. In Fig. 10(b),
which shows the ϕ dependence of the intensity at ω = 10◦, the downward
spike-like signals are not noise but are caused by the periodic
decrease in the incident neutron flux by the standard operation of the
accelerator in J-PARC, which can be removed in the analysis. As shown
in Fig. 10(a), the shadows caused by shielding against γ-rays by the
magnet device were observed as two black valleys in low ω region
because the neodymium magnets in the manet devise are located between
the sample and γ-ray detectors at around ϕ = 60◦ and 240◦. On
the other hand, for ω > 40◦, white ridges are observed, which are
thought to originate from Compton scattering of γ-rays from boron,
which is a strong emitter of prompt γ-rays, in the neodymium magnets
because the incident neutron beam slightly hits the neodymium magnets
in the higher ω region. Moreover, γ-rays caused by the irradiation of
neutron Bragg reflections to the shields surrounding the detectors did
not affect the data because no obvious peaks or structures, except the

black valleys, are observed in Fig. 10.
It should be noted that most of the intensity in Fig. 10 is not hologram
signals but the intensity of γ-ray generated from Co in Fe0.08Co0.92
other than hologram signals. Since the shadows of the magnet device
have the same effect on the hologram signals and other γ-rays, the hologram
signals can be normalized by the total intensity of γ-rays from Co.
Since the effect of the shadows of the magnet device on the intensity is
not very steep (Fig. 10(b)), the total intensity of γ-rays from Co can be
determined by some combinations of polynomial functions for the ϕ
dependence of the intensity at each ω angle. The intensity map was
normalized and flattened using the determined polynomial functions.
Through this process, the effect of the shadows of the magnet device can
be basically corrected. Subtracting one from the normalized intensity
maps results in hologram signals oscillating around zero. The holograms
of the up and down spins in the range 0◦ ≤ ω ≤ 50◦ can be transformed
into the full sphere holograms (0◦ ≤ ω≤ 180◦) χ±(k) using the four-fold
and mirror symmetry operations of Fe0.08Co0.92 (space group: Fm3m).
Fig. 11(a) and (b) are χ+(k) and χ􀀀 (k) at En = 32 meV (λ = 1.59 Å),
respectively. Geometric patterns were observed in the holograms along
the [100] and [010] directions., which are slightly different in χ+(k) and
χ􀀀 (k). From χ±(k), χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k) can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 11(c)
and (d). Comparing χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k), the obvious four-fold symmetric
patterns in χ+(k) + χ􀀀 (k) disappear in χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k), while some geometric
patterns are still observed in χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k). The changes of the
patterns imply that nuclear components were subtracted in χ+(k) 􀀀
χ􀀀 (k). However, though we attempted to visualize magnetic images
using Batron’s equation (eq. (6)) using χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k), reliable images
were not obtained at expected positions of Fe/Co around the emitter Co,
yet. Possible reasons include insufficient statistics, limited ω angle, depolarization,
and the time dependence of PHe. The reasons and ways to
overcome these issues are discussed in the next section.
8. Technical problems
In this section, we discuss the reasons for the lack of success in
visualizing the nuclear and magnetic images in the present MNH
experiments.
First, the statistic required for MNH is discussed. As shown in Fig. 10
(b), raw counts in a pixel in the ϕ–ω map is 200 counts at λ = 2.75 Å
measured by one detector in one measurement. Although the required
statistic for reliable visualization of atomic images by NH/MNH is
strongly dependent on the experimental conditions and symmetry of the
samples, based on a comparison with experiments of successful image
reconstructions, for instance, 2% Sm doped YbB6 with space group of
Pm3m [26], we believe that the statistics of the present MNH experiments
is basically sufficient for visualization.
Next, the time dependence of PHe is discussed. Since we measured the
data using the ex situ method in the first stage, PHe decreased with time
during one measurement. Although in the analysis, we assumed that the
time dependence during a measurement (~8 h) can be neglected, the
decrease in PHe for 8 h is ~0.05, which is not negligible for an accurate
analysis. The decay of PHe interferes with the visualization. The best
approach to overcome this is measurements by the in situ method, in
which PHe is stabilized by continuous laser pumping. Since other

technical problems with MNH were identified in the present experiments,
the in situ method can be used in the second stage. In addition, a
compact in situ SEOP system is now being developed at J-PARC, which
can be installed in the limited space of MNH experiments on BL10.
Subsequently, the effect of a limited ω-range is discussed. In the
present MNH experiments, the upper limit of ω was 50◦ to prevent the
incident beam from hitting the neodymium magnets, while the standard
upper limits of XFH and NH is 70◦ and 170◦, respectively. In ARH, it is
well known that a limited ω-range affects the reliability of the reconstructed
atomic images. For example, for a Ge δ-layer buried in Si(001),
atomic images of Si reconstructed from data in 60◦ ≤ ω ≤ 90◦ is
anisotropically elongated along the [001] direction [46]. Since such
broadening makes the image difficult to observe, an expansion of
ω-range is necessary, at least up to 70◦. To overcome this, a magnet
device with a smaller dead angle by neodymium magnets, in which the
neodymium magnets and the sample should not be in direct contact, is
effective.
Finally, the cause of the depolarization from Pn >0.95 to 0.46, as
determined by the measurements of the 200 Bragg reflection in Fig. 8 is
discussed. Since the magnet device can apply a sufficient magnetic field
to the sample, the cause of the depolarization is an incomplete
connection of the guide magnetic field around the magnet device. To
confirm this, we prepared an off-beam setting of the same guide magnet
coils and the magnet device as in the MNH experiment on BL10 and
measured the guide magnetic fields along the beam direction using a 3D
Gaussmeter. Fig. 12 shows the positional dependence of the 3D magnetic
fields at the beam center in the upstream region of the magnet device at
(a) ω = 0◦ and ϕ = 0◦, (b) ω = 25◦ and ϕ = 0◦, (c) ω = 50◦ and ϕ = 0◦, and
(d) ω = 25◦ and ϕ = 90◦. The origin of the horizontal axis is at the center
of the magnet device. The z direction is defined as the beam direction,
and the x and y directions are defined as the horizontal and vertical
directions perpendicular to the beam, respectively. The closed circles,
open squares, triangles, and red solid line shown in Fig. 12 represent the
x, y, and z components of the magnetic field (Bx, By, and Bz), and the
total magnetic field (Btot =
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
B2x
+ B2y
+ B2z
√
), respectively. As shown in
Fig. 12, the main component in most area is Bz (blue arrows in Fig. 6),
which is farther than 4 cm from the magnet device, and the direction of
the magnetic field is almost parallel to the beam direction. In contrust,
there exists a minimum of Btot at approximately 2 cm, that is, in the gap
between the magnet device and the guide coils. In particular, in Fig. 12
(d), at ω = 25◦ and ϕ = 90◦, Bz becomes zero at 2.5 cm and is reversed
near the magnet device. The directions of Bx, and By are also reversed at
the same point. Consequently, the minimum value of Btot approaches
zero at 2 cm. Moreover, in the region less than 2 cm from the magnet
device, the maximum component is replaced by changing ω and ϕ,
indicating that the direction of the magnetic field near the magnet device
changes in complex ways by changing ω and ϕ. Therefore, the depolarization
shown in Fig. 8 is caused by the areas with zero magnetic
field and complicated changes in the direction of the magnetic field just
before the sample. Moreover, because the depolarization by these effects
is more severe in higher energy regions, the energy range that can be
used for visualization is limited. This reduces the accuracy of atomic
magnetic images. This could be the main reason of for the difficulty in
reproducing magnetic images.
It is highly probable that the insufficient connection of the guide
magnetic field is caused by the return magnetic field generated by the
neodymium magnets in the magnet device shown in Figs. 3 and 4(a)
because the return magnetic field around the neodymium magnets is in
the opposite direction of the magnetic field inside the magnet device and
the magnetization of the sample. Therefore, it is effective to avoid direct
contact between the magnet and the sample, and to keep the magnet and
sample as far apart as possible while maintaining sufficient magnetization
of the sample. The development of such magnet devices is in
dispensable for realizing MNH.
9. Summary
We developed instrumentation for the first magnetic neutron holography
measurements using polarized white neutrons, which we will
use to investigate the local magnetic structures of magnetic alloys at JPARC.
Using a magnet device to saturate the magnetization of the
samples and a 3He spin filter based on the spin-exchange optical
pumping technique, we polarized the neutron beams in the energy range
of 10–600 meV. We confirmed that the Pn in the room-temperature
ferromagnetic alloy Fe0.08Co0.92 using the developed equipment is
0.46 at a neutron wavelength of 2.5 Å by measuring the flipping ratio of
200 Bragg reflections. Under these conditions, we obtained preliminary
holograms of χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k). Though reliable atomic/magnetic images

could not be reconstructed yet, we found that the primary reasons
include the imperfect connection of the guide magnetic field, limited
ω-range, and time dependence of PHe. The technical problems of MNH
and ways to overcome them were identified in the present first-stage
experiments, indicating that MNH at J-PARC is still promising and will
be feasible in the near future. In the second stage, MNH experiments
involving room-temperature ferromagnetic alloys using the in situ
method are in preparation at J-PARC.

We have developed instruments for magnetic neutron holography (MNH) using polarized white neutrons to
investigate the local magnetic structures of magnetic alloys. We chose the 3He spin filter method as the neutron
polarizer to polarize neutrons over a wide wavelength range of up to a few 100 meV. We developed a magnet
device to saturate the magnetizations of ferromagnetic samples, and instruments to transport polarized neutrons
from a 3He spin filter to the MNH sample. The neutron polarization, Pn, at the beginning of the MNH experiments
was confirmed to be 0.46, which is feasible for MNH. Using the developed instruments, we obtained preliminary
results for the room-temperature ferromagnetic alloy Fe0.08Co0.92. Technical problems encountered in the experiments
and ways to overcome them are discussed. Based on these results, we believe that MNH that use
polarized neutrons is promising.
1. Introduction
Magnetic alloys such as Fe–Ni and Fe–Co have attracted interest for
decades because of their exotic properties, such as room-temperature
ferromagnets as candidates for high-performance soft magnets and
low thermal expansion in Invar alloys. The properties of these alloys are
typically understood on the basis of the assumption that hypothetical
atoms, which are assumed to be mixtures of different atoms, form a
lattice without distortion. However, this assumption is incorrect for
actual alloys, in which the different atoms (e.g., Fe and Ni) are arranged
randomly. Therefore, the electronic states must differ for different
atoms, even in alloys. Moreover, owing to the size differences, the lattices
of the alloys are slightly distorted around each atom. Therefore, it
can be expected that a true understanding of the properties of alloys
requires clarification of the individual environment around each atom
rather than a model of the average structure without lattice distortion. In
fact, it was found that, in Fe0.08Co0.92, the lattice around Co (i.e., the
matrix crystal lattice) is more distorted than that around the dopant, Fe,
owing to the different crystal structures of pure Fe (cubic) and Co
(hexagonal) using the element-selective imaging method, atomic resolution
holography (ARH) using fluorescent X-rays [1]. ARH is explained
in detailed later. In this study, the structural environment around a
particular atom is referred to as the local structure. Because the local
structures around particular atoms are not strictly translationally symmetric,
they cannot be observed using the conventional diffraction
technique, which observe the average lattice points in the crystals.

Recently, the local atomic structures have been actively investigated
using ARH [2–6]. The critical advantages of ARH over other techniques,
such as the conventional diffraction, pair distribution function (PDF),
and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques, are as follows:
(1) ARH is an element-selective technique, which can selectively
observe signals from a particular element, (2) three-dimensional (3D)
atomic structures without translation symmetry around the selected
element can be directly visualized without proper models, and (3) the
observable range is ~20 Å from the selected element, which is larger
than the typical observable range of XAFS and the lattice constants of
inorganic materials. Owing to these advantages, X-ray fluorescence
holography (XFH) and photoelectron holography (PEH) have been
actively used in radiation X-ray facilities to investigate of novel materials,
such as dilute magnetic semiconductors, multiferroic materials,
topological insulators, and superconductors [1,7–14].
On the other hand, for magnetic alloys, observation of the local
magnetic structures around selected elements is the key to understand
their magnetic properties. Neutrons are effective probes for magnetic
materials, such as in magnetic structure refinements using conventional
diffraction techniques, because they have a spin S of 1/2. Thus, neutron
holography (NH) is a promising technique for investigating the local
magnetic environments in magnetic alloys. NH was first proposed by
Cser et al. and demonstrated by Sur et al. in 2001 [15,16]. Several preliminary
experiments using NH for the visualization of local atomic
structures in reactor facilities have since been reported [17–22]. Moreover,
the accuracy of the atomic images visualized by NH has been
drastically enhanced by using white neutrons, which are neutron beams
with a wide and continuous wavelength range, by Hayashi et al. [23],
enabling accurate investigations of the local atomic structures of light
elements. Successful visualization of the 3D local atomic structure
around light elements or light elements around dopants has already been
accomplished in many materials using NH, such as a typical scintillation
crystal, Eu-doped CaF2 [23], thermoelectric materials, 0.75% B-doped
Mg2Si [24], a power semiconductor, 0.06% B-doped SiC [25], and 2%
Sm-doped RB6 (R: Yb, La), presenting the same structure as the typical
strongly correlated electron systems SmB6 and CeB6 [26], and a typical
semiconductor, 0.26% B-doped Si [27].
Magnetic neutron holography (MNH) using polarized neutrons was
proposed theoretically by Szak´al et al. [28,29]. Polarized neutrons only
have up/down spins. Polarized neutrons are useful for MNH because
they have a much higher sensitivity to the spin states in magnetic
samples than unpolarized neutrons. Szak´al et al. successfully visualized
magnetic images of tetragonal spinel CuCr2O4 using simulation [28,29].
However, no MNH experiments have been conducted to date. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to develop equipment for MNH experiments
using polarized white neutrons at Japan Proton Accelerator Research
Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai, Japan.
2. Neutron polarizers
Neutron polarizers, which are key devices for MNH, transmit or
reflect only neutrons with up or down spins; thus, the transmitted or
reflected beams are composed of polarized neutrons. There are three
types of practical neutron polarizers for structural physics experiments:
(1) ferromagnetic single crystals, such as Cu2MnAl and Fe0.08Co0.92; (2)
supermirrors, which are multilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic
and nonmagnetic thin films, such as Fe/Ge multilayers; and (3) 3He spin
filters. For NH, including MNH, white neutrons with energies between 1
and 600 meV are indispensable for enhancing the accuracy of atomic/
magnetic images [23]. Among the three types of polarizers,
single-crystal polarizers can simultaneously monochromate and polarize
the neutron beam, and supermirror polarizers can only polarize neutrons
below approximately 10 meV, making them unsuitable for MNH.
In contrast, 3He spin-filter polarizers can polarize white neutrons even
with neutron energies, En, above 1 eV. Therefore, 3He spin filters are the
most suitable for MNH, and were used as the neutron polarizers in this
study.
The 3He spin-filter technique has already been established and used
in many neutron facilities. At J-PARC, the 3He spins in the cell are
polarized using the spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) technique
[30–34]. Two operation methods exist for the SEOP technique: ex situ
and in situ methods. In the in situ method, the stable polarization of 3He
spins, PHe , can be obtained by continuous laser irradiation. On the other
hand, the in situ method requires a larger space for laser pumping instruments.
In the ex situ method, the instrument is compact, and the
operation is simple. In this study as the first stage, we operated the spin
filter using the ex situ method because this mode is suitable for test
experiments in a limited experimental space. However, in the ex situ
method, PHe decays exponentially owing to the nonuniformity of the
surrounding magnetic field, collisions of 3He atoms with each other, and
collisions of 3He atoms with impurities in the glass cell and glass wall.
The details of each effect are discussed in Ref.32 and 34. The typical
relaxation time (τ) of the ex situ method in J-PARC is approximately
50–200 h. Details of the ex situ method in J-PARC are reported in
Ref. 32.
The polarization of the neutron beam (Pn) is defined as follows:
Pn =
N+ 􀀀 N􀀀
N+ + N􀀀 (1)
where N± denotes the number of neutrons with up (+) and down (􀀀 )
spins in the beam. For the 3He spin filters, Pn and transmission (Tn) are
calculated as follows [32]:
Pn =tanh(PHeσa(λ)d) (2)
Tn =e􀀀 σa(λ)d cosh(PHeσa(λ)d) (3)
where σa(λ) represents the neutron absorption cross-section at wavelength
λ. d corresponds to the areal density of 3He and is defined as d =
2.65× 1017 Pl, where P indicates the 3He gas pressure in kPa and l indicates
the pass length of the 3He gas in cm. In the experiments of the
MNH experiments described later, we used the cells called Chidori and
Karigane. The dimension and P of Chidori and Karigane are ϕ4.5 cm ×
7.5 cm and 314 kPa, respectively [32]. Using the cells, a PHe value of 0.8
is stably achieved in J-PARC; the champion PHe is 0.853(5) [32], which
is the top-class PHe in the world. Fig. 1 shows the neutron energy (En)
dependence of the Pn of the 3He spin filter calculated using eq. (2) using
the parameters of Chidori and Karigane (d = 5.75 × 1020/cm2). Neutrons
can be polarized over a wide energy range using a 3He spin filter
with PHe ∼ 0.8. As an energy region between 10 and 200 meV is often
used for NH analysis, 3He spin filters are the most suitable polarizers for

MNH.
3. Brief explanation of the principle of MNH
The principle of MNH is essentially the same as that of NH [23,27],
except that the scatterers in MNH are the spins of the magnetic atoms.
Fig. 2 illustrates the principle of MNH. When the incident plane wave
(black) of the neutrons enters the sample, spherical waves (blue (left)
and orange (right) spheres) are generated by the nuclei and spins of the
atoms. The Bragg reflections are caused by the interference at infinite
points between the scattered spherical waves generated by many atoms.
Additionally, the scattered spherical waves also interfere with the incident
plane wave, resulting in a standing wave in the sample. When the
neutron standing wave is absorbed by an atom (called an emitter) near
the scattering atoms/spins, prompt γ-rays are generated from the
emitter, and their intensity is proportional to the number of neutrons of
the standing wave at the emitter position. The energy spectroscopy of
the prompt γ-rays guarantees element selectivity, because their energy is
element-specific. For instance, the energies of the relatively stronger
prompt γ-rays of Co are 230 keV and 277 keV. Therefore, in principle,
only prompt γ-rays from the emitter can be obtained using γ-ray energy
spectroscopy. The holograms produced by NH/MNH are intensity maps
of the prompt γ-rays from the emitter, that is, the amplitudes of the
neutron standing waves at the emitter, on a sphere in reciprocal space.
An atomic hologram, χN(k), is represented as follows [23]:
χN(k)∝
{
2Re
Σ
j
[bj
rj
ei(k•rj+krj)
]}
(4)
where bj and rj denote the scattering length and position of the j-th atom
around the emitter, respectively, and k represents the wavenumber
vector of the incident beam. The direction of k relative to the lattice of
the sample can be changed by rotating the sample. The origin of rj is set
at the emitter, meaning that χ(k) includes information about local
structures around the emitter. The holograms represent the interference
between the incident and scattered waves. Thus, the phase change in the
scattering process can be recorded in holograms, meaning that the socalled
"phase problem" [35] in the conventional diffraction technique
does not exist, so that no model is required for NH/MNH analysis.
Based on the report of Szak´al et al., a magnetic hologram, χM(k), can
be represented as follows [28,29]:
χM(k)∝ 􀀀
{
2Re
Σ
j
[
r0|γ|SjPj
􀀀
qj
)
Fj
rj
ei(k•rj+krj)
]}
(5)
where r0 denote the classical electron radius, |γ| represents the neutron
magnetic moment, and Sj denotes the spin of the j-th magnetic atom
around the emitter. Pj(qj) is the magnetic form factor, that depends on
the scattering vector (qj) of the j-th magnetic atom. Fj is the polarization
factor, which carries information on the direction of the magnetic moments;
note that the sign of Fj is positive/negative when the neutron
spins are parallel (+)/antiparallel (􀀀 ) to the magnetization of the
sample. The χ(k) of ferromagnetic materials using polarized neutrons
with a polarization Pn can be expected to be χ±(k) = χN(k) ± PnχM(k).
Therefore, in principle, χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k) provides the pure nuclear (2χN(k))
and the pure magnetic (2PnχM(k)) components. Note that the difference
χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k) can completely remove the background in χ+(k) and χ􀀀 (k)
because the background components have no polarization dependence.
After correcting for the energy or time dependence of Pn using eq. (2),
magnetic holograms, χM(k), can be obtained. The local distribution of
the magnetic moments around the emitter in real space, UM(R), can be
directly visualized using Barton’s method [36,37]:
UM(R)=
Σ
k
eikR
∫
χM(k)e􀀀 k•Rdσ (6)
The origin of R is set at the emitter. The sum is calculated over the k
used in the measurements. For typical experiments at J-PARC, 130 holograms
with different k can be obtained. The multi-k analysis drastically
enhances the accuracy of local atomic images [23,27]; which is the
reason why white neutrons and 3He spin filters are indispensable for
MNH.
4. Sample for MNH: Fe0.08Co0.92
As the sample for the first step in the development of MNH, we chose
a room-temperature ferromagnetic alloy, Fe0.08Co0.92 (space group:
Fm3m), because NH/MNH can only be carried out at room temperature
currently. Fe–Co alloys have the largest magnetic moments among the
room-temperature ferromagnetic alloys of 3d transition metal elements
and are located at the top of the Slater–Pauling curve. In addition,
because Fe0.08Co0.92 single crystals are typical neutron polarizers, the
intensities of Bragg reflections are strongly dependent on whether the
magnetization of the crystal and the neutron spin are parallel or antiparallel.
Therefore, the neutron polarization during the MNH experiments
was confirmed using Fe0.08Co0.92, as explained later.
Single crystals of Fe0.08Co0.92 were grown by the vertical Bridgeman
(VB) method using a high-purity Al2O3 crucible at Institute for Materials
Research, Tohoku University, Japan. The raw materials in the highpurity
crucible were placed in a VB furnace. The furnace was filled
with Ar gas (1 atm) after evacuation. The crucible was heated to 1525 ◦C
at a rate of 50 ◦C/h and maintained at that temperature for 90 min.
Subsequently, the crucible was slowly cooled to 600 ◦C at a rate of 50
◦C/h. The heating power was turned off when the temperature reached
at 600 ◦C, and the crucible was allowed to cool to room temperature.
5. Magnet device for samples
For polarized neutron scattering experiments on ferromagnetic
samples, the magnetization of the samples must be saturated or at least
sufficiently large. If the magnetization is not sufficiently saturated,
magnetic domains with antiparallel or perpendicular magnetizations
will be present in the sample. The distribution of magnetization in the
samples reduces Pn by the Larmor presession of neutron spins in the
magnetic domains. This decrease in Pn is called depolarization. To avoid
depolarization, the magnetization of the sample must be saturated to
achieve a single magnetic domain state. Moreover, for MNH, the direction
of magnetization, M, must be fixed to the lattice during the
rotation of the sample using an ϕ–ω dual-axis goniometer. Here, the
ω-axis is perpendicular and the ϕ-axis is horizontal. The sample was
placed at the tip of the rod on the ϕ-axis goniometer and set on an ω-axis

waves by a nuclear (blue: left) and spin (orange: right). (colored on Web only).

goniometer. Therefore, for MNH, a magnet device to saturate the
magnetization of the sample must be placed at the tip of the ϕ-axis, and
the sample must be placed in the magnet device.
To design effective devices, we simulated the magnetic fields
generated by the magnet devices using the finite element method software
FEMTET [38]. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the magnetic field in
air between two neodymium magnets with dimensions of 30 × 30 × 20
mm3 and an iron yoke. We confirmed that the accuracy of the calculation
by FEMTET was within 10% by comparing the calculated and
measured results for a simple magnet device. At the center of the device,
the minimum magnetic field was calculated to be 0.5 T as shown in
Fig. 3(b). Though the magnetic fields in the magnet device is not uniform,
homogeneous magnetic field in the sample can be expected
because Fe0.08Co0.92 single crystals are good soft magnets. As shown in
Fig. 4, the crystal is cut in planes perpendicular to the (100) axis to set
the sample in the device. In most cases, the cylindrical axis of the sample
is not perpendicular to the (100) plane. A magnetic field in the sample is
applied along the cylindrical axis of the sample. This guarantees that the
magnetic moments are fixed along the cylindrical axis. Consequently,
the non-uniform magnetic field and the shape effect of the sample did
not affect the MNH experiments.
To judge whether 0.5 T is sufficient for the MNH of Fe0.08Co0.92, we
measured the magnetization curve of a Fe0.08Co0.92 single crystal with
dimensions of 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 using a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM) at the National Institute of Technology, Ibaraki College. Fig. 5
shows the magnetization curve of Fe0.08Co0.92 at room temperature. The
magnetization was saturated above 1 T with a saturated magnetization
of 1.88 μB at a magnetic field of 2 T, which is consistent with the reported
saturated magnetizations [39]. At a magnetic field of 0.5 T, the
magnetization is 1.71 μB, which is 91% of the saturated magnetization,
and falls within the saturation region of the curve, indicating that device
modeled using the calculations in Fig. 5 can sufficiently saturate the
magnetization of Fe0.08Co0.92. Based on these calculations, we prepared
various magnet devices, such as device No. 3, shown in Fig. 4. The
magnetic field at the center of magnetic device No. 3 without a sample
was 0.46 T as measured using a gaussmeter, which is still acceptable for
MNH experiments.
6. MNH instrument
The main components of the MNH instruments are the same as those
of the standard NH instruments [23,27]. The NH and MNH experiments
were performed at BL10 of the Materials and Life Science Experimental
Facility (MLF) in J-PARC [40,41]. The instrument for the standard NH
experiments comprised γ-ray detectors, a dual-axis ϕ􀀀 ω goniometer,
and 16 position-sensitive neutron detectors (PSDs) at a scattering angle
of ~90◦. The γ-ray detectors were covered with Pb blocks to reduce the
γ-ray background. For this study, we used two types of γ-ray detectors: a
CeBr3 detector for higher-energy-resolution measurements and a
Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) detector for higher-efficiency measurements. The ω-
and ϕ-axes were vertical and horizontal, respectively. The sample in the
magnet device was fixed to the tip of a horizontal aluminum rod on the
ϕ-goniometer (Fig. 4). A single crystal of Fe0.08Co0.92 was placed between
the magnets in the magnet device to subject it to a magnetic field
along the cylindrical axis of the sample. The neutron flight pass from the
neutron source to the sample position was 14.0 m, and the distance

cm. The neutron beam flux at the sample position is estimated to be 3.8
× 107 neutrons/cm2/s/at En < 400 meV when the proton power of
J-PARC is 800 keV [42,43]. The maximum angular divergence of the
incident beam was approximately 0.27◦. The directions of the [100] and
[010] crystal axes of the sample were determined via the neutron Laue
method using the PSDs with an accuracy of ~0.3◦.
Fig. 6 shows the typical alignment of an instrument for MNH experiments
using polarized neutrons, which contains a 3He spin filter in a
magnetic cavity, guide magnet coils, and the magnet device for the
sample. The magnetic cavity of a 3He spin filter contains a magnetic
shield and solenoid coils that define the quantum axis of the 3He spins.
Details of the cavity are reported in Ref.32. The spin filter used in the
experiments was operated using the ex situ method. The magnetic cavity
includes solenoid coils that maintain the polarization of the 3He spins
(red arrow) along the incident beam direction [32]. The guide magnet
coils are solenoid coils that generate horizontal magnetic fields to
maintain neutron polarization (blue arrows) and connect the magnetic
field between the 3He spin filter and the magnet device for the sample.
Fig. 7 is a photograph of the actual MNH instrument at BL10.
The direction of the 3He spins (red arrow in Fig. 6) in the cell can be
quickly flipped using the adiabatic fast passage nuclear magnetic resonance
(AFP-NMR) method. Since the “up” (blue in Fig. 6) and “down”
spins correspond to spins parallel and antiparallel to the guide fields and
magnetization of the sample, respectively, χ±(k) can be obtained by
changing the direction of the 3He spins.
7. First stage MNH experiments
We performed MNH experiments on BL10 using the MNH instrument
described above. Since PHe slowly decreases with time in the ex situ
method, with a τ of approximately 50–200 h, the 3He cell must be
periodically exchanged with another polarized 3He cell for long experiments.
For the experiments, we prepared two cells, Karigane and Chidori
with the same size (ϕ45 mm × 75 mm) and 3He gas pressure of 3.1
atm [32]. The sample was a single crystal of Fe0.08Co0.92 with a diameter
of 10 mm and length of 18 mm. Six CeBr3 γ-ray detectors were used to
measure the prompt γ-rays from Co as the emitter.
Although magnet devices such as those shown in Fig. 4 can sufficiently
saturate the magnetization of the sample, Pn is easily depolarized
upstream of the sample if the guide magnetic fields are not smoothly
connected between the 3He spin filter and the sample. Therefore, the
connection of the magnetic fields in the MNH instruments (Figs. 6 and 7)
was confirmed by measuring the magnetic fields along the beam pass
using a Gaussmeter immediately before the measurements. Moreover,
we confirmed that the neutron polarization was maintained by
measuring 200 Bragg reflections of Fe0.08Co0.92 using the neutron PSDs
at a scattering angle of approximately 90◦ just before the start of the
MNH experiments. For the Bragg reflections of ferromagnetic samples
using polarized neutrons, the intensity can be represented as follows:
I± ∝|FN|2 +|FM|2 ± 2PnFNFM (7)
where FN and FM are the nuclear and magnetic structure factors,
respectively. The sign ± means that the neutron spins are parallel (+) or
antiparallel (􀀀 ) to the magnetization of the sample. The neutron spin
direction can be changed by flipping the 3He spins (red arrow in Fig. 6).
Note that for 200 Bragg reflection of Fe0.08Co0.92, FN(200) ≈ FM(200) is
realized. Therefore, I±(200) is considerably different when Pn ≈ 1, while
the flipping does not change I±(200) if Pn = 0 in the sample.
Fig. 8 shows the spin dependence of the intensity of the 200 Bragg
reflections of Fe0.08Co0.92 obtained using the instrument shown in Fig. 7.
The En at 200 Bragg reflections was approximately 13 meV (λ ~ 2.5 Å).
The intensity changed with the spin direction, indicating that the
developed instruments could maintain their polarization at En = 13
meV. For the present setting of the instruments on BL10, we could not
confirm polarization in the higher energy region. In polarized neutron
diffraction experiments on other diffractometer in J-PARC using the
same magnetic cavity and a similar guide magnetic field alignment with
the MNH experiments on BL10, it was confirmed that neutrons were
polarized at En = 56 meV (λ = 1.24 Å) [44]. Therefore, even in the

spins of 3He and neutrons. The black arrow in the device indicates the direction

present MNH experiment on BL10, it is probable that neutrons up to 56
meV were polarized.
From the flipping ratio I+/I􀀀 in Fig. 8, Pn was estimated to be 0.46 at
200 Bragg reflections (En ~ 13 meV), at which Pn > 0.95 can be expected,
as shown in Fig. 1, indicating that some depolarization occurred.
Since the magnetization of the sample was thought to be sufficient as
shown in Fig. 5, it is highly probable that the depolarization occurred in
the upstream region of the magnet device owing to zero or weak magnetic
fields. This will be discussed in the next section. In spite of the
depolarization, since the χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k) = 2PnχM(k) obtained under
these conditions is 0.92 χM(k), the MNH experiments to obtain χM(k) are
still feasible.
After the 200 Bragg measurements of Fe0.08Co0.92 shown in Fig. 8, we
began the MNH experiments. We repeated the MNH measurements three
times using Karigane, followed by two additional measurements using
Chidori after each cell installations to enhance the statistics, alternating
between the up- and down-spin conditions. Since one set of measurements
needs about 16 h, total measurement time was approximately 80
h. PHe was determined by fitting the neutron energy dependence of the
ratio Tn(PHe)/ Tn(PHe = 0), where Tn(PHe) and Tn(PHe = 0) are the
transmittances through the 3He spin filter in the polarized and unpolarized
states respectively. At the beginning of the experiments, PHe =
0.71 for the Karigane cell and 0.62 for the Chidori cell, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 1, a Pn of over 0.6 can be expected in the energy range of
10–200 meV. The relaxation of PHe was monitored using AFP -NMR
measurements during the experiments. Fig. 9 shows the time dependence
of PHe determined by AFP-NMR and the neutron transmission, Tn
(eq. (3)), of Karigane and Chidori. The relaxation time τ of Karigane was
estimated to be 106.1 ± 0.3 h by exponential fitting to the NMR data
(dashed line). On the other hand, the τ value of Chidori could not be
estimated accurately because we measured NMR and Tn only two and
three times, respectively. However, as shown in Fig. 9, the time
dependence of Tn for Chidori (black open circles) is slower than that of
Karigane, indicating that τ for Chidori is longer than that for Karigane.
The estimated τ value for Chidori was approximately 150 h. These τ
values are longer than the typical measurement time of 8 h for one
measurement of the parallel/antiparallel spin states in the present experiments,
meaning that the time dependence of PHe during one measurement
is not a serious problem. As the first step, we assumed that PHe
during a set of measurements of the parallel and antiparallel spin states
(~16 h) is constant, although the decrease in PHe over the first 8 h is
~0.05, which is not negligible. Countermeasures to address the loss of
data reliability owing to the time dependence of PHe are discussed in the
next section. Moreover, to minimize this effect, the data were obtained
in the order of the sequence of up-down-down-up spin states in the
present experiments.
The γ-ray intensity was measured in the angular ranges of 0◦ ≤ ϕ ≤
360◦ and 0◦ ≤ ω ≤ 50◦. The maximum ω was much smaller than that of
standard NH experiments (ω ≤ 170◦) to avoid the shadow of the magnet
device, which blocks the incident beam during the rotation. In the
measurement, a γ-ray energy range between 150 and 350 keV was
recorded because relatively strong γ-rays from Co are expected at
approximately 250 keV, that is, at 230 and 277 keV. Thus, this range
guaranteed that Co was selected as the central element (emitter). The
ϕ–ω angles and intensity of the prompt γ-rays from Co were connected
by the event recording data acquisition system of J-PARC [45], which
provides the ϕ–ω angular dependence of the γ-ray intensity. Fig. 10(a)
shows the ϕ–ω intensity map at λ = 2.75 Å (En = 10.8 meV) of one
measurement of down spin state without any correction. λ = 2.75 Å is
the longest λ in the λ range used for the standard analysis. In Fig. 10(b),
which shows the ϕ dependence of the intensity at ω = 10◦, the downward
spike-like signals are not noise but are caused by the periodic
decrease in the incident neutron flux by the standard operation of the
accelerator in J-PARC, which can be removed in the analysis. As shown
in Fig. 10(a), the shadows caused by shielding against γ-rays by the
magnet device were observed as two black valleys in low ω region
because the neodymium magnets in the manet devise are located between
the sample and γ-ray detectors at around ϕ = 60◦ and 240◦. On
the other hand, for ω > 40◦, white ridges are observed, which are
thought to originate from Compton scattering of γ-rays from boron,
which is a strong emitter of prompt γ-rays, in the neodymium magnets
because the incident neutron beam slightly hits the neodymium magnets
in the higher ω region. Moreover, γ-rays caused by the irradiation of
neutron Bragg reflections to the shields surrounding the detectors did
not affect the data because no obvious peaks or structures, except the

black valleys, are observed in Fig. 10.
It should be noted that most of the intensity in Fig. 10 is not hologram
signals but the intensity of γ-ray generated from Co in Fe0.08Co0.92
other than hologram signals. Since the shadows of the magnet device
have the same effect on the hologram signals and other γ-rays, the hologram
signals can be normalized by the total intensity of γ-rays from Co.
Since the effect of the shadows of the magnet device on the intensity is
not very steep (Fig. 10(b)), the total intensity of γ-rays from Co can be
determined by some combinations of polynomial functions for the ϕ
dependence of the intensity at each ω angle. The intensity map was
normalized and flattened using the determined polynomial functions.
Through this process, the effect of the shadows of the magnet device can
be basically corrected. Subtracting one from the normalized intensity
maps results in hologram signals oscillating around zero. The holograms
of the up and down spins in the range 0◦ ≤ ω ≤ 50◦ can be transformed
into the full sphere holograms (0◦ ≤ ω≤ 180◦) χ±(k) using the four-fold
and mirror symmetry operations of Fe0.08Co0.92 (space group: Fm3m).
Fig. 11(a) and (b) are χ+(k) and χ􀀀 (k) at En = 32 meV (λ = 1.59 Å),
respectively. Geometric patterns were observed in the holograms along
the [100] and [010] directions., which are slightly different in χ+(k) and
χ􀀀 (k). From χ±(k), χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k) can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 11(c)
and (d). Comparing χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k), the obvious four-fold symmetric
patterns in χ+(k) + χ􀀀 (k) disappear in χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k), while some geometric
patterns are still observed in χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k). The changes of the
patterns imply that nuclear components were subtracted in χ+(k) 􀀀
χ􀀀 (k). However, though we attempted to visualize magnetic images
using Batron’s equation (eq. (6)) using χ+(k) 􀀀 χ􀀀 (k), reliable images
were not obtained at expected positions of Fe/Co around the emitter Co,
yet. Possible reasons include insufficient statistics, limited ω angle, depolarization,
and the time dependence of PHe. The reasons and ways to
overcome these issues are discussed in the next section.
8. Technical problems
In this section, we discuss the reasons for the lack of success in
visualizing the nuclear and magnetic images in the present MNH
experiments.
First, the statistic required for MNH is discussed. As shown in Fig. 10
(b), raw counts in a pixel in the ϕ–ω map is 200 counts at λ = 2.75 Å
measured by one detector in one measurement. Although the required
statistic for reliable visualization of atomic images by NH/MNH is
strongly dependent on the experimental conditions and symmetry of the
samples, based on a comparison with experiments of successful image
reconstructions, for instance, 2% Sm doped YbB6 with space group of
Pm3m [26], we believe that the statistics of the present MNH experiments
is basically sufficient for visualization.
Next, the time dependence of PHe is discussed. Since we measured the
data using the ex situ method in the first stage, PHe decreased with time
during one measurement. Although in the analysis, we assumed that the
time dependence during a measurement (~8 h) can be neglected, the
decrease in PHe for 8 h is ~0.05, which is not negligible for an accurate
analysis. The decay of PHe interferes with the visualization. The best
approach to overcome this is measurements by the in situ method, in
which PHe is stabilized by continuous laser pumping. Since other

technical problems with MNH were identified in the present experiments,
the in situ method can be used in the second stage. In addition, a
compact in situ SEOP system is now being developed at J-PARC, which
can be installed in the limited space of MNH experiments on BL10.
Subsequently, the effect of a limited ω-range is discussed. In the
present MNH experiments, the upper limit of ω was 50◦ to prevent the
incident beam from hitting the neodymium magnets, while the standard
upper limits of XFH and NH is 70◦ and 170◦, respectively. In ARH, it is
well known that a limited ω-range affects the reliability of the reconstructed
atomic images. For example, for a Ge δ-layer buried in Si(001),
atomic images of Si reconstructed from data in 60◦ ≤ ω ≤ 90◦ is
anisotropically elongated along the [001] direction [46]. Since such
broadening makes the image difficult to observe, an expansion of
ω-range is necessary, at least up to 70◦. To overcome this, a magnet
device with a smaller dead angle by neodymium magnets, in which the
neodymium magnets and the sample should not be in direct contact, is
effective.
Finally, the cause of the depolarization from Pn >0.95 to 0.46, as
determined by the measurements of the 200 Bragg reflection in Fig. 8 is
discussed. Since the magnet device can apply a sufficient magnetic field
to the sample, the cause of the depolarization is an incomplete
connection of the guide magnetic field around the magnet device. To
confirm this, we prepared an off-beam setting of the same guide magnet
coils and the magnet device as in the MNH experiment on BL10 and
measured the guide magnetic fields along the beam direction using a 3D
Gaussmeter. Fig. 12 shows the positional dependence of the 3D magnetic
fields at the beam center in the upstream region of the magnet device at
(a) ω = 0◦ and ϕ = 0◦, (b) ω = 25◦ and ϕ = 0◦, (c) ω = 50◦ and ϕ = 0◦, and
(d) ω = 25◦ and ϕ = 90◦. The origin of the horizontal axis is at the center
of the magnet device. The z direction is defined as the beam direction,
and the x and y directions are defined as the horizontal and vertical
directions perpendicular to the beam, respectively. The closed circles,
open squares, triangles, and red solid line shown in Fig. 12 represent the
x, y, and z components of the magnetic field (Bx, By, and Bz), and the
total magnetic field (Btot =
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
B2x
+ B2y
+ B2z
√
), respectively. As shown in
Fig. 12, the main component in most area is Bz (blue arrows in Fig. 6),
which is farther than 4 cm from the magnet device, and the direction of
the magnetic field is almost parallel to the beam direction. In contrust,
there exists a minimum of Btot at approximately 2 cm, that is, in the gap
between the magnet device and the guide coils. In particular, in Fig. 12
(d), at ω = 25◦ and ϕ = 90◦, Bz becomes zero at 2.5 cm and is reversed
near the magnet device. The directions of Bx, and By are also reversed at
the same point. Consequently, the minimum value of Btot approaches
zero at 2 cm. Moreover, in the region less than 2 cm from the magnet
device, the maximum component is replaced by changing ω and ϕ,
indicating that the direction of the magnetic field near the magnet device
changes in complex ways by changing ω and ϕ. Therefore, the depolarization
shown in Fig. 8 is caused by the areas with zero magnetic
field and complicated changes in the direction of the magnetic field just
before the sample. Moreover, because the depolarization by these effects
is more severe in higher energy regions, the energy range that can be
used for visualization is limited. This reduces the accuracy of atomic
magnetic images. This could be the main reason of for the difficulty in
reproducing magnetic images.
It is highly probable that the insufficient connection of the guide
magnetic field is caused by the return magnetic field generated by the
neodymium magnets in the magnet device shown in Figs. 3 and 4(a)
because the return magnetic field around the neodymium magnets is in
the opposite direction of the magnetic field inside the magnet device and
the magnetization of the sample. Therefore, it is effective to avoid direct
contact between the magnet and the sample, and to keep the magnet and
sample as far apart as possible while maintaining sufficient magnetization
of the sample. The development of such magnet devices is in
dispensable for realizing MNH.
9. Summary
We developed instrumentation for the first magnetic neutron holography
measurements using polarized white neutrons, which we will
use to investigate the local magnetic structures of magnetic alloys at JPARC.
Using a magnet device to saturate the magnetization of the
samples and a 3He spin filter based on the spin-exchange optical
pumping technique, we polarized the neutron beams in the energy range
of 10–600 meV. We confirmed that the Pn in the room-temperature
ferromagnetic alloy Fe0.08Co0.92 using the developed equipment is
0.46 at a neutron wavelength of 2.5 Å by measuring the flipping ratio of
200 Bragg reflections. Under these conditions, we obtained preliminary
holograms of χ+(k) ± χ􀀀 (k). Though reliable atomic/magnetic images

could not be reconstructed yet, we found that the primary reasons
include the imperfect connection of the guide magnetic field, limited
ω-range, and time dependence of PHe. The technical problems of MNH
and ways to overcome them were identified in the present first-stage
experiments, indicating that MNH at J-PARC is still promising and will
be feasible in the near future. In the second stage, MNH experiments
involving room-temperature ferromagnetic alloys using the in situ
method are in preparation at J-PARC.
