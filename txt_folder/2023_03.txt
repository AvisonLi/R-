Human acetyltransferases MOZ and MORF are implicated in chromosomal
translocations associated with aggressive leukemias. Oncogenic translocations
involve the far amino terminus of MOZ/MORF, the function of which
remains unclear. Here, we identified and characterized two structured winged
helix (WH) domains, WH1 and WH2, in MORF and MOZ. WHs bind DNA in a
cooperative manner, with WH1 specifically recognizing unmethylated CpG
sequences. Structural and genomic analyses show that the DNA binding
function of WHs targets MORF/MOZ to gene promoters, stimulating transcription
and H3K23 acetylation, andWH1 recruits oncogenic fusions to HOXA
genes that trigger leukemogenesis. Cryo-EM, NMR, mass spectrometry and
mutagenesis studies provide mechanistic insight into the DNA-binding
mechanism, which includes the association of WH1 with the CpG-containing
linker DNA and binding of WH2 to the dyad of the nucleosome. The discovery
of WHs in MORF and MOZ and their DNA binding functions could open an
avenue in developing therapeutics to treat diseases associated with aberrant
MOZ/MORF acetyltransferase activities.
Fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells are commonly regulated
through covalent modifications of DNA and posttranslational modifications
(PTMs) of proteins. One of the canonical PTMs associated
with transcriptionally active chromatin is acetylation of lysine residues
of histones1,2. Acetylation removes the positive charge from the lysine
side chain, weakening electrostatic contacts between histones and
DNA, relaxing chromatin, and making DNA more accessible. Acetyllysine
also serves as a docking site for numerous proteins and

complexes essential in gene transcription and DNA damage repair3. In
mammals, acetylation is catalyzed by lysine acetyltransferase (KAT)
complexes, including the MYST (Moz, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60) family
of KATs. Among five members of the MYST family are the MOZ
(monocytic leukemic zinc-finger protein) complex and the MORF
(MOZ-related factor) complex4,5. The MOZ/MORF complexes play critical
roles in embryogenesis, development, hematopoiesis, skeletogenesis,
and cellular senescence and are involved in chromosomal
translocations known to induce aggressive forms of blood cancer6–14.
Acute leukemias derived from oncogenic MOZ/MORF translocations
and aberrant acetyltransferase activities are associated with poor
prognosis and grim survival rates, prompting and accelerating the
development of inhibitors for MOZ/MORF with several already showing
promising results as anti-cancer therapeutics15,16. PathogenicMOZ/
MORF have also been linked to developmental disorders, epilepsy, and
intellectual disability17–20.
The MOZ/MORF complexes acetylate primarily lysine 23 of histone
H3 (H3K23ac) and contain four subunits7,21,22. A bromodomain
PHD finger protein 1 (BRPF1) forms a scaffold for the assembly of other
three subunits—the catalytic subunit MOZ/MORF, also known as
KAT6A/KAT6B, inhibitor of growth 4/5 (ING4/5), and MYST/Esa1-
associated factor 6 (MEAF6). The catalytic MOZ/MORF subunits are
large, 2004/2073-amino acid proteins characterized by similar domain
architecture. Both contain a double PHD finger (DPF) that recognizes
acylated lysine 14 of histone H3 (H3K14acyl), the catalytic MYST
domain, and the ED (glutamate/aspartate-rich) and SM (serine/
methionine-rich) regions that were proposed to have a role in transcriptional
activation23–29 (Fig. 1a). Genetic and biochemical studies
have shown that binding of the DPF domain to H3K14ac contributes to
chromatin targeting by MOZ/MORF23,24. It stimulates H3K23 acetylation,
activating gene transcription, and there is a positive crosstalk
between H3K23ac and H3K14ac at the genomic sites occupied by
MORF21. The functional importance of other regions of MOZ/MORF,
beyond the DPF and MYST domains, particularly their N-termini,
remains unclear.
In this study, we identified and characterized the tandem winged
helix (WH) domains of MORF (MORFWH1 and MORFWH2) and MOZ
(MOZWH1 and MOZWH2). We show that both WHs bind DNA but select
for distinctive sequences, with MORF/MOZWH1 being highly specific
toward unmethylated CpG. DNA binding function of WHs is required
for the recruitment of MORF/MOZ to target gene promoters and
H3K23 acetylation. Together, our structural, biochemical and in vivo
findings reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which a
tandem of WH domains binds to the nucleosome, mediating the
association of the major human acetyltransferases with specific
genomic loci and their enzymatic functions.
Results and discussion
MORF and MOZ contain two DNA-binding winged helix (WH)
domains
We have previously shown that DPF of MORF (MORFDPF) associates
with H3K14acyl and DNA, however, its low μMbindingaffinity suggests
that this domain is not a major driver for the recruitment of the large
MORF protein to chromatin. Searching for uncharacterized regions of
MORF that could contribute to binding to chromatin, we explored the
N-terminus of MORF (aa 1–182 of MORF, MORF182). Dispersion of
amide resonances in 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) NMR spectrum of 15N-labeled MORF182 indicated that this
region is folded (Fig. 1b). Shorter constructs, generated by splitting
MORF182 in two halves, retained the fold, and their 1H,15N HSQC spectra
overlaid very well with the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of MORF182. These
results suggest that MORF182 is comprised of two independent folded
domains that have similar chemical environments either as linked or
isolated modules and therefore likely do not interact with each other.
We identified the first half of MORF182 as a winged helix 1 (MORFWH1)
and the second half as a winged helix 2 (MORFWH2) based on the data
described below, and from here on refer to them as MORFWHs.
To determine whether MORFWHs are capable of binding to DNA,
we examined the association of MORFWH1 and MORFWH2 with 147 bp
601 Widom DNA (DNA147) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA). DNA147 was incubated with increasing amounts of MORFWH1
and MORFWH2 and the reaction mixtures were resolved on native
polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1c, d). A gradual increase in the amounts of
added MORFWH1 and MORFWH2 caused a shift of the DNA147 band and
the appearance of several bands corresponding to the complexes
formed between MORFWH1 and MORFWH2 and multiple major/minor
grooves30 of DNA147. The binding to DNA147 was confirmed by NMR
titration experiments. Upon addition of DNA147, amide crosspeaks of
MORFWH2 broadened beyond detection due to the formation of large
MORFWH2-DNA147 complexes (Supplementary Fig. 1).
A high degree similarity of amino acid sequences between MORF
and homologous MOZ suggested that MOZ also contains two
N-terminal WHs, MOZWH1, and MOZWH2 (Fig. 1e). Indeed, the dispersion
of amide resonances in 1H,15N HSQC spectra of MOZWH1 and
MOZWH2 pointed to the presence of independent folded modules
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). BothMOZWH1 andMOZWH2 readily shifted the
DNA147 band in EMSA, confirming that the DNA binding activity is
conserved in MORF and MOZ (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
MORFWHs are required for MORF recruitment to chromatin and
H3K23 acetylation
Are MORFWHs essential for biological functions of MORF? We investigated
the role ofMORFWHs in genomic occupancy ofMORF andMORFdependent
H3K23 acetylation in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments (Fig. 1f–h and Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Human K562 cells expressing FLAG-taggedMORFN (aa 1–716 ofMORF,
containing MORFWH1, MORFWH2, MORFDPF and MORFMYST), wild type
(WT) or mutants in which MORFWH1 (MORFN ΔWH1), MORFWH2
(MORFN ΔWH2) or both MORFWHs (MORFN ΔWH1-WH2) are deleted,
were generated and used to measure MORFN, H3K23ac and H3K14ac
levels at promoters of a set of target genes. Compared to the binding
of WT MORFN, lossofMORFWH1 substantially decreased the binding of
MORFN to promoters of all genes tested, and while loss of MORFWH2
had a milder impact, deletion of both MORFWHs had a cumulative
effect in disrupting the recruitment of MORFN to chromatin (Fig. 1f).
Furthermore, expression ofMORFN with bothMORFWHs being deleted
led to a decrease in the level of H3K23 acetylation at these promoters
compared to the H3K23ac level observed upon expression of WT
MORFN, with the loss ofMORFWH1 resulting in a more notable change
than the loss of MORFWH2 (Fig. 1g). As expected, H3K14ac level was
reduced by the deletion of MORFWHs to a lesser extent than the
H3K23ac level and was essentially unaffected by the deletion of
MORFWH2 (Fig. 1h). Together, these data demonstrate that both functional
MORFWH1 and MORFWH2 are required for MORF to occupy its
target genes and acetylate H3K23 in vivo.
MORFWH2 binds DNA via its α3 and α2 helices
To gain insight into the DNA binding mechanisms of MORFWHs, we
assessed the minimal size of DNA to which these domains can bind.
EMSA experiments using increasing amounts of MORFWH1 and
MORFWH2 and a 10 bp to 100 bpDNAladder revealed that either domain
interacts with a double-stranded DNA at least or larger than 15 bp in
length (Supplementary Fig. 4). In support, GST-MORFWH2 immobilized
onto glutathione sepharose beads pulled down fluorescein (FAM)-
labeled 37 bp dsDNA (FAM-DNA37) in a confocal microscopy assay
(Fig. 2a), and a 15 bp A-rich dsDNA (A-DNA15) induced chemical shift
perturbations (CSPs) in 15N-labeled MORFWH2 in 1H,15N HSQC titration
experiments (Fig. 2b). To identify residues of MORFWH2 responsible for
binding to DNA, we collected and analyzed triple resonance NMR
spectra of uniformly 13C,15N-labeled MORFWH2 and assigned backbone

amide resonances. In solution, A-DNA15 induced CSPs primarily in two
regions, encompassing residues L126-I129 and R151-R158 of MORFWH2
(Fig. 2c). We then determined the three-dimensional solution NMR
structure of MORFWH2 and mapped themost perturbed residues onto
the structure (Fig. 2d). The structure revealed a winged helix fold
consisting of three α-helices, a double-stranded β-sheet, one short wing
connecting two β-strands, and an additional α2’-helix is present
between α2 and α3 (Fig. 2d–f and Supplementary Table 1).

positively charged patch of the domain that could electrostatically
interact with the negatively charged DNA (Fig. 2e). We mutated K127
and K131 in the α2 helix and separately R151, R153, K157 and R158 in the
α3 helix to alanine and tested thesemutants in EMSA (Fig. 2f, g).While
the K127A/K131A MORFWH2 mutant retained a weak DNA binding
ability, binding of the R151A/R153A/K157A/R158A MORFWH2 mutant to
DNA147 was abolished, indicating that both α2 andα3 arenecessary for
the strong interaction with DNA, with the α3 helix ofMORFWH2 being
critical. We note that R151, K157, and R158 of MORFWH2 are found
mutated in adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma and breast and
stomach cancers (Cosmic).
MORFWH1 selects for CpG-rich DNA
To assess whether MORFWHs recognize specific DNA sequences, we
tested them in universal oligonucleotide arrays that contain all
possible combinations of 10 bp sequences within ~44,000 60-bp
probes31,32. As shown in Fig. 3a, MORFWH2 has a slight preference for
an AT-rich DNA sequence. This minor selectivity of MORFWH2
was confirmed by EMSA with A-DNA15 and a 15 bp C-rich dsDNA
(C-DNA15) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). Quantitative analysis
of EMSAs yielded a 7.8 μM binding affinity of MORFWH2 to A-DNA15
and a two-fold weaker binding affinity of MORFWH2 to C-DNA15
(Kd=18 μM) (Fig. 3c, d). Methylation of cytosine did not affect binding,
as MORFWH2 associated with unmethylated 16 bp CpG dsDNA
(CpG-DNA16) and methylated CpG-DNA16 (mCpG-DNA16) equally
well (Fig. 3b).
In contrast, MORFWH1 bound specifically to the CpG-rich DNA
sequences and did not recognize the AT-rich sequences in universal
oligonucleotide arrays and EMSA (Fig. 3e, f). The dissociation constant
for the interaction of MORFWH1 with CpG-DNA16 was found to
be 2 μM, however this interaction was substantially diminished by
methylation of the CpG motif (Fig. 3f, g). A computational model of
MORFWH1 suggested a winged three-helix fold; however the α3 helix,
which contains a set of DNA-interacting lysine and arginine residues
in MORFWH2, does not contain the positively charged residues in
MORFWH1 and therefore likely does not mediate binding ofMORFWH1
to DNA. Instead, electrostatic surface potential of this model shows
two positively charged regions encompassing the α1 helix, the loop
connecting α1 and α2 and the loop connecting two β-strands in the
β-hairpin (Fig. 3h). The model of MORFWH1 superimposes with the
crystal structure of WH from SAMD1 (rmsd of 0.6 Å) (Fig. 3i), an
atypical WH that binds to DNA by a mechanism distinctly different
from that of typical WHs33. While the C-terminal end of α1 helix and
the loop connecting α1 and α2 in SAMD1 WH insert in the CpGcontaining
major groove of DNA, the atypically long β-hairpin
inserts into a neighboring minor groove of DNA33. The overlay with
the SAMD1 WH structure suggested that MORFWH1 has a similar
mode of binding to DNA (Fig. 3i). To test this, we generated the
K19A/K21A/K22A mutant of MORFWH1, harboring mutations in α1,
and the K24A/R26A/K66A mutant of MORFWH1, harboring mutations
in the loops, and evaluated binding of these mutants to DNA147 by
EMSA (Fig. 3j, k). We found that mutation of K24, R26, and K66
completely disrupts binding of MORFWH1 to DNA147 and mutation of
K19, K21 and K22 substantially decreases this interaction. In agreement,
NMR titration experiments showed that wild-type MORFWH1
tightly binds to CpG-DNA16, exhibiting CSPs in the intermediate
exchange regime on the NMR time scale (Fig. 3l and Supplementary
Fig. 5), however the ability to bind CpG-DNA16 was lost by the K24A/
R26A/K66A mutant of MORFWH1 or notably reduced by the K19A/
K21A/K22A mutant of MORFWH1 (Fig. 3m, n and Supplementary
Fig. 5). Collectively, NMR and EMSA results suggest that similar to
the DNA binding mode of atypical WH from SAMD1, the two loops
and α1 of MORFWH1 mediate binding to DNA and that the DNA
binding mechanism of MORFWH1 differs from the DNA binding
mechanism of the typical MORFWH2.
MOZWH1 targets CpG genome wide
Analysis of DNA binding selectivity ofMOZWH1 andMOZWH2 in universal
oligonucleotide PBMarrays revealed that, similar toMORFWHs,MOZWH1
specifically binds to the CpG-rich DNA sequences and MOZWH2 shows
essentially no sequence selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 2c). We examined
genomic localization of endogenous full-length MOZ (MOZFL) and
a series of exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged shorter MOZ constructs,
including MOZWH1, MOZWH2-DPF, andMOZWH1-WH2-DPF in human
HEK293T cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep
sequencing (ChIP-seq). Analysis of ChIP-seq showed that the genomewide
occupancy of MOZWH1 centered around the transcription start
sites (TSS) and correlated well with the distribution of unmethylated
CpG, which was identified by CpG island recovery assay for unmethylated
CpGs coupled with deep sequencing (CIRA-seq), as well as with
non-phosphorylated RNAP2 (Fig. 4a, b). The ChIP signal intensities of
MOZWH1 correlated with the signal intensities of MOZFL (r=0.92) and
unmethylated CpG (r=0.86) (Fig. 4c, d). In HEK293T cells, ~89% (11,021
out of 12,386) of the MOZFL-bound genes overlapped with ~97% (11,021
out of 11,381) of the MOZWH1-bound genes, and ~87% (10,840 out of
12,587) of the unmethylated CpG-enriched genes overlapped with ~96%
(10,840 out of 11,381) of the MOZWH1-bound genes (Fig. 4e). Loss of
MOZWH1 resulted in a relatively non-specific chromatin association of
MOZWH2-DPF (Fig. 4a, b) and only ~14% of the MOZFL-bound genes and
~12% of the unmethylated CpG-enriched genes were co-occupied by
MOZWH2-DPF (Fig. 4f). No correlation was observed between the ChIP/
CIRA signals of MOZWH2-DPF and MOZFL (r = −0.06) and unmethylated
CpG (r = −013) (Fig. 4g, h). Co-occupancy with unmethylated CpG sites
however was restored for MOZWH1-WH2-DPF (Fig. 4a, b). The high degree
correlation between the ChIP/CIRA signals of MOZWH1-WH2-DPF and
MOZFL (r = 0.87) and unmethylated CpG (r = 0.84) mirrored the correlation
between MOZFL and unmethylated CpG (r = 0.88) (Fig. 4i–k). We
noticed a moderate enrichment ofMOZFL andMOZWH2-DPF downstream
of TSS (Fig. 4a, b). The ChIP signal intensity of H3K14ac also increased
downstream of TSS, suggesting that binding of MOZDPF to H3K14ac in
transcribed regions contributes to the association of MOZ with chromatin
(Fig. 4a, b). Together, the ChIP-seq and CIRA-seq data demonstrate
that MOZWH1 targets MOZ to unmethylated CpG-rich regions,
whereas the MOZDPF-H3K14ac interaction can provide additional
anchoring in transcribed regions.
MOZ/MORFWH1 is required for binding of MOZ/MORF to
target genes
The positive correlation between MOZWH1 or MOZWH1-WH2-DPF levels
and unmethylated CpG levels at TSS was also observed at individual
genes, such as the HOXA family, MYC and CDKN2C (Fig. 5a). The distribution
pattern ofMOZWH1 andMOZWH1-WH2-DPFwas similar to that of
MOZFL and other components of theMOZ complex, ING4 andMEAF6,
and replicated the distribution of unmethylated CpG in gene promoters,
including promoters of oncogenic HOXA9 and MYC, known to
induce leukemogenesis. Loss of MOZWH1 led to a non-specific binding
ofMOZWH2-DPF throughout the genomic regions tested, supporting the
notion that the major determinant of genomic occupancy of MOZ is
MOZWH1, which binds unmethylated CpG-rich promoters.
Occupancy of MORFWH1 at the promoter regions mirrored occupancy
of MOZWH1 (Fig. 5b). The localization patterns of MORFWH1 and
MOZWH1 at the leukemic oncogenes HOXA9 and MYC were nearly
identical (Fig. 5c). ChIP-qPCR analysis confirmed that MORFWH1 specifically
occupies the promoters ofMYC and HOXA9, whereas theK19A/
K21A/K22A and K24A/R26A/K66A mutants of MORFWH1, defective in
unmethylated CpG binding (Fig. 3 j, k, m, n) were unable to localize to
the specific genomic sites (Fig. 5d). These results indicate that recognition
of the CpG sequence by WH1 is conserved in MORF and MOZ
and is required for binding to chromatin in vivo.
One of the chromosomal translocations directly linked to the
development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the fusion of MOZ

with a transcriptional co-activator TIF2 (Fig. 6a), which in turn associates
with another co-activator, CPB/p30034–36. As shown in Fig. 5a,
MOZ-TIF2 co-localized with endogenous MOZFL, unmethylated CpGs,
MOZWH1 and MOZWH1-WH2-DPF at the same gene promoters, indicating
that MOZWH1 drives the recruitment of the leukemogenic MOZ-TIF2
chimera to chromatin. To further characterize this recruitment, we
tested occupancy of MOZFL, MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-TIF2 ΔWH1 at the
target genes MYC, HOXA9, and CDKN2C, as well as negative control
CD4, by ChIP-qPCR (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). MOZFL and
MOZ-TIF2 showed similar chromatin binding patterns within all three
regions tested, whereas the deletion of MOZWH1 abolished chromatin
binding activity of MOZ-TIF2 ΔWH1 (Fig. 6b). Recruitment of the
MORF-TIF2 fusion to chromatin also depended on MORFWH1 because
MORF-TIF2 ΔWH1 was unable to bind to the MYC, HOXA9, and CDKN2C

genes (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 3b).Mutations inMORFWH2 that
impair its DNA binding (R151A/R153A/K157A/R158A) reduced the genespecific
localization of MORF-TIF2 WH2-mutant compared to localization
of MORF-TIF2. Much like MORF-TIF2 ΔWH1, MORF-TIF2
ΔWH1 + R151A/R153A/K157A/R158A mutant completely lost its ability
to associate with MYC, HOXA9 and CDKN2C genes (Fig. 6c), confirming
that this region is indispensable for the retention of MOZ/MORF-TIF2
at chromatin.
MOZ/MORFWH1 is essential in leukemogenicity of MOZ/
MORF-TIF2
To determine the role of WHs in leukemogenic activity of the MOZ/
MORF-TIF2 fusions, we performed myeloid progenitor transformation
assay, in which c-Kit positive hematopoietic progenitors were transduced
with the MOZ fusions (MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-TIF2 ΔWH1) and the
MORF counterparts (MORF-TIF2, MORF-TIF2 ΔWH1, the MORF-TIF2
MORFWH2 mutant, and MORF-TIF2 ΔWH1 +MORFWH2 mutant) and
cultured in a semi-solid media ex vivo (Fig. 6d). Consistent with their
chromatin binding abilities (Fig. 6b, c), MORF-TIF2 ΔWH1 and MOZTIF2
ΔWH1, in which WH1 was deleted, failed to activate Hoxa9 gene
expression and immortalize hematopoietic progenitors, a characteristic
feature of oncogenic MOZ fusions (Fig. 6e, f). These results indicate
thatWH1 is a critical chromatin targetingmodule for theMOZ and
MORF fusions and is necessary for leukemogenesis. The inactivating
mutation of MORFWH2 modestly hampered Hoxa9 expression in the
second passage in cells transduced with the MORF-TIF2 MORFWH2
mutant compared to the cells transduced with wild-type MORF-TIF2
(Fig. 6e). The MORF-TIF2 MORFWH2 mutant expressing cells gradually
lost their clonogenicities and failed to form colonies in the fourth
round passage, indicating that the intact MORFWH2 is required for the
full leukemogenicity of MORF-TIF2 (Fig. 6f). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that the WH1-mediated binding to unmethylated CpGrich
DNA is crucial for the oncogenic activity of the MOZ/MORF
fusions, and while WH2 also plays a role, it appears to be less drastic
than that of WH1.
Concomitant engagement ofMORFWHs augments binding to the
nucleosome
To characterize the DNA binding mechanism of WHs in detail, we
investigated the association of MORFWH1 and MORFWH2 with the
nucleosome core particle (NCP) by EMSA and fluorescence anisotropy
assays (Fig. 7a–i). For EMSA, we used nucleosomes containing a 147 bp
601 DNA (NCP147) and a 187bp 601 DNA (NCP187) and for fluorescence
anisotropy measurements, we reconstituted fluorescein-labeled
NCP147 and NCP207. NCP207 was generated using a 207 bp DNA in
which 147 bp 601DNA is flanked by 30 bp linkerDNA on either side and
internally labeled with fluorescein 27 bp in from the 5’ end. Both
MORFWH1 andMORFWH2 shifted the NCP147 and NCP187 bands in EMSA,
indicating the formation of the MORFWH1-NCP and MORFWH2-NCP
complexes (Fig. 7a, b, d, e). While the presence of an extranucleosomal
linker DNA in NCP187 increased the association of
MORFWH1, binding ofMORFWH2 was unaffected. In support, quantitative
measurements of binding affinities by fluorescence polarization
revealed that MORFWH2 does not discriminate between NCP147 and
NCP187 and interacts equallywell with either nucleosome (S1/2 = 1.0μM
and 1.4 μM, respectively) (Fig. 7c). These data suggest that MORFWH2
utilizes the samemechanism for binding to the nucleosome regardless
of the presence of extra-nucleosomal DNA fragments, still, the
nucleosome organization is essential because binding of MORFWH2 to
the nucleosomes was ~4–6-fold tighter than its binding to DNA147.
Titration ofMORFWH1 against NCP147 yielded a S1/2 of 9 μMfor the
MORFWH1-NCP147 complex formation, however MORFWH1 associated
30-fold tighter with NCP207 (S1/2=0.3μM), indicating its preference for
a linear, free of the nucleosome DNA (Fig. 7f). Binding affinity of
MORFWH1 to DNA147 (S1/2 = 15 μM) was only slightly weaker compared
to its binding affinity to NCP147 (S1/2=9 μM). The linked MORFWH1-WH2
construct exhibited affinities of 7 nM to NCP207, 12nM to NCP147, and
62nM to DNA147, which indicated a cooperative binding of two independent
MORFWHs (Fig. 7i) and similar behavior was observed for
MOZWH1-WH2 (Supplementary Fig. 6). The absence of CSPs in
15N-labeledMORFWH2 upon addition of unlabeledMORFWH1 confirmed
that the two MORFWHs do not interact (Fig. 7j and Supplementary
Fig. 7). In support of EMSA and NMR titration data (Fig. 3j–n), the
K24A/R26A/K66A and K19A/K21A/K22A mutants of MORFWH1 were
essentially incapable of binding to NCP147 (Fig. 7k).
MORFWH2 binds to the dyad of the nucleosome and MORFWH1
binds to the CpG linker DNA
To define the structural basis for the association of MORFWHs with
the nucleosome, we obtained a 7 Å resolution map of a 197 bp NCP
(NCP197) in complex with MORFWH1-WH2 by cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) (Fig. 8a, b). For reconstitution of NCP197 we used DNA197 in
which 147 bp Widom 601 DNA is flanked by two linker DNA fragments.
One linker contains three CpGs and another contains one
CpG. The formation of the MORFWH1-WH2-NCP197 complex was
monitored in EMSA. The cryo-EM map of the MORFWH1-WH2-NCP197-
scFv complex showed extra density near the nucleosome dyad
region. DNA and histones of the NCP197 structure (PDB ID: 7K5X) and
MORFWH2 were readily docked into the cryo-EM density map
(Fig. 8a, b and Supplementary Fig. 8). In addition to the density of
MORFWH2 at the NCP dyad, colored green in Fig. 8a, b, we observed
weaker extra density on the linker DNA around the C22, G23 DNA
sequence, colored blue. Excellent superimposition of the structure
of the CpG-bound atypical SAMD1 WH with the CpG (C22 and G23)
region of the cryo-EM structure suggested that this weaker extra
density belongs to MORFWH1 (Fig. 8c, d).
To verify the mechanism by which MORFWH1 recognizes CpGNCP197,
we tested wild-type MORFWH1 and the impaired in binding to
CpG-DNA16 mutants K19A/K21A/K22A and K24A/R26A/K66A in EMSA
(Fig. 8e and Supplementary Fig. 9).While wild typeMORFWH1 formed a
complex with NCP197, both mutants were unable to bind to the
nucleosome. These results are in agreement with the NMR data

described above for the interaction of MORFWH1 with CpG-DNA16
(Fig. 3), reinforcing the idea that the atypicalMORFWH1 requires intact
α1 and the two loops for its binding to CpG-NCP.
In contrast to MORFWH1, MORFWH2 is a typical WH that binds to
DNA through its α3 and α2 helices37. The structure of MORFWH2 aligns
well (rmsd of 0.9 Å) with the structures of H1 and H5, the linker histones
known to bind to the dyad of the nucleosome, decreasing
spontaneous DNA unwrapping or breathing of the nucleosome38–40.
We examined the impact of the MORFWH2 binding to the dyad on the
nucleosome dynamics and unwrapping-wrapping equilibrium by Förster
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)41. We prepared NCP273 using
273 bp DNA, which contains the 601 sequence flanked by 50/76 bp
linkers at the 5’/3’ ends without the CpG-binding site for MORFWH1 and
the Cy3 donor fluorophore positioned 54 bp from the 5’ end. The Cy5

acceptor fluorophore was attached to histone H2A(K119C) (Fig. 8f).
Titration of His-MORFWH1-WH2 into NCP273 led to an increase in FRET
efficiency, indicating stabilization of the wrapped state (Fig. 8g). We
concluded thatmuch like binding of linkerH1/H5, binding ofMORFWH2
to the nucleosome reduces DNA unwrapping. Altogether, cryo-EM,
FRET and EMSA results suggest a model for the cooperative association
of two independent DNA-binding domains of MORF with the
nucleosome, in which the typical MORFWH2 binds to the dyad of the
nucleosome, whereas the atypical MORFWH1 associates with the CpGcontaining
linker DNA.

MORFWH1 binding to the linker DNA increases HAT activity
The selectivity of MORFWH1 toward the extra-nucleosomal linker DNA
was observed in in vitro HAT assays. The native MORF complexes,
containing 3xFLAG-2xStrep tagged MORFN, WT or the deletion
mutants of MORFN (ΔWH1, ΔWH2, and ΔWH1/2), were affinity purified
from nuclear extracts of K562 cells, and acetyltransferase function of
these complexes was assessed on NCP147 and NCP207 (Fig. 9a and
Supplementary Fig. 11). The catalytic activity of the complex containingWT
MORFN was increased on the nucleosome with the linker DNA,
NCP207, compared to the activity of this complex on the nucleosome
without the linker DNA, NCP147. ThedeletionofMORFWH1 or bothWHs
abolished the selectivity of the MORFN complexes toward NCP207,
whereas the deletion of MORFWH2 had little effect on the selectivity.
These results imply that although both functional WHs are critical,

strong acetyltransferase activity of MORF depends on the interaction
of MORFWH1 with extra-nucleosomal DNA to a higher degree.
MORFWH2-DPF binding to DNA is modulated by auto-acetylation
MORF has been shown to be acetylated in the post-MYST region42. To
test whether MORF self-acetylates its N-terminus, we co-purified catalytically
activeMORFWH2-DPF-MYST and BRPF1 and assessed acetylation
by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). As control,
MORFWH2-DPF-MYST/BRPF1 was treated with the NAD+-dependent histone
deacetylase SIRT2 to remove acetylation. We found two autoacetylation
sites in MORFWH2-DPF-MYST, K167, located inMORFWH2 and
K182, located in the linker between MORFWH2 and MORFDPF (Fig. 9b).

MORFWH2-DPF to DNA147, the K167A mutation decreases it (Fig. 9f).
These data imply that autoacetylation of MORF can mediate its associationwith
chromatin. EMSA assays further showed thatMORFWH2-DPF
prefers the nucleosome with an extra-nucleosomal linker DNA, as
MORFWH2-DPF more readily forms the complex with NCP187 than with
NCP147 (Fig. 9g, h). These results highlight the ability of MORFWH1 and
MORFDPF, the two domains flanking MORFWH2, to select for the linear,
free of the nucleosome DNA.
In conclusion, in this study we identified a tandem of winged helix
domains, WH1 and WH2, in the N-terminal regions of the human
acetyltransferases MORF and MOZ. We found that both WHs interact
with DNA but display selectivity for distinct sequences and use dissimilar
mechanisms to engage DNA. The atypical WH1 binds exclusively
to unmethylated CpG sequences through its α1 and two loops,
whereas WH2 belongs to the family of typical WHs, has only a slight
preference for the AT sequences, and associates with DNA via α3 and
α2. In vivo data analyses reveal that the DNA binding of WHs (particularly
of WH1) is essential for the recruitment of MORF/MOZ to
promoters of target genes, stimulation of gene transcription and
H3K23 acetylation, and thus is vital to physiological functions of these
acetyltransferases. The WH1-mediated binding to unmethylated CpGislands
and the intactWH2 are also required for leukemogenic activity
of the MOZ and MORF fusions. These results suggest a strategy
directed at the inhibition of oncogenicMOZ andMORF translocations
through targeting their WHs.
Two MORFWHs are followed by MORFDPF that was shown to bind
H3K14acyl and DNA and the catalytic MORFMYST domain that acetylates
H3K2321,25. The multivalent contacts of the four sequentially
connected domains of MORF with DNA and histones and autoacetylation
of MORF point to an intricate mechanism by which MORF
targets specific sites and is activated there or inactivated when its
catalytic activity is no longer needed. Our structural and biochemical
findings suggest amodel for the engagement ofMORFwith chromatin,
in whichMORFWH1 binds to unmethylated CpG-containing linker DNA,
MORFWH2 occupies the dyad of the nucleosome, and MORFDPF interacts
with H3K14acyl and the linker DNA (Fig. 9i). How the combination
of these interactions stabilizes the MORF complex at chromatin and
how autoacetylation, intermolecular contacts, and the presence of
other subunits in the complex, such as ING4/5 and BRPF1 that recognize
H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and acetylated histones5,mediate function
of the MORF/MOZ complexes, require further investigation.

and lysed in buffer (1× PBS or 25–50mM Tris-HCl pH

glutathione agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Sci). The GST-tag was
cleaved with PreScission, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease or
Thrombin protease (MP Biomedicals) overnight or left on, and the
proteins were eluted off the resin with 50mM reduced L-glutathione
(Fisher). His-tag fusion proteins were purified using nickel–NTA resin
(ThermoFisher), the proteins were eluted from the resin with a gradient
of imidazole. The His-tag was either cleaved with TEV protease
during dialysis overnight at 4 °C or left on. When necessary, proteins
were further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and
concentrated in Millipore concentrators. His-SUMO-SIRT2 (aa 38–356)
was purified as described43. For protein expression in HEK293T cells,
cDNAs were obtained fromKazusa Genome Technologies Inc. or DNA
fragments were synthesized and cloned into the pMSCV (for retrovirus
production) or pCMV5 (for transient expression) vectors as
described13.
DNA purification
Double-stranded DNA containing the 601 Widom sequence cloned
into the pJ201 plasmid (147 bp) was transformed into DH5α cells. The
plasmids were purified either as previously described44 or by the
PureLink HiPure Expi Plasmid Gigaprep Kit (Invitrogen K210009XP).
Separation of the individual sequences was completed by digestion of
the plasmid with EcoRV followed by PEG and ethanol precipitation.
Short DNAs were either purchased as single-stranded DNA (IDT) and
annealed or ordered as pre-annealed double-stranded DNA (IDT).
Complimentary DNA strands were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio in
water in PCR tubes. Using a thermocycler to regulate temperature, the
samples were brought to 95 °C for 20min and then to 16 °C at a rate of
0.1 °C/s. All DNA samples were evaluated for purity by native polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis.
EMSA
Increasing amounts of WT ormutant (tagged or untagged) MORF and
MOZ proteins were incubated with DNA147 (0.1–0.25 pmol/lane, 601
Widom sequence), DNA15/16 (0.25–1.0 pmol/lane), DNAladder (25 ng/
lane) or NCP (0.5 pmol/lane) in buffer (20–25mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
20–150mM NaCl, 0–0.2mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
0–5mMDTT, and 0–20% glycerol) in a 10 μL reaction volume. For the
samples containing the DNA ladder (O’RangeRuler 5 bp DNA Ladder,
ThermoSci) the buffer was 25mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl.
Reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 10min (2.5 μl of loading
dye was added to each sample) and loaded onto a 5–10% native polyacrylamide
gel. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.2 × TBE buffer (1 ×
TBE = 90mMTris, 64.6mMboric acid, and 0–2mMEDTA) at80–130 V
on ice. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher) and visualized
by Blue LED (UltraThin LED Illuminator- GelCompany). Uncropped
gels are shown in the Source Data file.
Quantification of gel bands was performed using ImageJ using at
least three independent experiments. Kd values were determined using
a nonlinear least-squares analysis and the equation:

where [P] is the concentration of the MORF protein, [D] is the concentration
of DNA, ΔI is the observed change of band intensity, and
ΔImax is the difference in band intensity of the free DNA and DNA
bound by the protein. Kd values were averaged over at least three
separate experiments, and error was calculated as the standard
deviation between the runs.
Binding of His-MORFWH1, WT and mutants, to NCP197 was monitored
in buffer containing 10mMTris, 1mMEDTA, 10mMNaCl, 1mM
TCEP. 200 nM nucleosome was titrated with 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 2.0 μM

(replicate 1) or 1.6 μM (replicate 2) of His-MORFWH1. Reactions were
loaded on a 5% acrylamide gel and electrophoresis in 0.2 × TBE buffer
at 120 V and at 4 °C.
PBM experiments
Purified GST-MORFWH1 (aa 5–84), GST-MORFWH2 (aa 100–182), GSTMOZWH1
(aa 2–86), and GST-MOZWH2 (aa 92–177) were assayed at
300 nMfinal concentration in the PBMbinding reaction on 8x60K GSE
‘all 10-mer universal’ oligonucleotide arrays (AMADID #030236; Agilent
Technologies, Inc.), and proteins were detected using Alexa488
conjugated anti-GST antibody (Invitrogen A-11131) at a dilution of 1:40.
Double-stranding of the arrays and PBM experiments were otherwise
performed as described previously, and PBMdata were quantified and
analyzed using the PBM Universal Analysis Suite31,32.
Cell lines
Isogenic K562 cell lines expressing 3xFlag2xStrep-tagged MORFN WT
(aa 2–716), ΔWH1(aa 86–716), ΔWH2(aa 2–99 + aa 183–716) and ΔWH1/
2 (aa 183–716) were generated by integration at the AAVS1 safe harbor
locus after DSB induction and recombination targeted by cotransfection
with a ZFN expression plasmid, as previously
described45. The forwards primers for WT For 5′- atatagcggccgcttc

accATGGGGGCACCTCAGTATCCC were used with the Rev 5′- atatagg
ccggcCTCTTTCTCAGCTTCTCG. The MORF ΔWH2 (aa2–99 + 183–716)
was generated by PCR amplification of the WT MORF (aa2–716) using
For 5′- GGGGTCTAGAGGATCATGTGGGGCACCTC and Rev 5′- GAG
GTGCCCCACATGATCCTCTAGACCCC primers designed by the Quick
Change Primer Design-Agilent. 2 × 105 cells were transfected with
400 ng of ZFN expression vector and 4 μg of donor constructs.
Selection and cloningwere performed in RPMI mediumsupplemented
with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin starting 2–3 days post transfection. Clones
were obtained by limiting dilution and expanded before harvest for
western blot analysis.
HEK293T cells were purchased fromATCC. Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’smodified Eaglesmedium (DMEM), supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin (PS). The
platinum-E (PLAT-E) ecotropic virus-packaging cell line (a gift from
Toshio Kitamura) was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
puromycin, blasticidin, and PS. Cells were cultured in an incubator at
37 °C and 5% CO2 and routinely tested for mycoplasma using a
MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
ChIP
Chromatin preparation from K562 cells was performed as previously
described46. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, 150 μg of chromatin
(for FLAG ChIP) and 50 μg of chromatin (for histones ChIP)
was incubated with 3 μg anti-FLAG M2 (F1804, Sigma) or 1 μg anti-H3
(ab1791, Abcam), anti-H3K14ac (07–353, Upstate) and anti-H3K23ac
(07–355, Upstate) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of Protein G
Dynabeads for FLAG ChIP or 25 μl of Protein A Dynabeads were then
added to each sample, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for
4 h. The beads were washed extensively and eluted with 1% SDS and
0.1M NaHCO3. Cross-linked samples were reversed by heating
overnight at 65 °C in the presence of 0.2M NaCl. Samples were then
treated with RNase A and proteinase K for 2 h, and DNA was recovered
using MinElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, 28004) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR corrected
for primer efficiencies in the linear range was performed
using SYBR Green I (Roche, 04877352001) on a LightCycler 480
(Roche). Expression levels of MORFN1-716 WT, ΔWH1, ΔWH2 and
ΔWH1/2 were monitored by running SDS-PAGE and transferring onto
nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-FLAG M2 conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (A8592, Sigma) was used at 1:10,000 dilution.
Immunoblots were visualized using a Western Lightning plus ECL
reagent (Perkin-Elmer).
RT-qPCR
RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed
using a Superscript III First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit, with
oligo(dT) primers (Life Technologies).Gene expression was confirmed
by qPCR using TaqMan probes (Life Technologies). Expression levels,
normalized to those of Gapdh, were determined using a standard
curve and the relative quantification method as described in ABI User
Bulletin #2.
Fractionation-assisted native chromatin immunoprecipitation
(fanChIP)
Chromatin fractions from HEK293T cells were prepared using the
fanChIP method as previously described47. Cells were suspended in
CSK buffer and centrifuged to remove the soluble fraction in the same
manner as the nucfrIP analysis. The pellet was resuspended in MNase
buffer and treated with MNase at 37 °C for 3–6min to obtain oligonucloesomes.
The MNase reaction was stopped by adding EDTA (pH
8.0) to a final concentration of 20mM. Lysis buffer (250mM NaCl,
20mM sodium phosphate [pH 7.0], 30mM sodium pyrophosphate,
5mM EDTA, 10mM NaF, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, and
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail)was added to increase solubility.
The chromatin fraction was cleared by centrifugation and subjected to
immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies [FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich
F3165/M2, 1:400 dilution), MOZ (active motif 39868, 1:400 dilution),
MEAF6 (STJ 116836, 1:400 dilution), ING4 (Abcam 108621, 1:400 dilution),
HistoneH3K14ac (Abcamab52946, 1:400 dilution), RNAP2 non-P
(Abcam 8WG16/ab817, 1:400 dilution), RNAP2 Ser5-P (Millipore
CTD4H8/05-623, 1:400 dilution)] and magneticmicrobeads (Protein-G
magnet beads [Invitrogen]). Immunoprecipitates were washed five
times with washing buffer (1:1mixture of lysis buffer andMNase buffer
with 20mM EDTA) and then eluted in elution buffer. The eluted
material was analyzed by qPCR and deep sequencing.
ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq
The eluted material obtained by fanChIP was extracted by phenol/
chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. DNA was precipitated with glycogen
(Nacalai Tesque), dissolved in TE, and analyzed by qPCR and deep
sequencing. For deep sequencing, Purified DNA was further fragmented
(~150 bp long) using the Covaris M220 DNA shearing system
(M&M Instruments Inc.). Deep sequencing was performed using a
TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep Kit (illumina) and HiSeq2500 (illumina) at
the core facility of Hiroshima University and the University of Tokyo.
Data were visualized using the Integrative Genome Viewer (Broad
Institute). Raw reads in fastq format were trimmed using cutadapt and
aligned to the reference genome hg19 with BWA48,49. The alignment
tags were counted, and ppm was calculated every 25 bp from TSS and
TES of the genes. Heatmaps of ChIP signals on each TSS were generated
by ngsplot50. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of the precipitated
DNA was performed using the custom-made primer sets listed in
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. The values relative to inputs were
determined using a standard curve and the relative quantification
method.
CpG island recovery assay
CpG island recovery assays for unmethylated CpGs (CIRA) were performed
using the Unmethyl Collector kit (Active Motif) according to
themanufacturer’s instruction13. Briefly, genomic DNAs were prepared
from HEK293T cells using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) and
fragmented to the average size of 1 kb by sonication. The sonicated
DNAs (100 ng) were incubated with the Histidine-tagged recombinant
CXXC domain (6.5 μg) and magnetic nickel beads for 30min at room
temperature in the complete AM8 buffer supplied in the kit. The
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36368-5

reaction mixture was washed four times with the complete AM8 buffer
and then eluted with the AM3 elution buffer supplied in the kit. For
deep sequencing, purified DNA was further fragmented to the average
size of 150 bp by sonication using aCovarisM220DNA shearing system
(M&M Instruments Inc.) and sequenced as described above.
Virus production
Ecotropic retrovirus was produced using PLAT-E packaging cells51. The
supernatant medium containing the virus was harvested 24–48 h following
transfection and used for viral transduction.
Myeloid progenitor transformation assay
The myeloid progenitor transformation assay was carried out as previously
described52. Bone marrow cells were harvested from the
femurs and tibiae of 5-week-old female C57BL/6mice (purchased from
CLEA Japan, Inc). c-Kit-positive cells were enriched using magnetic
beads conjugated with an anti-c-Kit antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, 1:50
dilution), transduced with a recombinant retrovirus by spinoculation,
and then plated in a methylcellulose medium (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s
Medium, 20% FBS, 1.6% methylcellulose, and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol)
containing murine stem cell factors, interleukin-3, and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ngml−1 of
each). G418 (1mgml−1) was added to the first round of culture to select
for transduced cells. Hoxa9 expression was quantified by RT-qPCR
after the first round of culture. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were
quantified per 104 plated cells after 4–6 days in culture. This protocol
was approved by the National Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.
Microscopy protein–protein interaction
GST-tagged MORFWH2 (100 μM) was incubated with glutathione
Sepharose 4B beads (Thermo Fisher Sci) at 4 °C for 0.5–1 h then
washed with buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, and 5mM
BME). Buffer was removed and the beads were resuspended in 1:1
washing buffer. To prepare for imaging, 10 μM fluorescein (FAM)-
labeled 37 bp dsDNA (10–20 μM) was incubated with 10 μM of the
suspended beads for 0.5–1 hour at room temperature. Confocal images
were acquired on a Zeiss Observer.Z1 inverted microscope using a
488 nm laser for the excitation and emission of FAM. Images were
processed using ImageJ.
NMR experiments
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed at
298 K on Bruker 600MHz and Varian 900MHz spectrometers. The
1H,15N HSQC spectra of 0.1–0.2mM uniformly 15N-labeled WT or
mutant proteins were collected in the presence of increasing amount
of unlabeled proteins or DNA (IDT). NMR data were processed and
analyzed with NMRPipe and NMRDraw as previously described53.
Normalized chemical shift changes were calculated using the equation
Δδ =qffiðffiΔffiffiffiδffiffiffiHffiffiffiffiÞffi2ffiffiffi+ffiffiffiffiðffiffiΔffiffiffiδffiffiffiNffiffiffi=ffiffiffi5ffiffiÞffiffi2ffiffi, ð2Þ
where Δδ is the change in chemical shift in parts per million (ppm).
Structure determination for MORFWH2
NMR samples for structure determination contained 1.3mM 13C/
15N-labeledMORFWH2were prepared in 25mMTris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer,
supplemented with 150mM NaCl and 8% D2O. Backbone and side
chain chemical shift assignments for MORFWH2 were obtained by collecting
and processing a set of triple resonance experiments (HNCACB,
CBCA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, HNCA) with nonlinear sampling.
3D 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (mixing time of 100ms)
were collected to obtain distance restraints.
Calculation of the structure of MORFWH2 (aa 100–182) was
carried out using interproton NOE-derived distance restraints and
dihedral angle restraints. NMR spectra were processed and analyzed
with NMRDraw and CcpNmr Suite54. The program DANGLE in
CcpNmr Suite was used to predict dihedral angles ψ and φ
restraints. Hydrogen bonds were derived from characteristic NOE
patterns in combination with dihedral angles. The structures were
calculated and refined with XPLOR-NIH55. 100 structures were calculated,
and the ensemble of 15 conformers with the lowest total
energy was selected to represent MORFWH2. The quality of the
structures was validated using the program PROCHECK-NMR. The
percentage of residues in the most favored, additionally allowed,
generously allowed and disallowed regions is 86.1, 12.5, 1.4, and 0.0,
respectively. The structural statistics are listed in Supplementary
Table 1.
Nucleosome assembly
Human H2A, H2B, H3.2, and H4 histone proteins were expressed in
Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, separated frominclusion bodies
and purified using SEC and ion exchange chromatography. Histones
were then combined in 7Mguanidine HCl, 20mMTris-HCl pH 7.5, and
10mM dithiothreitol in appropriate molar ratios and refolded into
octamer by slow dialysis into 2M NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pH 8.0, and 2mM β-
mercaptoethanol. The octamer was purified from tetramer and
dimer by SEC. Octamer was then mixed with DNA (147 bp or 207 bp
601 Widom sequence) in 5–10mM Tris pH 8.0, 2M NaCl and
0.5–1.0mM EDTA, and NCPs were reconstituted by slow desalting
dialysis into 5–10mMTris pH 8.0 and 0.5–1.0mMEDTA. DNAs used in
fluorescence polarization were 147 bp 601 Widom DNA fluoresceinlabeled
on the 5’ end (for NCP147) and 207 bp DNA (147 bp 601 DNA
flankedwith 30 bp linkerDNA on either side and internally labeled with
fluorescein27bp infromthe 5’ end) (for NCP207). NCPswere separated
fromfreeDNA via sucrose gradient purification.When necessary,NCPs
were purified by SEC and peak fractions were pooled. All NCPs were
confirmed by SDS and native-PAGE. NCP187 was purchased from
Epicypher.
Fluorescence polarization
Fluorescence polarization measurements were carried out by mixing
increasing amounts of His-MORFWH1 (aa 5–84), WT and mutants,
MORFWH2 (aa 100–182), or His-MORFWH1-WH2 (aa 1–182) with 5 nM
NCP207 or NCP147 in 75mM NaCl, 25mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.00625%
Tween20, and 5mM dithiothreitol in a 30 μL reaction volume. The
samples were loaded into a Corning round-bottom polystyrene plate
and allowed to incubate at 4 °C for 30 min. The polarization measurements
were acquired with a Tecan infinite M1000Pro plate reader
by exciting at 470 nm and measuring polarized emission at 519 nm
with 5 nm excitation and emission bandwidths. The fluorescence
polarization was calculated from the emission polarized parallel and
perpendicular to the polarized excitation light as described
previously56. The data were then fit to a non-cooperative binding isotherm
to determine S1/2. The S1/2 values were averaged over three
separate experiments with error calculated as the standard deviation
between the runs.
Förster resonance energy transfer
The Cy3-Cy5 labeled NCP273 with Cy5 positioned at H2AK119C and Cy3
positioned at 54 bp from the DNA 5’ end were prepared using a protocol
described in ref. 40. To perform FRET efficiency measurements,
0.5 nM NCP273 were incubated with 0–300 nM His-MORFWH1-WH2 in
T130 buffer (10mM Tris, 130mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.0075%
TWEEN20) for 20min at room temperature. Fluorescence spectra
were collected on a FluoroMax 4 fluorometer (Horiba) by exciting Cy3
at 510 nm and Cy5 at 610 nm and measuring emission from 530 to
750 nm. RatioA method was used to calculate FRET efficiency40 from
six separate experiments.

Trypsin digestion of MORF
6 μl of 31μM MORFWH2-DPF-MYST (aa 100–703 with additional 3 lysine
residues at the C-terminus) co-expressed and purified with BRPF1 (aa
89–139) was treated with or without SIRT2 at 4 °C overnight in 30mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300mMNaCl, 5% glycerol, 5mMDTT, 0.5–1mMNAD,
5mMMgCl2, and 50μMZnCl2. Samples were denatured, reduced, and
alkylated in 5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10mM tris (2-carboxyethyl)
phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl), 40mM 2-chloroacetamide,
50mMTris pH 8.5 and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples
were prepared for mass spectrometry analyses using the SP3 method.
Carboxylate-functionalized speedbeads (GE Life Sciences) were added
to protein samples. Acetonitrile was added to 80% (v/v) to precipitate
protein and bind it to the beads. The protein-bound beads were
washed twice with 80% (v/v) ethanol and twice with 100% acetonitrile.
Lys-C/Trypsin mix (Promega) was added for 1:50 protease to protein
ratio in 50mM Tris pH 8.5 and incubated rotating at 37 °C overnight.
To clean up tryptic peptides, acetonitrile was added to 95% (v/v) to
precipitate and bind peptides to the beads. One wash with 100%
acetonitrile was performed and tryptic peptides were eluted twicewith
1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 3% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Eluate
were dried using a speed-vac rotatory evaporator.
Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/
MS) analysis
For acetylation sites analysis, the trypsinized peptides for the control (−)
SIRT (n = 1) and the acetylated (+) SIRT (n = 1) were resuspended in 0.1%
TFA, 3% acetonitrile in water, of which approximately 1 picomole of the
peptides for each sample was directly injected onto a Waters M-class
column (1.7 μm, 120 A, rpC18, 75 μm × 250mm) and gradient eluted
from 2% to 40% acetonitrile over 40 min at 0.3 μL/minute using a
Thermo Ultimate 3000 UPLC (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were
detected with a Thermo Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific) scanning MS1 spectra at 120,000 resolution from 380 to
1580 m/z with a 45ms fill time and 3E6 AGC target. The top 12 most
intense peaks were isolated with 1.4 m/z window with a 100 ms fill time
and 1E6 AGC target and 27% HCD collision energy for MS2 spectra
collected at 15,000 resolution. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for
5 seconds. MS data raw files were searched against the single Uniprot
sequence for MORF (Uniprot accession number Q8WYB5-3) using
Maxquant v.1.6.14.0 using Trypsin/P protease cleavage specificity
allowing for two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was
searched as a fixed modification, while methionine oxidation, protein
N-terminal and lysine side chain acetylation were treated as variable
modifications. The mass tolerances for the database search were 4.5
ppm for the precursors and 20 ppm for the MS2 fragment ions, the
minimumpeptide length was seven residues with no additional applied
score cutoffs. Peptide and protein level FDR were set at 0.01.
Cryo-EM sample preparation, data collection, and processing
197 bp Widom 601 nucleosome and PL2-6 nucleosome antibody fragment
(scFv) were prepared according to previous publication39. 197bp

AGCGACCACCCC. 10 μMMORFWH1-WH2 was added step-wise to 0.2 μM
197 bp nucleosome to a final 6:1 molar ratio (MORFWH1-
WH2:nucleosome) in 500 μl binding buffer (10mM HEPES, 0.1mM
EDTA, 10mM NaCl, 5mM 2-mercaptalethanol). After incubating the
mixture at room temperature for 30min, 100 μl of 3μM scFv was
added to the complex (threefold excess of scFv relative to the
nucleosome). The MORFWH1-WH2-nucleosome-scFv complex was then
dialyzed to binding buffer overnight and concentrated to 1 ~ 2 μMusing
a 30 kDa cut-off centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). 4 μl of prepared
complexwas applied to Lacey 300mesh carbon grids (Ted Pella), glow
discharged with a easiGlow discharger (Ted Pella) for 1min at 15 mA.
The grids were blotted using Whatman filter paper with 15 s waiting
time, 2–3 s blotting time, and 20 blotting force at 4 °C and 100%
humidity, then flash frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 2204 cryo-EM images were collected
on a Talos Arctica microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at
200 kV with a Gatan K3 Summit direct detection camera at the NCIFrederick
cryo-EM Facility. A magnification of 56 K was used, yielding
pixel size of 0.91 Å/pixel. The movie frames were recorded at a dose
rate of 18e-/px/s for 2.4 s exposure with 40 frames. SerialEM57 was used
for automatic data collection with defocus values set at a range from
−0.8 to −1.8 μm.
Cryo-EM data were processed using cryoSPARC v3 software
package58. Movie frames were aligned with Patch motion correction
and contrast-transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed by
Patch CTF estimation tools with cryoSPARC live during the data collection.
Particles picking were performed with Blob picker followed by
Template picker tools. Initial picked 219800 particles were cleaned by
one round of 2D classification, 66885 particles were selected for ab
initio model generation. Non-Uniform refinement were then performed
with the ab initio model and selected particles as input. A
generous mask was generated using the non-uniform refined map. 3D
variability analysis was performed using the generated mask and particles
from non-uniform refinement. A cluster reconstructed from
4629 particles were selected with the 3D variability analysis (4 cluster
mode) which shows extra density on the nucleosome dyad region. A
final non-uniform refinement was performed with particles from the
selected cluster, yielding an overall 7 Å cryo-EM map (See Supplementary
Fig. 8). Cryo-EM maps were illustrated using UCSF ChimeraX
(https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax).
Purification of native MORF complexes
For purification of native complexes, after large-scale expansion of
K562 clones, affinity purifications of tagged MORFN WT (aa 2–716),
ΔWH1 (aa 86–716), ΔWH2 (aa 2–99 + aa 183–716) and ΔWH1/2 (aa
183–716), were performed on nuclear extracts as previously
described59. Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared following standard
procedures and pre-cleared with CL6B Sepharose beads. FLAG
immunoprecipitations with anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel (Sigma M2,
250 μl) were performed, followed by elution with 3xFLAG peptide
(200 μg/mL fromSigma) in the following buffer: 20mMHEPES pH 7.5,
150mMKCl, 0.1mMEDTA, 10%glycerol, 0.1%Tween20, 1mMDTTand
supplemented with proteases, deacetylases, and phosphatase inhibitors.
Expression was measured by WB (Supplementary Fig. 3a) using
anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F1804, 1:10,000 dilution) and anti-WDR5 (a gift
from Edwin Smith, 1:1000 dilution) antibodies.
In vitro HAT assays of the MORFN complexes
Acetyltransferase activity of the purified complexes containing
MORFN WT (aa 2–716), ΔWH1 (aa 86–716), ΔWH2 (aa 2–99 + aa
183–716) or ΔWH1/2 (aa 183–716) was measured using 0.125 μCi of 3H
labeled Ac-CoA (2.1 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 150 μM of
unlabeled (cold) Ac-CoA. The HAT reactions were performed in a
volume of 15 μl using 0.5 μg of NCP207 (30 bp linker DNA flanking both
sides of 147 bp 601WidomDNA) (produced as previously described60)
and NCP147, in HAT buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50mM KCl, 10mM
sodium butyrate, 5% glycerol, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM dithiothreitol) for
30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were then captured on P81 filter paper,
the free 3H-labeled Ac-CoA was washed away, and the paper was analyzed
by liquid scintillation. For in vitro HAT assays with cold Ac-CoA,
the HAT activity of WT and mutated MORFN complexes on specific
sites of histone H3 were monitored by western blot. Wild type and
mutant complexes were normalized by western blot and the HAT

activity on free histones. The following antibodies were used: anti-
H3K23ac (Upstate, 07–355, 1:1000 dilution) and anti-H3 (Abcam,
ab1791, 1:20,000 dilution).
Statistics and reproducibility
Statistical analysis shown in Fig. 6 was performed using GraphPad
Prism 8 and Microsoft Excel software. Data are presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). EMSA experiments were performed at least
twice. Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way or twoway
ANOVA; all statistical tests were two-sided. Statistical significance
was set at P ≤ 0.05. n.s.: P>0.05, *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, and
****P ≤ 0.0001 (Fig. 1f–h), and ***P<0.005, 0.005 < **P<0.01 and
0.01 < *P<0.05 by student’s t‐test (Fig. 9a).
