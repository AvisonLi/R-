Abstract
The aging population is a common problem faced by most countries in the world. This study
uses 18 years (from 2002 to 2019) of panel data from 31 regions in China (excluding Hong
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Province), and establishes a panel threshold regression model to
study the non-linear impact of the aging population on economic development. It is different
from traditional research in that this paper divides 31 regions in China into three regions:
Eastern, Central, and Western according to the classification standard of the National
Bureau of Statistics of China and compares the different impacts of the aging population on
economic development in the three regions. Although this study finds that the aging population
promotes the economy of China’s eastern, central, and western regions, different
threshold variables have dramatically different influences. When the sum of export and
import is the threshold variable, the impact of the aging population on the eastern and the
central region of China is significantly larger than that of the western region of China. However,
when the unemployment rate is the threshold variable, the impact of the aging population
on the western region of China is dramatically higher than the other regions’ impact.
Thus, one of the contributions of this study is that if the local government wants to increase
the positive impact of the aging population on the per capita GDP of China, the local governments
of different regions should advocate more policies that align with their economic situation
rather than always emulating policies from other regions.
Background
The aging population is a new hot issue raised in recent decades. According to the World
Health Organization’s definition, the aging population refers to the number of elderly people
over 65 years old accounting for more than 7% of the total population in a country or region.
The aging population is a sociological issue, but Solow and Modigliani and Ando built a bridge
between the aging population and economic development through their research and theories.

From the perspective of the labor force, Solow [1] pointed out that the population growth rate
was one of the important factors affecting economic development. However, he assumed that
the whole population of a country or region was an effective labor force, which was not in line
with reality. Therefore, based on Solow’s research, Modigliani and Ando [2] put forward the
life cycle hypothesis. This hypothesis roughly divides a person’s life into two periods: the working
period (15–64 years old) and the retirement period (over 65 years old). Modigliani and
Ando assumed that people lost their ability to work and had no income during the retirement
period. Thus, all consumption of old people during the retirement period came from their savings
from the work period. Therefore, as the population ages, a country’s total savings will continue
to decline and ultimately hinder economic growth.
Based on the above studies and theories, many scholars use linear models to study the
impact of the aging population on economic growth, but this research method has major
flaws. For example, Yang et al. [3] found that the aging population would inhibit economic
growth by reducing the ecological footprint; Lukyanets et al. [4] also found that the aging population
would reduce economic growth in Russia; Scott et al. [5] and Liu [6] got the same conclusion.
However, Pham and Vo [7], Mamun et al. [8], and Wang et al. [9] found that the
aging population would promote economic growth. The reason why this study believes that
the conclusions of these studies are contradictory is that: in the early stage of the aging population,
although the elderly population is increasing, the young population (15–64 years old) is
also increasing. At this stage, because the increase in the number of the elderly population is
less than the increase in the number of the young population, the negative impact of the elderly
population on economic growth will be offset by the positive impact of the young population
on economic growth. Therefore, in the early stage of the aging population, the aging population
will promote economic growth. However, in the late stage of the aging population,
because the increase in the number of the elderly population is greater than that of the young
population, the aging population will inhibit economic growth. Therefore, if the linear model
is used to study the impact of the aging population on economic growth, the linear model only
can reflect partial information of data. Yang et al., using the across-country data, proved there
were nonlinear effects between the aging population and economic growth [10]. Therefore,
this study will use the nonlinear model to study the impact of the aging population on economic
growth.
In addition, most scholars currently study the impact of the aging population on economic
growth in the context of developed countries, but this is inconsistent with the future trend of
the global aging population. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, there
will be 2.1 billion people over the age of 60 by 2050, and most older people will live in developing
countries. Therefore, this study takes China as an example to study the impact of the aging
population on the economic growth of developing countries.
China is a socialist country, and local governments must follow the policies of the central
government. Thus, from the policy perspective, the impact of the aging population on all
regions of China should be the same. However, it is not. There are significant differences in
the relationship between the aging population and economic development in different regions
of China (see S1 Appendix). For example, the aging population in Shanghai was negatively correlated
with economic development from 2002 to 2011 but positively correlated with economic
development thereafter. While the relationship between the aging population and economic
development is firstly positively correlated and then negatively correlated in Heilongjiang
province during the same period. This finding is the exact opposite of what happened in
Shanghai. Besides, the aging population in Tibet Autonomous Region does not seem to be
directly related to economic development. Apart from that, the aging population in Guangxi is
almost positively related to economic development.

Funding: The author(s) received no specific
funding for this work.
Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
Besides, in studies comparing the impact of the aging population on economic growth in
different regions, most scholars, like Yang et al., compare the differences between countries
[10]. However, different countries have different cultures, social systems, policies, and other
factors. Therefore, it is difficult for different countries to learn from each other’s experiences.
Thus, based on the current data in China and the research perspective of scholars, this study
proposes a new research question: Why does the aging population have different impacts on
economic development in different regions of China? Because China has 31 regions (excluding
Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan), comparing the differences between regions is unrealistic.
Therefore, this study follows the geographical classification of Xie et al. [11] and divides China’s
31 regions into three regions: eastern, central, and western. The study aims to examine the
different impacts of the aging population on economic development in the three regions of
China.
The contributions of this paper are as follows: first, this study provides experiences to developing
countries on the impact of the aging population on economic growth; second, this study
fills in the gaps in the impact of the aging population on regional differences in the same country.
Third, this study provides policy suggestions for China’s regions that are relatively backward
in economic development. Fourth, this study uses a more advanced panel threshold
regression (PTR), which can provide more comprehensive and accurate conclusions.
This study aims to examine the different impacts of the aging population on different
regions in China. Besides, the rest of this study is structured as follows: Section 2 examines the
relevant and recent studies and proposes hypotheses based on them; Section 3 explains the
methodology and data processing and sources; Section 4 presents the empirical research and
discussions, and the final section illustrates the empirical results and policy recommendations
to the Chinese government.
Literature review
Most scholars take developed countries as their research objects when they study the impact of
population aging on economic growth. For example, Maestas et al. [12] found that the aging
population inhibits U.S. economic growth. The main reason is a decline in labor productivity.
The second reason is a decline in the number of workers. This study concluded that for every
10% increase in the population over 60 years old, U.S. GDP fell by 5.5%. However, it is not
realistic to define people over 60 years old as elderly. Because of the development of the medical
level, the average life expectancy has greatly increased. Therefore, the Chinese government
formulated a delayed retirement plan in 2015 and officially implemented it in 2022. Gordon
[13] compared the panel data of the United States and other developed countries and came to
the same conclusion. Besides, they found that the unemployment and gap between the rich
and the poor would also impede economic development. Nevertheless, the comparison
between countries cannot provide their own experience because different countries have different
political systems, cultural backgrounds, development stages, etc. are not the same.
In the study of developed countries or regions in East Asia, Goh and McNown [14] and
Huang et al. [15] both used time series methods. The former finds that the aging population
inhibits Japan’s economic growth due to the decline in total savings, which is consistent with
the conclusion of Modigliani and Ando [2]. The latter finds that the impact of the aging population
on the economic growth of the Taiwan province of China is more complex. Specifically,
the aging population would restrain economic growth. However, the aging population would
increase total factor productivity (TFP) at the same time. Although the two studies explain
why the aging population inhibits economic growth from different perspectives, the time series
data reflect limited information. Both Lee et al. [16] and Kim and Lee [17] found that the
PLOS ONE Regional impact of aging population on economic development in China
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282913 March 14, 2023 3 / 21
aging population would depress South Korea’s economic growth. However, the variables used
by Lee et al. [16] cannot accurately measure the aging population. In their study, the variables
measuring the aging population are the proportion of the young population and the proportion
of the old population. At present, a more accurate variable is the old dependency ratio.
Kim and Lee [17] assumed that the age distribution was constant in their research. Nevertheless,
the aging population is caused by the uneven age distribution caused by the continuous
decline in the birth rate. In addition, they did not consider the role of capital deepening.
In addition, some scholars have studied the impact of the aging population on the economic
growth of European countries. For example, Kamiguchi and Tamia [18] use an intergenerational
iterative model to find that the aging population inhibits economic growth by increasing
public debt. Jackson [19] came to the same conclusion and found that the decline in innovation
ability is also one of the reasons why the aging population inhibits economic growth. In
addition, Lorenz et al. [20] also found that the healthcare expenditure caused by the aging population
is the main reason for reducing economic growth. These three studies inspired this
study to consider the impact of changes in social welfare on economic growth. Because unlike
developed countries, China’s per capita GDP when the population age is far lower than developed
countries’ per capita GDP when the population age. Therefore, the Chinese government
cannot ignore the public debt caused by the aging population. In addition, Cooley et al. [21],
Pascual-Saez et al. [22],S ˇ ı´dlo et al. [23], and Bobeica et al. [24] have confirmed that the aging
population would cause total savings to decrease, inflation and other things that would hold
back the economy. Through the above literature, it can be found that the impact of the aging
population on developed countries or regions is negative.
A few scholars surprisingly found that the aging population would promote economic
growth in developing countries. For example, Mamun et al. [8] found that the aging population
boosts economic growth in Bangladesh. Their study supports Prettner ’s conclusions, and
they believe that the reason for this phenomenon is that the Bangladeshi government does not
provide enough subsidies to the elderly [25]. However, their research lacks human capital data.
Ifa and Guetat studied data from Tunisia and Morocco and found that the aging population
would force the government to invest more capital in health and ultimately promote economic
growth [26]. Research by Wang et al. [27] shows that life expectancy and economic development
were positively correlated. This conclusion proves the research of Ifa and Guetat [26].
However, the study did not consider the increased retirement age due to increases in life
expectancy. Thus, we do not know how an increase in life expectancy stimulates economic
growth.
However, the aging population does not affect developing countries uniformly. For example,
Peña [28] found that the increase in public debt caused by the aging population was the
main reason for El Salvador’s economic growth rate slowdown. This finding is consistent with
research conclusions in developed countries. In addition, Miri et al. [29] found through data
from Iran that the relationship between the aging population and economic growth was nonlinear.
But they did not use the old dependency ratio but the proportion of the elderly population
and the proportion of the youth population.
The above studies show that the impact of the aging population on the economic growth of
developed countries is quite different from the impact of the aging population on that of developing
countries. The possible reasons for this difference are explained in the Introduction section
of this study. Therefore, this study proposes the following assumptions:
H1: The aging population has a significant impact on economic growth in developing
countries
PLOS ONE Regional impact of aging population on economic development in China
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282913 March 14, 2023 4 / 21
H1o: The relationship between the aging population and economic development in developing
countries is linear
H1a: The relationship between the aging population and economic development in developing
countries is nonlinear.
Some scholars use cross-country data to study the impact of the aging population on economic
growth. For example, Vollset et al., based on data from 195 countries, found that the
aging population and increased public debt lower GDP per capita [30]. However, some immigration
data are missing in the research. Immigration means that a country’s labor force
sharply increases, which will significantly alleviate the negative impact of the aging population
on economic growth. Therefore, the absence of some immigration data will affect the accuracy
of the conclusion. De Albuquerque et al. [31] proved an inverted U-shaped relationship
between the aging population and economic growth from an inflation perspective. Specifically,
an increase in the number of older people is inflationary, and an increase in young people is
deflationary. However, the study does not fit China’s national conditions. In traditional Chinese
culture, the elderly will not consume all their savings before dying. In other words, they
are more inclined to endow their children. Eggertsson et al. [32] examine the impact of the
aging population on economic growth in OECD member countries. Studies have shown that
during 1990–2008, the aging population promoted economic growth; during 2008–2015, the
aging population inhibited economic growth. However, the economic level of developed countries
facing an aging population is entirely different from that of developing countries’. In
addition, Lee and Shin [33] and Yang et al. [10] also found an inverted U-shaped relationship
between the aging population and economic growth. The above studies using cross-country
data all have an obvious limitation: they do not compare and research different countries or
regions.
In examining the impact of the aging population on China’s economic growth, Chen et al.
[34] found that the decline in the labor force participation rate caused by population aging was
the main reason for the slowdown in economic growth. However, they used time series data
and did not compare the differences between different provinces or regions within China. Liu
’s research shows that the aging population would inhibit China’s economic development [6].
In this study, the author compared the changes in China’s economic development before and
after the implementation of the two-child policy. Research by Bai and Lei [35] shows that the
aging population has hurt China’s economic growth since 2000. On the one hand, the aging
population reduced labor productivity and labor participation rates. On the other hand, the
aging population declined the total saving of society. Wang and Yu [9] proved that the aging
population would inhibit economic growth from the perspective of consumption. Cao et al.
[36] proposed that China should reduce the negative impact of the aging population on economic
growth by increasing education, expanding the urbanization rate, and postponing
retirement. However, in many studies on the impact of the aging population on China’s economic
growth, scholars only analyze the effects of the aging population on economic growth
from a macro perspective without comparing and researching the effects of the aging population
on different regions of China. Therefore, this study puts forward the following hypotheses
based on the above research:
H2o: The aging population will have differential impacts on economic growth in different
regions of China.
H2a: The aging population will not have differential impacts on economic growth in different
regions of China.

Methodology
Data sources and processing
This study’s original data are from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. To make the data
more stable and avoid heteroscedasticity, this study takes the logarithm of all the data. Apart
from that, this study uses panel data which includes 31 regions of China (Hong Kong, Macao,
and Taiwan Province excluded), and the time frame is 18 years (2002 to 2019). The definition
and calculation of variables can be seen in Table 1 below. Specifically, explained variable is per
capita GDP. The explanatory variable is the old-dependency ratio. The threshold variables are
the unemployment rate and the sum of exports and imports. Lastly, the control variables are the
child-dependent ratio, the percentage of working people, and the illiteracy rate.
Because China has 31 regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan), it is unrealistic
to pairwise compare the differences between regions. Thus, scholars usually divided China
into several regions to compare and research. However, different scholars adopt different classification
methods. For example, Zou et al. [37] and Wang et al. [27] directly divide China into
rural and urban. However, in the past 20 years, China’s urbanization rate has increased rapidly.
Therefore, this method is no longer suitable. In addition, Liu et al. [38] only studied Northwest
China. It cannot comprehensively reflect the impact of the aging population of China. Thus,
this study divides 31 regions of China into three regions: the eastern, central, and western
regions. The eastern region has eleven regions, the central region has eight regions, and the
western region has twelve regions. The classification of this study is based on the research of
Xie et al. [11] and the National Bureau of Statistics of China which is in Table 2 below.
Model specification
This study will establish a panel threshold regression model. PTR model views a threshold variable
as an unknown variable, establishes a piecewise function, and examines and estimates the
corresponding threshold values and the effects. Lee and Shin [33] confirmed the non-linear
relationship between the aging population and economic development. Hence, this study constructs
the threshold model based on the research of Hansen [39] to study the relationship
between the aging population and economic development at different intervals. In this study, a
single threshold regression model will be constructed first and then extended to a multiplethreshold
regression model. The construction of the single threshold regression model is as follows:
Yit ¼ di þ b0Xit þ y1gitIðdit   gÞ þ y2gitIðdit > gÞ þ oit ð1Þ

where i represents the three regions of China; t represents the time; Yit represents the dependent
variable which is per capita GDP; git represents the independent variable which is the old

the children dependency ratio and the illiteracy rate;

After eliminating the individual effects in each group from each observation by subtracting

After stacking the observations, Eq (2) can be written as follow:

After the parameter is obtained, there are two steps to estimate the threshold proposed by
Huang et al. [40]. The first step is to test whether the model has a threshold effect. Hence, the
null hypothesis is that there is a linear relationship between variables and the alternative

hypothesis is that a threshold effect exists. The function is as follows:

In the null hypothesis, the specific value of γ cannot be calculated. Apart from that, the distribution
of the F1 statistic is non-standard either. According to the suggestion of Hansen
(2000), people can estimate progressive distribution and P-values through bootstrap.
The second step is to test whether the estimated threshold value equals the actual value.
Therefore, the null hypothesis of the test is that the outcomes are the same, and the alternative
hypothesis of the test is that the outcomes are not the same. The function of likelihood ratio

still cannot reject the null hypothesis while α is significant.
Apart from the single threshold model, there is also a multi-threshold model in empirical
analysis. Therefore, this study takes the double threshold as an example to illustrate the threshold
regression. The function is as follows:
Yit ¼ di þ b0Xit þ y1gitI dit   g1 ð Þ þ y2gitI g1 < dit   g2 ð Þ þ y3gitI dit > g2 ð Þ þ oit ð9Þ
In double threshold regression, we assume that we already have estimated the specific value
of the ^ g1 . Hence, we only need to estimate ^ g2 The function is as follows:

where
^ga

to acquire a consistent value.
Unit root test
All econometric methods including time series must first pass the unit root test between variables
because the variables cannot pass the unit root test This means that there may be spurious
regressions between the variables, and the result will be meaningless.
In more literature reviews, for example, Pesaran [41] pointed out that the cross-sectional
dependence problem exists in panel data. The reason for this problem is the unobserved components
and common shocks. Therefore, cross-sectional dependence issues reduce the accuracy
of the results and can even lead to false results.
The panel data is composed of cross-sectional and time-series data. Therefore, the stationarity
of the data needs to be considered in the diagnostic test. However, the first generation of
unit root tests did not consider the cross-sectional dependency problem. Specifically, if the
panel data has a cross-sectional dependency problem, the first-generation unit root test will
erroneously reject the null hypothesis.
PLOS ONE Regional impact of aging population on economic development in China
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282913 March 14, 2023 8 / 21
Although the second-generation unit root test considers the cross-sectional dependency
problem, Urbain and Westerlund [42] believe that the homogeneity assumption in the crosssection
dependency problem is still not true. Therefore, this study uses the unit root test of
Pesaran [41]. The formula can be written as follow:
ait ¼ di þ bitbit þ mit ð12Þ
In the Eq (12), ait is the dependent variable, bit is the independent variable, βit is the coefficient
of the independent variable and δi is an individual nuisance parameter that will not
change with time. For the subscript, i is unit and t is time.
Cointegration test
Most macroeconomic variables are trended, but the trended time series may cause serious
problems in empirical models due to spurious regressions. In general, one of the methods to
solve the spurious regression is by differencing the series to achieve stationarity. Then we use
the stationarity series and analyze the outcome. However, this method will produce other
problems. For example, differencing all variables means that the error term is also differenced.
This will produce a non-invertible moving average error process, which will lead to serious
estimation problems. In addition, if we difference the variables, the model will not give us a
unique long-run solution.
Engle and Granger [43] firstly pointed out that if there is a co-integration relationship
between variables, the model will not have spurious regression problems. Next, more panel cointegration
test methods are employed in the empirical model. For example, both Pedroni [44]
and Persyn and Westerlund [45] proposed a panel co-integration test, but this study adopted
the method of Persyn and Westerlund [45]. This method not only considers the structural
breaks but also the lead-lag lengths when we employed short-duration data. The specific bootstrap
panel co-integration formula is as follows:
DYit ¼ d0dt þ ai Yi;t􀀀 1 􀀀 b
0
iXi;t􀀀 1
   
þ
Xqi
j¼qi
aijDYi;t􀀀 j þ
Xqi
j¼qi
gijDXi;t􀀀 j þ eit ð13Þ
In the above equation, ΔYit is an endogenous variable, and dt refers to the deterministic
component. i is unit and t is time.
Empirical result
To research the impact of the aging population on economic development, this study views the
unemployment rate and the sum of imports and exports on economic development as the
threshold variable. It uses 18 years of data (2002 to 2019) from 31 regions of China. During
this process, the study divides the 31 regions of China into three groups: the eastern, central,
and western regions to compare the different threshold effects of the aging population on economic
development in the three regions.
Descriptive statistics summary
Firstly, to make the data more stable and avoid heteroscedasticity, this study takes the logarithm
of all the data. The lpcgdp is log the per capita GDP; the lodr is log the old-dependency
ratio; the lil is log the illiteracy; the lei is log the sum of export and import; lue is log the unemployment
rate; lcdr is log the child-dependency ratio; and lwp is log the number of working
people.

Tables 3–8 list the descriptive statistics and pairwise correlation tests between variables of
the eastern, central, and western regions of China. The mean value of lpcgdp in the three
regions of China is almost the same. However, the standard deviations of lpcgdp of the eastern
and central regions of China are dramatically higher than that of the western region of China.
It means that the income gap between poor and rich people in the eastern and central regions
of China is significantly higher than that in the western region of China. In terms of the sum of
export and import, different cities in the eastern and western regions of China have huge gaps.
However, the gap between the cities in the central region of China is relatively small. Besides,
people in the eastern and central regions of China received a better education than people in
the western region of China.
Secondly, this study processes unit root test to make sure that all data are stable. The outcomes
from Tables 9–11 show that all data are significant in the first difference.
Thirdly, this study processes the cointegration test to make sure that there is no spurious
regression. In the co-integration test, this study utilizes the first difference of variables, and the
null hypothesis of the co-integration test is that there is no co-integration. The outcomes from
Table 12 show no spurious regression in China’s eastern, central, and western regions.
Thirdly, this study tests whether there is a threshold effect between variables. In this test,
this study utilizes Stata 15.1 version and sets bootstrap to 300, grid to 400, and trim to 0.01. In
Table 13, model 1, model 2, and model 3 respectively represent the result of the eastern, central,
and western regions of China when the LEI is the threshold variable. The outcomes show
that in the eastern region and the western region of China, there is only one threshold value,
respectively. However, in the central region of China, there are two threshold values.
In Table 14, model 4, model 5, and model 6 respectively represent the result of the eastern,
central, and western regions of China when the LUE is the threshold variable. The outcomes
show that in the eastern and central regions of China, there is only one threshold value, separately.
However, there are two threshold values in the western region of China.
Results and discussion
Sum of exports and imports
After the data pass all pre-requisite tests, this study process threshold regression and outcomes
are presented in Table 15. Model 1, model 2, and model 3 represent the results of the eastern,
central, and western regions of China when the LEI is the threshold variable. The outcomes
show that the threshold value of LEI in the eastern region of China is 18.80. Therefore, due to
all variables taking the logarithm, the actual value of the sum of exports and imports is 14.613
billion dollars. Similarly, the data of the western region of China have been divided into two
groups by the level of LEI and the threshold value of LEI is 13.1 (0.049 billion dollars).

However, the data of the central region of China are divided into three groups and the threshold
values of LEI separately are 16.321 (1.225 billion dollars) and 17.075 (2.604 billion dollars).
Firstly, Table 16 presents that the aging population has a significant positive relationship
with per capita GDP in the three regions of China when the LEI is the threshold variable.
Besides, for the eastern China and western regions of China, there is only one turning point
for the impact of the aging population on economic growth. However, there are two turning
points in central China.
For Eastern China, the turning point of the impact of the aging population on economic
growth is when the LEI equals 18.80. In other words, when the LEI is less than or equal to
18.80, the coefficient of LDOR is 2.738; when the LEI is greater than 18.80, the coefficient of
LODR is 2.872. Therefore, when the sum of imports and exports of eastern China is increased
to more than 146.129 million yuan, the impact of the aging population on economic growth is
optimal.
In terms of central China, when the LEI is less than or equal to 16.321, the coefficient of
LODR is 3.050. When LEI exceeds the first turning point but does not exceed the second turning
point, that is, when 16.321 is less than LEI and LEI is less than or equal to 17.075, the coefficient
of LODR becomes 3.181. When the LEI crosses the second turning point, the coefficient
of LODR is 3.290. Therefore, for central China, the government should increase the sum of
imports and exports to more than 26.0365 million yuan because the impact of the aging population
on economic growth is optimal at this LEI level.
For western China, LEI equal to 13.10 is a turning point for the impact of the aging population
on economic growth. When the LEI is less than or equal to 13.10, the coefficient of LODR
is 1.426; when the LEI is greater than 13.10, the coefficient of LODR is 1.667. Thus, from the
perspective of promoting economic development, this study proposes that the government
should increase the sum of imports and exports in western China to more than 489,000 yuan.
Regardless of whether it is eastern China, central China or western China, the aging population
always promotes economic growth, and the marginal effect will gradually increase. But

the absolute values of the optimal points in the three regions have very large differences.
Therefore, this study argues that more attention should be paid to the sum of imports and
exports in the eastern region for the Chinese government. Thus, this study believes that China
is currently in the early stage of the aging population.
Secondly, the impact of the unemployment rate on the per capita GDP is not the same. In
China’s western region, there is a significant negative linear relationship between the unemployment
rate and the per capita GDP. This outcome is consistent with the research of Karikari-
Apau and Abeti [46] and Egbejule and Oshiokpekhai [47]. Besides, Gordon [13] also
found that the unemployment rate would decrease the birth rate. But in the eastern and central
regions of China, there is no linear relationship between the unemployment rate and the per
capita GDP. Thus, the government can increase the per capita GDP by decreasing the unemployment
rate in the western region of China.
Thirdly, the child dependency ratio has different influences on the per capita GDP in the
three regions of China. The relationship between the child dependency ratio and the per capita
GDP is significantly positive in both the eastern and central regions of China. İmrohoroğlu
and Zhao [48] found that the one-child policy increased the savings rate by reducing family
insurance, which might be the reason why the child dependency ratio promoted economic
growth. However, in terms of China’s western region, the outcome points out that there is no
linear relationship between the child dependency ratio and economic development. Apart
from that, the degree of influence from the child dependency ratio in the eastern and central
regions of China is almost the same, which are 2.418% and 2.758%, respectively. Research of
Cruz and Ahmed [49] shows that an increase in the child dependency ratio decreased per capita
GDP. They believed that if a family had few children, the family would have more per capita
resources to consume or invest. Thus, a rise in the saving rate caused by an increase in the
number of children is offset by a fall in consumption and investment. This may be the reason
why there is no linear relationship between the child dependency ratio and economic growth
in western China.

Fourthly, the influence of the percentage of working people is the same as the influence of
the child dependency ratio. The degree of influence from the percentage of working people,
however, is bigger. For example, in the eastern region of China, the coefficient of the percentage
of working people is 17.487. It means that every 1% change in the percentage of working
people will change 17.487% in the per capita GDP. Similarly, in terms of the central region of
China, the degree of influence is 17.201%. Oliinyk’s research points out that high-skilled immigration
could significantly promote economic growth [50]. At the same time, immigration can
increase the proportion of the working population in a short period. Therefore, increasing the
percentage of working people is more effective than decreasing the illiteracy rate, decreasing
the unemployment rate, increasing the child dependency ratio, and increasing the sum of
export and import.
Unemployment rate
In Table 17, model 4, model 5, and model 6 respectively represent the result of the eastern
region, the central region, and the western region of China when the LUE is the threshold variable.
The outcomes illustrate that the threshold value of LUE in the eastern region of China is
1.090. Due to all variables taking the logarithm, the actual value of the unemployment rate is
3.001%. Similarly, the data of the central region of China have been divided into two groups as
well by the level of LUE and the threshold value of LUE is 1.361 (3.900%). However, the data
of the western region of China have been divided into three groups and the threshold values of
LUE separately are 1.131 (3.099%) and 1.308 (3.699%).

Firstly, Table 18 shows that the impact of the aging population on the per capita GDP is significantly
positive in the three regions of China when the LUE is the threshold variable. However,
unlike the sum of imports and exports, there is only one turning point in eastern and
central China, but there are two turning points in western China.
For eastern China, when the LUE is less than or equal to 1.099, the coefficient of LODR is
1.582; when the LUE is greater than 1.099, the coefficient of LODR is 1.492, and both are statistically
significant at the 1% level. Therefore, reducing the unemployment rate below 3.001% is
more conducive to promoting the positive impact of the aging population on economic
growth.
In terms of central China, the turning point of the impact of the aging population on economic
growth is when the LUE is equal to 1.361. When the LUE is on the left side of the turning
point, the coefficient of LODR is 1.267; when the LUE is on the right side of the turning
point, the coefficient of LODR is 1.215, and both are significant at the 1% level. Thus, reducing
the unemployment rate below 3.900% is more conducive to promoting the positive impact of
population aging on economic growth.
For western China, there are two turning points for the impact of the aging population on
economic growth: 1.131 and 1.308. When the LUE is less than or equal to 1.131, the coefficient
of LODR is 1.907; when the LUE is between the two turning points, the coefficient of LODR is

1.787; when the LUE is greater than 1.308, the coefficient of LODR is 1.684. Therefore, from
the perspective of promoting economic growth, the government should control the unemployment
rate below 3.099%.
Reducing the unemployment rate will promote the positive effect of the aging population
on economic growth in all three regions of China. However, the impact on the central region
of China is relatively small, and the impact on the western region of China is relatively large.
This study believes that the reason for this phenomenon is that the population in central
China is relatively large, so the impact of changes in the unemployment rate is relatively small.
However, the population in western China is smaller, so once the unemployment rate changes,
the working population changes significantly, which ultimately affects economic growth.
Secondly, the degree of influence of LIL is almost the same in the central region and the
western region of China. However, the LIL has much more influence in the eastern region of
China. In other words, in the same situation, increasing the education opportunity will be
more effective in the eastern region of China than in the other two regions. This conclusion is
the same as the research of Chen et al. [34].
Thirdly, the degree of influence of LEI is not the same in the three regions of China. For the
eastern and central regions of China, increasing the sum of export and import can significantly
increase per capita GDP. On the other hand, for the western region of China, the sum of export
and import only has limited benefits.
Fourthly, the LCDR only has a positive linear relationship with the per capita GDP in the
eastern region of China. In the rest of the two regions, the outcome points out that there is no
linear relationship. Similarly, LWP is almost the same as the LCDR, but the only difference is
that LWP has much more influence than the LCDR.
Conclusion remarks and implication
Conclusions
Firstly, both the perspectives of the LEI and the LUE prove that the impact of the aging population
on the per capita GDP in China is significantly positive. In other words, this study suggests
that China is in the early stage of the aging population. Due to the number of working
people and the number of older people increasing together, and the increasing speed of working
people being faster than that of older people, the relationship between the aging population
and the per capita GDP is positive. Although this conclusion is not the same as the previous

research, it still agrees with some authors’ opinions. For example, Lee and Shin [33] found that
the relationship between the aging population and economic development is non-linear.
Besides, Mamun et al. [8] report that in Bangladesh, the aging population has a significant,
long-run, positive relationship with the per capita GDP growth. Apart from that, Li and Zhang
[51] found that in China, the aging population will have upward pressure on productivity
which ultimately promotes economic development in China.
Secondly, this study innovative proves that under the aging population background, nowadays,
there is a diminishing marginal effect between the sum of export and import and economic
development in the central region of China as well as between the unemployment rate and economic
development in the western region of China. For instance, in the central region of China,
when the investment of the sum of export and import is over the first threshold value (1.225 billion
dollars), the coefficient of LODR changes from 3.050 to 3.181: the gap is 0.131. However,
when the investment of the sum of export and import is over the second threshold value (2.604
billion dollars), the coefficient of LODR changes from 3.050 to 3.181: the gap is 0.103. The benefits
from the investment of the sum of export and import are decreasing. Similarly, the benefits
from the unemployment rate are decreasing as well and the change is from 0.120 to 0.103.
Thirdly, from the perspectives of the LEI and the LUE, increasing education opportunities
can promote significant economic development in all regions of China. Yet, education is more
important in the eastern region of China than in the other two regions. The reason is that eight
of the top ten regions with the highest per capita GDP are in the eastern region of China. In
other words, most enterprises build their headquarters in the eastern region of China. Thus,
the eastern region of China needs more educated workers than the other two regions. It
explains why the coefficient of LIL in the eastern region of China is far lower than in the other
two regions.
Fourthly, the most effective method to improve economic development under the aging population
background in the three regions of China is increasing the percentage of working people.
According to Tables 16 and 18, this study finds that the coefficients of LWP are around
eight times that of other coefficients. It means that in the same situations, every 1% change in
the LWP will have about eight times more benefits than every 1% change in the other variables.
Fifthly, the local governments of different regions should disseminate policies that align
with their economic situation rather than always imitating policies from other regions. For

instance, the local government of China’s central region can expand the sum of export and
import to increase the positive impact of the aging population on economic development.
However, if the government of China’s western region utilizes the same policies, the benefits
will relatively be limited. Similarly, introducing policies that can increase the employment rate
is more important for China’s western region. The above conclusions prove that the aging
population has differential impacts on economic growth in different regions of China.
Policy implication
The research findings indicate that in China, the present aging population has a positive relationship
with economic development in all regions. However, with the increasing number of
them, eventually, they will have a negative influence on economic development. Therefore, the
Chinese government should take precautions and issue forward-looking policies to minimize
the negative impacts the aging population might create on future economic development.
Based on the research outcome, this study has several policy suggestions. Firstly, the government
should specifically increase the percentage of working people in the eastern and central
regions of China. There are a few ways to achieve this goal. For example, increasing the
birth rate can essentially solve the problem of the future labor force population. It can also
solve the problem of the aging population. The Chinese government has commenced the
three-child policy but that has not improved the country’s birth rate. Therefore, we can deduce
the crucial reason for the decline in the birth rate is that the citizens do not want to have children.
Research by Cai and Wang [52] pointed out that the Chinese government should
improve welfare policies to increase citizens’ willingness to have children. For example,
extending maternity leave and providing paternity leave for men. However, this method

requires a long-term period to work. The increase in the birth rate will also put further pressure
on the currently working people.
Besides that, the Chinese government can promulgate preferential policies to attract foreign
workers. For instance, India has a higher birth rate, and its total population will exceed China’s
population shortly. At present, India has plenty of ready workforce. If the Chinese government
can effectively attract young Indians to work in China, it will immediately increase the percentage
of working people. Nevertheless, this method also has its drawbacks. This method cannot
solely solve the problem of the aging population. Besides, foreign workers’ salaries and
other welfare benefits will cause higher costs for business enterprises. Apart from that, the Chinese
government also can liberalize its immigration policies. If foreign young people emigrate
to China, it will increase the working population, and raise the birth rate in the future. However,
the migration may lead to cultural conflicts in later years.
Secondly, China’s eastern and western regions’ governments should increase the sum of
imports and exports. For example, the government can encourage local companies to sell their
products abroad by implementing policies such as export tax rebates, lower taxes, and exemptions
from rent costs. At the same time, the government also can encourage enterprises to
import some products that have comparative advantages. This practice will save costs because
the enterprises will be able to concentrate on producing products that have absolute advantages
to the country’s economy and its people.
Thirdly, in terms of the western region of China, the government should increase the
opportunity and level of education, reduce the unemployment rate, and attract more business
investments. The above three suggestions have a close connection with each other. For example,
if there are only a small number of enterprises in the western region of China, the rate of
return on education will be relatively lower. It will lead people not to attain higher education.
Besides, if there are hardly any business enterprises, it means that competitiveness among the
people will be higher. It also will lead to a higher unemployment rate. Alternately, if people
only have lower education, business enterprises will not invest in this region. The reason is,
that the workforce is not competent for the job.
Limitation
This study has several limitations: Firstly, public debt plays an essential role in the impact of
the aging population on economic growth. However, due to the lack of data, this study cannot

examine the role of public debt. Secondly, spatial effects also play an essential role in the
impact of the aging population on economic growth. Therefore, subsequent studies will examine
the spatial effects of the aging population. Thirdly, PTR is the piecewise linear regression.
In other words, the relationship between X and Y is divided by M. However, this model does
not examine the function of M. Thus, in the subsequent research, I will follow the research of
Hussain et al. [53] and Xuezhou et al. [54] to research the mediation of the sum of import and
export and the unemployment rate (both are threshold variables of this study). Fourthly, many
scholars, such as Zhang et al. [55], have proved that green energy has a significant effect on
economic development. Besides, the Chinese government announces that China will achieve
carbon neutrality in 2060. Apart from that, the aging population will be more serious in China
as well. Thus, the subsequent research will focus on the mediation effect of the aging population
on green energy and economic development.
