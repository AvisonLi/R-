Background: The population of adults accessing opioid
treatment is growing older, but exact estimates vary
widely, and little is known about the characteristics
of the aging treatment population. Further, there has
been little research regarding the epidemiology, healt
h status, and functional impairments in this population.
Objectives: To determine the utilization of opioid
treatment services by older adults in New York City.
Methods: This study used administrative data from
New York State licensed drug treatment programs to
examine overall age trends and characteristics of older
adults in opioid treatment programs in New York City
from 1996 to 2012. Results: We found significant increases
in utilization of opioid treatment programs by
older adults in New York City. By 2012, those aged
50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment
programs. Among older adults there were notable
shifts in demographic background including gender
and ethnicity, and an increase in self-reported impairments.
Conclusions/Importance: More research is
needed to fully understand the specific characteristics
and needs of older adults with opioid dependence.

INTRODUCTION
Opioid dependence is a chronic condition characterized
by periods of relapse, and accompanied by physical and
mental health problems and social marginalization. The
aging baby-boomer cohort has high rates of substance
use (Patterson & Jeste, 1999) that will place increasing
demands and costs (Rosen, Heberlein, & Engel, 2013)
on the substance abuse treatment system, particularly for

long-term treatment of opioid dependence. Small studies
have found that older adults in methadone maintenance
treatment (MMT) have higher rates of mental health disorders
along with more medical problems, and general
poorer health status compared to younger patients, as well
as premature mortality (Firoz & Carlson, 2004; Lofwall,
Brooner, Bigelow, Kindbom, & Strain, 2005; Rosen,
Smith, & Reynolds, 2008; Fareed, Casarella, Amar, Vayalapalli,
& Drexler, 2009; Jimenez-Trevino et al., 2011).
However, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology
of older adults with opioid dependence, and
little discussion of the models for health care delivery for
this population. Furthermore, there is no research to date
regarding the prevalence of geriatric conditions or cognitive
and physical impairments among older adults in opioid
treatment.
Recent years have seen a nationwide increase in the
proportion of older adults entering substance abuse treatment
programs (Arndt, Clayton, & Schultz, 2011). We
also know that drug use patterns for older adults are
changing; there has been an increase in admissions to
substance abuse treatment for illicit drug use (Loftwall
et al., 2005; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2010) and increased injection drug use
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
2011) for adults over the age of 50. Much of what
we know about individuals in opioid treatment comes
from the treatment episode dataset (TEDS) which is collected
and managed by the Office ofApplied Studies, Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
TEDS collects admission information for individuals admitted
to substance abuse treatment facilities that receive
state or federal funding. While TEDS captures data from
the majority of treatment programs in the United States,
one limitation of the TEDS data is that it only includes
1660
OLDER ADULTS IN NEW YORK CITY OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS 1661
information on treatment admissions, and thus may not
fully capture utilization of substance abuse treatment over
time. Furthermore, studies that use TEDS data to examine
aging trends are limited by defining an older adult as
age greater than 50 or 55 (Lofwall et al., 2005; Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2010;
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
2011).While it may be reasonable to use a lower age
cut off to define “geriatric” in this population given the
possible association of premature mortality with drug dependence
(Neumark, Van Etten, & Anthony, 2000) it may
not fully demonstrate how this population is aging.
Given the lack of research regarding older adults with
opioid dependence and the limitations of existing data, we
analyzed age trends for New York City opioid treatment
programs from 1996–2012, with an emphasis on older
adults. Our purpose was to examine age trends of adults
utilizing opioid treatment programs in New York City.We
also characterize basic demographic, self-reported other
substance use, and self-reported physical impairments.
We chose to study the treatment population in New York
City because it has one of the largest methadone treatment
systems in the United States and has consistently provided
access to treatment in the public system. Furthermore, the
data collected by New York State’s Office of Alcoholism
and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) provides more
descriptive information on the treatment population than
what is available nationally through the TEDS dataset.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This paper presents a descriptive analysis of aging trends,
characteristics, and utilization of opioid treatment programs
by older adults in New York City. We used the
Client Data System (CDS), which is an administrative
dataset of the New York State Department of Health,
OASAS. OASAS provided aggregate data from the CDS
for this study. The study was exempted from IRB review
by the New York University School of Medicine’s Institutional
Review Board, and approved by OASAS.
Client Data System
The CDS tracks all admissions, discharges, and updated
annual status of patients in New York State licensed drug
treatment programs. The CDS gathers all data using a
standardized form. It collects demographic information
including sex, date of birth, and race or ethnicity. The
CDS collects information on substance use behaviors,
broken down by primary, secondary, and tertiary substances
used, including drugs and alcohol. Other opiates
besides heroin include the self-reported choices of nonprescription
methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone, and
other opiate/synthetics. The CDS also collects information
on self-reported physical impairments including hearing,
sight, and mobility through yes/no questions. All data
in the CDS is self-reported by patients to treatment program
staff, who enter it into the centralized database.
Data Analysis
Included in this analysis were data for adults in opioid
treatment programs, which are defined in the dataset
as programs providing MMT, buprenorphine treatment,
and/or psychosocial treatment for opioid dependence.
Data were examined for each year from 1996 to 2012.
Cases were limited to adults residing within the five boroughs
of New York City.
For each calendar year, we used aggregate data from
all unique individuals who received opioid treatment services
throughout that year. To be enrolled in opioid treatment
services, opioid use must be reported as the primary
substance used. The calculated age of individuals in the
dataset was based on their age on the first day of each calendar
year. For individuals who receivedmultiple services
throughout the year, only the cross-sectional data from
the first admission or service of the calendar year for that
individual were used. Demographic information is determined
at the individual’s initial treatment admission and,
therefore, remains the same throughout each year that they
are in treatment. For example, for an individual who entered
treatment in 1995, and remained in treatment continuously
until 2012, their age for each year was estimated
by their age on the first day of each calendar year. The
individual’s other demographic information will be from
the initial admission form in 1995.
To ensure that data are confidential and no unique patient
identifiers are released, OASAS does not release data
for categories having less than 10 individuals. Therefore,
when one category or variable had less than 10 individuals,
it was determined to be too small to report, and it necessitated
removing information for all categories within
that group. The aggregate data was created by OASAS
using the default settings from SAS (Statistical Analysis
Software) with the PROC TABULATE procedure utilized
for missing values, which applied only for the physical
impairment variables and did not impact other variables
analyzed. Other categories, such as tobacco use, were not
examined because data were not collected prior to 2009,
and therefore were not complete for the majority of individuals
in our analysis.
To examine age trends we used age groups of ≤40,
41–49, 50–59, 60–69, and ≥70. For patient characteristics
including sex, race and ethnicity, primary and secondary
substance used, and impairments we examined those aged
50–59, those ≥60, and all ages.
RESULTS
A total of 37,038 unique adult individuals received opioid
treatment in New York City in 1996. Over subsequent
years, the treatment population increased to a peak
of 40,328 adults in 2003 and since then has declined to
34,270 adults in 2012. As illustrated in Figure 1, we observed
a pronounced age trend in this population from
1996 to 2012, with adults aged 50 and higher becoming
the majority treatment population. Specifically, individuals
aged 50–59 increased from 2,892 (7.8% of total patients)
to 12,301 (35.9% of total patients); for patients

aged 60–69, there was an increase from 558 (1.5% of total
patients) to 4,099 (12.0% of total patients); and for patients
≥70, an increase from 65 (0.2% of total patients)
to 370 (1.1% of total patients). During the same period,
those aged ≤40 decreased from 20,804 (56.2% of total
patients) to 7,035 (20.5% of total patients). In 2012, those
aged 50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment
programs.
Table 1 describes the demographic characteristics of
older adults in opioid treatment (age 50–59 and age >60),
and of the general opioid treatment population, over time.
In the older adult population, the proportion of females increased
from 1996 to 2012 (a 10.7% increase in the 50–59
group and a 3.8% increase in the≥60 group).During these
same years, the proportion of female patients declined in
the general treatment population (a 2.8% decrease).
There were also notable shifts in terms of race and
ethnicity. During this period, older adults over the age
of 60 were increasingly white (an increase of 10.3%)
with a decrease in black patients (a decrease of 13.8%).
Meanwhile, for Hispanics there was a small increase from
35.0% in 1996 to 38.8% in 2012. These trends, however,
were different for those aged 50–59. In this age group,
there were smaller decreases in both the white (3.5%) and
black (5.9%) populations, and a larger increase in Hispanic
patients (9.2%). For all age groups, the white population
remained steady (0.4%) with a decrease in black patients
(3.5%) and an increase in Hispanic patients (3.4%)
during the same time period.
Substance Use Characteristics
Table 2 shows that from 1996 to 2012 the predominant
primary substance used on admission for all individuals
in opioid treatment programs was heroin. However, there
was a small rise in the use of other opiates as the primary
substance used for all age groups.
Table 2 also shows the prevalence of secondary substances
used within each age group. The majority of patients
reported use of a secondary drug. The use of cocaine
was overwhelmingly the most frequently reported secondary
substance. In each year, more than 30% of adults
in all age groups reported upon treatment admission that
they used cocaine. There were small increases during this
period in all age groups of reported use of alcohol and
marijuana at the time of treatment admission.
Self-Reported Physical Impairments
In each year, older individuals had consistently higher percentages
of sight and mobility impairments compared to
other age ranges. Data were not available for self-reported
hearing impairments for those ≥60, but there was a slight
increase in those with self-reported hearing impairment
for those 50–59 and all ages from 1996 to 2012. The overall
percentages for hearing impairment appear similar in
2012 with 2.3% for the 50–59 age range, and 2.1% for all
age groups.
Sight and mobility impairments increased for all age
groups from 1996 to 2012. For vision impairment, there
were increases for all age groups from 1.1% to 4.5% and
those aged 50–59 from 2.0% to 5.3% during this same
time period. Vision impairment increased more for older
adults with those ≥60 from 2.4% in 1996 to 6.0% in 2012.
The most prevalent self-reported impairment was in mobility.
For all age groups, there was an increase in mobility
impairment from 2.3% in 1996 to 6.8% in 2012 and those
aged 50–59 from 4.4% in 1996 to 8.6% in 2012. Mobility
impairment increased more for older adults with those
≥60 from 5.1% to 10.7% during this same time period.
DISCUSSION
Contrary to popular perception, the social and health impacts
of opioid dependence are not limited to younger
adults, and are increasingly affecting older populations.
Opioid dependence is a chronic condition that often needs
life-long treatment, and therefore many individuals who
are currently in treatment will remain in treatment as they
age.
Our study of adults in New York City opioid treatment
programs shows a striking increase in the proportion of
older patients in treatment. In 1996, the majority of adults
in opioid treatment were less than 40 years of age, while
in 2012, the majority age group in opioid treatment were
those 50–59, with large increases in those over the age
of 60. In the aging treatment population, older patients
had more self-reported physical impairments. This aging
trend will likely continue into the next decade. The increasing
age of this population in opioid treatment programs,
such as methadone treatment, may demonstrate the
value of such treatment for preserving health. Death rates
are very high in the untreated opioid dependent population,
six times that of an age-matched sample in a British
study (Gossop, Stewart, Treacy, & Marsden, 2002), and
data supports that methadone treatment reduces mortality
(Clausen, Anchersen, & Waal, 2008).
The CDS data also highlights trends in substances used
by this older population in opioid treatment. There appears
to be a small but consistent change in the type of primary
opioid used, with increased reporting of non-heroin
and prescription opioid use since 1996. There is also a
high percentage of multiple drug use by older adults in

opioid treatment programs, particularly cocaine use. The
use of other substances in addition to opioids may have
profound affects on health and complicate treatment. The
issue of polysubstance use has not been fully explored in
this older population.
This study also shows the diversity of the older opioid
treatment population in New York City. Since 1996 there
have been large increases in the Hispanic population receiving
treatment. This highlights the need to further explore
health disparities among this population, and how
to culturally tailor treatment to meet the needs of different
segments of the population. It is unclear, however, how
representative this specific population is to other cities in
the United States.Arecent paper by Cicero et al highlights
the changing demographics of heroin users in the United
States as being primarily white, younger, and living outside
of large metropolitan areas (Cicero, Ellis, Surratt, &
Kurtz, 2014).While there is nationwide growth of a white
and younger population of current heroin users, New York
City continues to serve an aging and majority non-white
population in opioid treatment programs.
There are limitations to this study. Similar to the TEDS
dataset, the CDS data does not fully represent trends
among the in-treatment population, but rather contains a
cross-sectional snapshot of the older population in opioid
treatment programs by year, based on their initial admission
forms. Therefore, these data fail to capture trends in
substance use and physical impairments among those who
remain in treatment over time. The CDS data only captures
individuals receiving treatment in State licensed specialty
treatment programs. The characteristics of individuals
with opioid dependence, who are receiving buprenorphine
treatment in medical settings, or being treated privately,
may differ from the CDS population and are not
represented in this study.
There was a considerable amount of missing data for
the physical impairment variables. Data regarding selfreported
hearing, sight, and mobility impairments on admission
by age group, as described previously, had many
missing values particularly in earlier years. In 1996 there
was 14.0% missing values for self-reported hearing, sight,
and mobility impairment questions. The number missing
decreased every year to 2.6% missing values in 2012 for
all impairment questions. However, the data indicate that
older patients had increased impairments when compared
to the general treatment population, in every year.
Another limitation of the CDS data is its reliance on
patient self-report, which may have recall and socialdesirability
biases. The data is collected by program staff,
which introduces the possibility of varying fidelity in how
the questionnaire is administered. Finally, the CDS does
not contain comprehensive information on medical comorbidities,
which are captured only based on the patient’s
self report and do not specify a diagnosis, or the
degree of impairment.
This study shows that the opioid treatment population
is aging in New York City. It also highlights that there
is much we do not understand about this population. The
CDS only provides a snapshot in time of self-reported demographic,
substance use, and impairment information.
Most prior studies have focused on the mental health
(Lofwall et al., 2005) and selected chronic diseases in
older adults with opioid dependence in methadone maintenance
(Fareed et al., 2009; Maruyama, Macdonald, Borycki,
& Zhao, 2013). There have been no studies on geriatric
conditions and very little research regarding the epidemiology,
health status, and specific health needs, as well
as inconsistent quantitative findings on comorbidities for
this population (Rosen, Hunsaker, Albert, Cornelius, &
Reynolds, 2011).
Prior research indicates that medical comorbidities and
health behaviors associated with prolonged substance use,
including the high prevalence of co-occurring tobacco
use and mental health disorders (Rosen et al., 2008; Fareed
et al., 2009; Maruyama et al., 2013) can accelerate
the decline in health and contribute to frailty (D¨ursteler-
MacFarland, Vogel, Wiesbeck, & Petitjean, 2011; Reece,
2007). In addition, social conditions including homelessness
(Fischer&Breakey, 1991; Song, Safaeian, Strathdee,
Vlahov, & Celentano, 2000), and stigma from society at
large and fromwithin the health care system may also contribute
fragmented medical care (Gourevitch, Chatterji,
Deb, Schoenbaum, & Turner, 2007; Rosen et al., 2011),
and poorer health outcomes. These factors may dramatically
contribute to an increase in multiple chronic conditions,
geriatric conditions, and a decline in function for
adults with opioid dependence as they age.
In order to deliver appropriate care for this aging population,
it is important to understand their specific needs in
terms of functional health, including cognitive and physical
function and chronic disease care. Long-term opioid
replacement therapy with methadone is an effective treatment
for patients with opioid dependence (Ward, Hall,
& Mattick, 1999). It has been shown to improve health,
mental health, and socioeconomic integration (Kleber,
2008), and documented long-term safety (Novick et al.,
1993). MMT is typically delivered through MMT programs,
which have been part of the drug treatment landscape
for decades. MMT programs, which aggregate an
aging cohort of adults with multiple chronic conditions,
and have regular and extended treatment contact longitudinally,
may be optimally positioned to deliver interventions
for this population.
To guide more optimal treatment, using evidence-based
geriatric care processes including addressing geriatric
conditions (Cigolle, Langa, Kabeto, Tian,&Blaum, 2007)
and multiple chronic conditions (Norris et al., 2008) need
to be implemented for this population. Future research
should define the unique needs of multiple chronic disease
management and how to maintain physical and cognitive
function for middle-aged and older adults with opioid dependence.
CONCLUSION
There is an increasing population of older adults in opioid
treatment programs in New York City. This trend is likely
to continue into the next decade. This study demonstrates
the changing characteristics of this older population, and
identifies areas that should be high priority for further
1666 B. HAN ET AL.
study. These include understanding how other substance
use can complicate care and how to address the changing
ethnic and racial demographics of this population in New
York City. Much remains unknown, particularly regarding
geriatric conditions and physical and cognitive function
in this population. Future studies are needed to better
understand the specific and unique health needs of this
growing population from a geriatric perspective. Furthermore,
new models of care are needed to address what is
certain to be increasing levels of morbidity as this population
ages, further emphasizing importance of integrating
chronic disease management and care processes with substance
abuse services.

GLOSSARY
Geriatric conditions: While they continue to lack one
commonly accepted definition, have a number of distinguishing
features that set them apart from other
health conditions: they tend to appear in old age and
are most common among vulnerable populations, have
multiple causes, are many times precipitated by an
acute event, can be episodic in nature and are commonly
followed by a decline in functional health. Common
geriatric conditions include falls and gait disorders,
cognitive impairment, and frailty.

Background: The population of adults accessing opioid
treatment is growing older, but exact estimates vary
widely, and little is known about the characteristics
of the aging treatment population. Further, there has
been little research regarding the epidemiology, healt
h status, and functional impairments in this population.
Objectives: To determine the utilization of opioid
treatment services by older adults in New York City.
Methods: This study used administrative data from
New York State licensed drug treatment programs to
examine overall age trends and characteristics of older
adults in opioid treatment programs in New York City
from 1996 to 2012. Results: We found significant increases
in utilization of opioid treatment programs by
older adults in New York City. By 2012, those aged
50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment
programs. Among older adults there were notable
shifts in demographic background including gender
and ethnicity, and an increase in self-reported impairments.
Conclusions/Importance: More research is
needed to fully understand the specific characteristics
and needs of older adults with opioid dependence.

INTRODUCTION
Opioid dependence is a chronic condition characterized
by periods of relapse, and accompanied by physical and
mental health problems and social marginalization. The
aging baby-boomer cohort has high rates of substance
use (Patterson & Jeste, 1999) that will place increasing
demands and costs (Rosen, Heberlein, & Engel, 2013)
on the substance abuse treatment system, particularly for

Avenue, BCD 615, New York, NY 10016, USA; E-mail: benjamin.han@nuymc.org
long-term treatment of opioid dependence. Small studies
have found that older adults in methadone maintenance
treatment (MMT) have higher rates of mental health disorders
along with more medical problems, and general
poorer health status compared to younger patients, as well
as premature mortality (Firoz & Carlson, 2004; Lofwall,
Brooner, Bigelow, Kindbom, & Strain, 2005; Rosen,
Smith, & Reynolds, 2008; Fareed, Casarella, Amar, Vayalapalli,
& Drexler, 2009; Jimenez-Trevino et al., 2011).
However, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology
of older adults with opioid dependence, and
little discussion of the models for health care delivery for
this population. Furthermore, there is no research to date
regarding the prevalence of geriatric conditions or cognitive
and physical impairments among older adults in opioid
treatment.
Recent years have seen a nationwide increase in the
proportion of older adults entering substance abuse treatment
programs (Arndt, Clayton, & Schultz, 2011). We
also know that drug use patterns for older adults are
changing; there has been an increase in admissions to
substance abuse treatment for illicit drug use (Loftwall
et al., 2005; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2010) and increased injection drug use
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
2011) for adults over the age of 50. Much of what
we know about individuals in opioid treatment comes
from the treatment episode dataset (TEDS) which is collected
and managed by the Office ofApplied Studies, Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
TEDS collects admission information for individuals admitted
to substance abuse treatment facilities that receive
state or federal funding. While TEDS captures data from
the majority of treatment programs in the United States,
one limitation of the TEDS data is that it only includes
1660
OLDER ADULTS IN NEW YORK CITY OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS 1661
information on treatment admissions, and thus may not
fully capture utilization of substance abuse treatment over
time. Furthermore, studies that use TEDS data to examine
aging trends are limited by defining an older adult as
age greater than 50 or 55 (Lofwall et al., 2005; Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2010;
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
2011).While it may be reasonable to use a lower age
cut off to define “geriatric” in this population given the
possible association of premature mortality with drug dependence
(Neumark, Van Etten, & Anthony, 2000) it may
not fully demonstrate how this population is aging.
Given the lack of research regarding older adults with
opioid dependence and the limitations of existing data, we
analyzed age trends for New York City opioid treatment
programs from 1996–2012, with an emphasis on older
adults. Our purpose was to examine age trends of adults
utilizing opioid treatment programs in New York City.We
also characterize basic demographic, self-reported other
substance use, and self-reported physical impairments.
We chose to study the treatment population in New York
City because it has one of the largest methadone treatment
systems in the United States and has consistently provided
access to treatment in the public system. Furthermore, the
data collected by New York State’s Office of Alcoholism
and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) provides more
descriptive information on the treatment population than
what is available nationally through the TEDS dataset.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This paper presents a descriptive analysis of aging trends,
characteristics, and utilization of opioid treatment programs
by older adults in New York City. We used the
Client Data System (CDS), which is an administrative
dataset of the New York State Department of Health,
OASAS. OASAS provided aggregate data from the CDS
for this study. The study was exempted from IRB review
by the New York University School of Medicine’s Institutional
Review Board, and approved by OASAS.
Client Data System
The CDS tracks all admissions, discharges, and updated
annual status of patients in New York State licensed drug
treatment programs. The CDS gathers all data using a
standardized form. It collects demographic information
including sex, date of birth, and race or ethnicity. The
CDS collects information on substance use behaviors,
broken down by primary, secondary, and tertiary substances
used, including drugs and alcohol. Other opiates
besides heroin include the self-reported choices of nonprescription
methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone, and
other opiate/synthetics. The CDS also collects information
on self-reported physical impairments including hearing,
sight, and mobility through yes/no questions. All data
in the CDS is self-reported by patients to treatment program
staff, who enter it into the centralized database.
Data Analysis
Included in this analysis were data for adults in opioid
treatment programs, which are defined in the dataset
as programs providing MMT, buprenorphine treatment,
and/or psychosocial treatment for opioid dependence.
Data were examined for each year from 1996 to 2012.
Cases were limited to adults residing within the five boroughs
of New York City.
For each calendar year, we used aggregate data from
all unique individuals who received opioid treatment services
throughout that year. To be enrolled in opioid treatment
services, opioid use must be reported as the primary
substance used. The calculated age of individuals in the
dataset was based on their age on the first day of each calendar
year. For individuals who receivedmultiple services
throughout the year, only the cross-sectional data from
the first admission or service of the calendar year for that
individual were used. Demographic information is determined
at the individual’s initial treatment admission and,
therefore, remains the same throughout each year that they
are in treatment. For example, for an individual who entered
treatment in 1995, and remained in treatment continuously
until 2012, their age for each year was estimated
by their age on the first day of each calendar year. The
individual’s other demographic information will be from
the initial admission form in 1995.
To ensure that data are confidential and no unique patient
identifiers are released, OASAS does not release data
for categories having less than 10 individuals. Therefore,
when one category or variable had less than 10 individuals,
it was determined to be too small to report, and it necessitated
removing information for all categories within
that group. The aggregate data was created by OASAS
using the default settings from SAS (Statistical Analysis
Software) with the PROC TABULATE procedure utilized
for missing values, which applied only for the physical
impairment variables and did not impact other variables
analyzed. Other categories, such as tobacco use, were not
examined because data were not collected prior to 2009,
and therefore were not complete for the majority of individuals
in our analysis.
To examine age trends we used age groups of ≤40,
41–49, 50–59, 60–69, and ≥70. For patient characteristics
including sex, race and ethnicity, primary and secondary
substance used, and impairments we examined those aged
50–59, those ≥60, and all ages.
RESULTS
A total of 37,038 unique adult individuals received opioid
treatment in New York City in 1996. Over subsequent
years, the treatment population increased to a peak
of 40,328 adults in 2003 and since then has declined to
34,270 adults in 2012. As illustrated in Figure 1, we observed
a pronounced age trend in this population from
1996 to 2012, with adults aged 50 and higher becoming
the majority treatment population. Specifically, individuals
aged 50–59 increased from 2,892 (7.8% of total patients)
to 12,301 (35.9% of total patients); for patients
1662 B. HAN ET AL.
FIGURE 1. Percentage of patients in NYC opioid treatment programs
by age range (1996–2012).
aged 60–69, there was an increase from 558 (1.5% of total
patients) to 4,099 (12.0% of total patients); and for patients
≥70, an increase from 65 (0.2% of total patients)
to 370 (1.1% of total patients). During the same period,
those aged ≤40 decreased from 20,804 (56.2% of total
patients) to 7,035 (20.5% of total patients). In 2012, those
aged 50–59 made up the largest age group in opioid treatment
programs.
Table 1 describes the demographic characteristics of
older adults in opioid treatment (age 50–59 and age >60),
and of the general opioid treatment population, over time.
In the older adult population, the proportion of females increased
from 1996 to 2012 (a 10.7% increase in the 50–59
group and a 3.8% increase in the≥60 group).During these
same years, the proportion of female patients declined in
the general treatment population (a 2.8% decrease).
There were also notable shifts in terms of race and
ethnicity. During this period, older adults over the age
of 60 were increasingly white (an increase of 10.3%)
with a decrease in black patients (a decrease of 13.8%).
Meanwhile, for Hispanics there was a small increase from
35.0% in 1996 to 38.8% in 2012. These trends, however,
were different for those aged 50–59. In this age group,
there were smaller decreases in both the white (3.5%) and
black (5.9%) populations, and a larger increase in Hispanic
patients (9.2%). For all age groups, the white population
remained steady (0.4%) with a decrease in black patients
(3.5%) and an increase in Hispanic patients (3.4%)
during the same time period.
Substance Use Characteristics
Table 2 shows that from 1996 to 2012 the predominant
primary substance used on admission for all individuals
in opioid treatment programs was heroin. However, there
was a small rise in the use of other opiates as the primary
substance used for all age groups.
Table 2 also shows the prevalence of secondary substances
used within each age group. The majority of patients
reported use of a secondary drug. The use of cocaine
was overwhelmingly the most frequently reported secondary
substance. In each year, more than 30% of adults
in all age groups reported upon treatment admission that
they used cocaine. There were small increases during this
period in all age groups of reported use of alcohol and
marijuana at the time of treatment admission.
Self-Reported Physical Impairments
In each year, older individuals had consistently higher percentages
of sight and mobility impairments compared to
other age ranges. Data were not available for self-reported
hearing impairments for those ≥60, but there was a slight
increase in those with self-reported hearing impairment
for those 50–59 and all ages from 1996 to 2012. The overall
percentages for hearing impairment appear similar in
2012 with 2.3% for the 50–59 age range, and 2.1% for all
age groups.
Sight and mobility impairments increased for all age
groups from 1996 to 2012. For vision impairment, there
were increases for all age groups from 1.1% to 4.5% and
those aged 50–59 from 2.0% to 5.3% during this same
time period. Vision impairment increased more for older
adults with those ≥60 from 2.4% in 1996 to 6.0% in 2012.
The most prevalent self-reported impairment was in mobility.
For all age groups, there was an increase in mobility
impairment from 2.3% in 1996 to 6.8% in 2012 and those
aged 50–59 from 4.4% in 1996 to 8.6% in 2012. Mobility
impairment increased more for older adults with those
≥60 from 5.1% to 10.7% during this same time period.
DISCUSSION
Contrary to popular perception, the social and health impacts
of opioid dependence are not limited to younger
adults, and are increasingly affecting older populations.
Opioid dependence is a chronic condition that often needs
life-long treatment, and therefore many individuals who
are currently in treatment will remain in treatment as they
age.
Our study of adults in New York City opioid treatment
programs shows a striking increase in the proportion of
older patients in treatment. In 1996, the majority of adults
in opioid treatment were less than 40 years of age, while
in 2012, the majority age group in opioid treatment were
those 50–59, with large increases in those over the age
of 60. In the aging treatment population, older patients
had more self-reported physical impairments. This aging
trend will likely continue into the next decade. The increasing
age of this population in opioid treatment programs,
such as methadone treatment, may demonstrate the
value of such treatment for preserving health. Death rates
are very high in the untreated opioid dependent population,
six times that of an age-matched sample in a British
study (Gossop, Stewart, Treacy, & Marsden, 2002), and
data supports that methadone treatment reduces mortality
(Clausen, Anchersen, & Waal, 2008).
The CDS data also highlights trends in substances used
by this older population in opioid treatment. There appears
to be a small but consistent change in the type of primary
opioid used, with increased reporting of non-heroin
and prescription opioid use since 1996. There is also a
high percentage of multiple drug use by older adults in

OLDER ADULTS IN NEW YORK CITY OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS 1665
opioid treatment programs, particularly cocaine use. The
use of other substances in addition to opioids may have
profound affects on health and complicate treatment. The
issue of polysubstance use has not been fully explored in
this older population.
This study also shows the diversity of the older opioid
treatment population in New York City. Since 1996 there
have been large increases in the Hispanic population receiving
treatment. This highlights the need to further explore
health disparities among this population, and how
to culturally tailor treatment to meet the needs of different
segments of the population. It is unclear, however, how
representative this specific population is to other cities in
the United States.Arecent paper by Cicero et al highlights
the changing demographics of heroin users in the United
States as being primarily white, younger, and living outside
of large metropolitan areas (Cicero, Ellis, Surratt, &
Kurtz, 2014).While there is nationwide growth of a white
and younger population of current heroin users, New York
City continues to serve an aging and majority non-white
population in opioid treatment programs.
There are limitations to this study. Similar to the TEDS
dataset, the CDS data does not fully represent trends
among the in-treatment population, but rather contains a
cross-sectional snapshot of the older population in opioid
treatment programs by year, based on their initial admission
forms. Therefore, these data fail to capture trends in
substance use and physical impairments among those who
remain in treatment over time. The CDS data only captures
individuals receiving treatment in State licensed specialty
treatment programs. The characteristics of individuals
with opioid dependence, who are receiving buprenorphine
treatment in medical settings, or being treated privately,
may differ from the CDS population and are not
represented in this study.
There was a considerable amount of missing data for
the physical impairment variables. Data regarding selfreported
hearing, sight, and mobility impairments on admission
by age group, as described previously, had many
missing values particularly in earlier years. In 1996 there
was 14.0% missing values for self-reported hearing, sight,
and mobility impairment questions. The number missing
decreased every year to 2.6% missing values in 2012 for
all impairment questions. However, the data indicate that
older patients had increased impairments when compared
to the general treatment population, in every year.
Another limitation of the CDS data is its reliance on
patient self-report, which may have recall and socialdesirability
biases. The data is collected by program staff,
which introduces the possibility of varying fidelity in how
the questionnaire is administered. Finally, the CDS does
not contain comprehensive information on medical comorbidities,
which are captured only based on the patient’s
self report and do not specify a diagnosis, or the
degree of impairment.
This study shows that the opioid treatment population
is aging in New York City. It also highlights that there
is much we do not understand about this population. The
CDS only provides a snapshot in time of self-reported demographic,
substance use, and impairment information.
Most prior studies have focused on the mental health
(Lofwall et al., 2005) and selected chronic diseases in
older adults with opioid dependence in methadone maintenance
(Fareed et al., 2009; Maruyama, Macdonald, Borycki,
& Zhao, 2013). There have been no studies on geriatric
conditions and very little research regarding the epidemiology,
health status, and specific health needs, as well
as inconsistent quantitative findings on comorbidities for
this population (Rosen, Hunsaker, Albert, Cornelius, &
Reynolds, 2011).
Prior research indicates that medical comorbidities and
health behaviors associated with prolonged substance use,
including the high prevalence of co-occurring tobacco
use and mental health disorders (Rosen et al., 2008; Fareed
et al., 2009; Maruyama et al., 2013) can accelerate
the decline in health and contribute to frailty (D¨ursteler-
MacFarland, Vogel, Wiesbeck, & Petitjean, 2011; Reece,
2007). In addition, social conditions including homelessness
(Fischer&Breakey, 1991; Song, Safaeian, Strathdee,
Vlahov, & Celentano, 2000), and stigma from society at
large and fromwithin the health care system may also contribute
fragmented medical care (Gourevitch, Chatterji,
Deb, Schoenbaum, & Turner, 2007; Rosen et al., 2011),
and poorer health outcomes. These factors may dramatically
contribute to an increase in multiple chronic conditions,
geriatric conditions, and a decline in function for
adults with opioid dependence as they age.
In order to deliver appropriate care for this aging population,
it is important to understand their specific needs in
terms of functional health, including cognitive and physical
function and chronic disease care. Long-term opioid
replacement therapy with methadone is an effective treatment
for patients with opioid dependence (Ward, Hall,
& Mattick, 1999). It has been shown to improve health,
mental health, and socioeconomic integration (Kleber,
2008), and documented long-term safety (Novick et al.,
1993). MMT is typically delivered through MMT programs,
which have been part of the drug treatment landscape
for decades. MMT programs, which aggregate an
aging cohort of adults with multiple chronic conditions,
and have regular and extended treatment contact longitudinally,
may be optimally positioned to deliver interventions
for this population.
To guide more optimal treatment, using evidence-based
geriatric care processes including addressing geriatric
conditions (Cigolle, Langa, Kabeto, Tian,&Blaum, 2007)
and multiple chronic conditions (Norris et al., 2008) need
to be implemented for this population. Future research
should define the unique needs of multiple chronic disease
management and how to maintain physical and cognitive
function for middle-aged and older adults with opioid dependence.
CONCLUSION
There is an increasing population of older adults in opioid
treatment programs in New York City. This trend is likely
to continue into the next decade. This study demonstrates
the changing characteristics of this older population, and
identifies areas that should be high priority for further
1666 B. HAN ET AL.
study. These include understanding how other substance
use can complicate care and how to address the changing
ethnic and racial demographics of this population in New
York City. Much remains unknown, particularly regarding
geriatric conditions and physical and cognitive function
in this population. Future studies are needed to better
understand the specific and unique health needs of this
growing population from a geriatric perspective. Furthermore,
new models of care are needed to address what is
certain to be increasing levels of morbidity as this population
ages, further emphasizing importance of integrating
chronic disease management and care processes with substance
abuse services.

OLDER ADULTS IN NEW YORK CITY OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS 1667
GLOSSARY
Geriatric conditions: While they continue to lack one
commonly accepted definition, have a number of distinguishing
features that set them apart from other
health conditions: they tend to appear in old age and
are most common among vulnerable populations, have
multiple causes, are many times precipitated by an
acute event, can be episodic in nature and are commonly
followed by a decline in functional health. Common
geriatric conditions include falls and gait disorders,
cognitive impairment, and frailty.
