Abstract. Levy [Levy H (2016) Aging population, retirement, and risk taking. Management
Sci. 62(5):1415–1430.] proposes asymptotic first-degree stochastic dominance (AFSD) as a
distribution-ranking criterion for all nonsatiable decision makers with infinite investment
horizons. By assuming that the terminal wealth follows a log-normal distribution and that
themarginal utility is bounded, he offers the necessary and sufficient distributional condition
for AFSD. Given Levy’s setting, we provide a counterexample to show that his condition is
not necessary and offer the correct equivalent distributional condition for AFSD.

1. Introduction
Longer life expectancy has become a major challenge in
life-cycle planning, and the optimal investment in the
long run has become an increasingly important concern.
To solve the optimal investment problem with an
indefinitely long horizon, Levy (2016) incorporates the
impacts of an investment horizon into the concept of
stochastic dominance to support the maximum geometricmean
(MGM) strategy as a solution for an aging
population. He establishes a new notion of stochastic
dominance, referred to as “asymptotic first-degree
stochastic dominance” (AFSD).
AFSD is a distribution-ranking criterion that defines
a distribution as dominating another one in terms of
first-degree stochastic dominance (FSD) when the investment
period goes to infinity. Assuming that the
return in each period is independent and identically
log-normally distributed, Levy (2016) claims in his theorem
1 that a strategy dominates others in terms of
AFSD if and only if (iff) it generates a higher geometric
mean and a higher volatility.
Although Levy’s notion of AFSD sheds light on the
solution of the investment decision in the long run, the
distributional condition for AFSD given in his theorem1
is inaccurate. In this comment, we first demonstrate
that higher geometric means and higher volatilities are
not necessary for AFSD. We then show that the correct
condition for AFSD is higher geometric means together
with the same volatilities. Proofs are relegated to the
appendix.
2. A Counterexample to Levy’s Condition
for AFSD
Consider the buy-and-hold strategy: An investor
neither withdraws nor injects new cash into her
portfolio, but keeps reinvesting her portfolio in each
period. Let xt denote the rate of gross return at time t
and WT denote the terminal wealth of a uni-dollar
investment after T periods. The xt’s are independently
and identically distributed. Let U denote the von
Neumann–Morgenstern utility function and FT and
GT denote two cumulative distribution functions of
WT. Then, EFU(WT) and EGU(WT) represent the expected
utility functions of WT under FT and GT,
respectively.
Definition 1 (Levy 2016, p. 1416). FT dominates GT by
AFSD if and only if
lim
T→∞
[EFU(WT) − EGU(WT)] ≥ 0 for all U with U ≥ 0,
and for some nondecreasing U there is a strict
inequality.
2792
To gain tractability, Levy (2016) further assumes that
log xt follows N(μF, σ2
F
) and N(μG, σ2
G
) under F and G,
respectively. The “necessary and sufficient condition” for
AFSD provided by Levy (2016, theorem 1) is as follows:
Alleged Theorem 1 (Levy 2016, p. 1417). Assume an
investment horizon of T periods and that FT and GT are lognormal
distributions. Assume that μF > μG; namely, F has
a higher geometric mean than G. Then, for T→∞, FT and
GT are log-normal distributions, and in this case FT dominates
GT by asymptotic-FSD iff μF > μG and σF ≥ σG,
provided that the marginal utility is bounded.
The following counterexample shows that Levy’s
condition is not necessary.
Counterexample 1. Assume that FT and GT are log-normal
distributions and that the marginal utility is bounded. FT
dominates GT by AFSD if
μF − μG ≥ (σG − σF)
(
σG +
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
σ2
G
+ 2μG
√ )
and σF < σG.
The above case is empirically relevant. For example,
let F and G correspond to the MSCI World index and
the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 index, respectively.
From 1926 to 2010, the annualized means and volatilities
of the rates of returnwere 10.81% and 18.06% for
the MSCI and 9.19% and 19.96% for the S&P 500 (Bodie
et al. 2013, figure 5.3). Assuming that the gross annual
returns of both assets follow log-normal distributions,
we have μF  0.0895, σF  0.1619, μG  0.0715, and
σG  0.1813, which satisfy
μF − μG  0.0180 > 0.0117
 (σG − σF)
(
σG +
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
σ2
G
+ 2μG
√ )
and σF < σG. Thus, if the underlying dynamics of the
two assets persist in the future, then the MSCI dominates
the S&P 500 by AFSD, provided that the marginal
utility is bounded.
3. A New Characterization of AFSD
In Definition 1, there is no additional restriction on the
utility function other than U ≥ 0. This feature shares
the same spirit as the classic concept of FSD in minimizing
specific assumptions about decision-makers’
risk attitudes. However, in the characterization of the
distributional condition, Levy (2016) imposes the restriction
of bounded marginal utility. We now remove
this restriction and offer the true necessary and sufficient
condition for AFSD.
Theorem 1. Assume that FT and GT are log-normal distributions.
FT dominates GT by AFSD, if and only if μF > μG
and σF  σG.
Theorem1 resolves the debate on the optimality of the
MGM strategy in the long run for log-normal distributions.
The MGM strategy—choosing F if μF >μG—is
optimal from the perspective of utility maximization if
and only if σF  σG. Theorem 1 confirms that AFSD
yields exactly the same condition as FSD with a finite
horizon as found by Levy (1973, theorem 4). Conceptually,
AFSD appears to be less demanding than FSD
because it only requires that EFU(WT) ≥ EGU(WT) in
the limit of T→∞ and allows for any violation of
EFU(WT) ≥ EGU(WT) at finite horizons. However, the
potential tolerance of the violation is removed by the
power utility class, with which EFU(WT) <EGU(WT) at
some finite horizon T can lead to limT→∞[EFU(WT) −
EGU(WT)]  −∞. Accordingly, the condition in Levy
(2016) of bounded marginal utility is not innocuous: It
excludes the power utility class, limits the utility loss, and
relaxes the important requirement σF  σG.
Although Theorem 1 spells out the simple distribution
condition ensuring that F is preferable to G
in the long run for all nonsatiated utility maximizers,
the requirement that σF  σG is too restrictive
to implement it in practice. Thus, how to make the
notion of asymptotic stochastic dominance more applicable
through excluding the utility functions that
are less or not at all interesting from a practical or
theoretical perspective is an open question for future
research.

Proof of Counterexample 1. Levy (2016) ignores the possibility
that AFSD can also occur in the case where σF <σG. To

∫ ∞
w0
[GT(w) −

and thus I ≥ 0 while II ≤ 0. As assumed by Levy (2016), letM
denote an upper bound on the marginal utility. The utility
loss II can be controlled by
|II| ≤ M

Remark. Another deficiency in the proof of Levy (2016) is
that Levy’s condition cannot effectively guarantee limT→∞ |I| 

However, Levy’s claim that “limT→∞ w0  0 if μF > σF and
σF > σG” is incorrect. Indeed, limT→∞ w0  0 holds true only if
μF/σF >μG/σG. Otherwise, w0 ≡1 if μF/σF  μG/σG and
limT→∞ w0  ∞if μF/σF < μG/σG. Derivations in the same way

√ (a condition weaker than μF/σF > μG/σG),
then FT dominates GT by AFSD, provided that the marginal
utility is bounded.
Proof of Theorem 1. The “if” part is apparent, because the
distributional condition indeed implies that FT dominates GT
by FSD. To prove the “only if” part, the essential step is to
show that σF  σG must hold true.
If, by contradiction, σF > σG, FT intersects GT from above
and the violation of FSD appears when the wealth is smaller
than the intersection point w0. We can choose a concave
power utility function U(w)  wγ/γ with a sufficiently large
marginal utility in the range of small wealth such that the
utility loss from choosing F grows to infinity as T→∞.
Specifically, let us choose
γ < 2 min μG − μF
σ2
F
− σ2
G
, 0, − μG
σ2
G
{ }
such that μF + γ2
σ2
F < μG + γ2

G < 0. Because

which is a contradiction of Definition 1.
Similarly, if σF < σG, FT intersects GT from below and the
violation of FSD appears when the wealth is larger than w0.
We can instead choose a convex power utility function with
a large enough marginal utility in the range of large wealth
such that the utility loss from choosing F grows to infinity
as T→∞. Specifically, we have 0 <μF + γ2
σ2
F <μG + γ2
