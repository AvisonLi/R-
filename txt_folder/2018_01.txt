Nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent
lower back pain. Although adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-based therapy is regarded to be
promising for the treatment of degenerated NP, there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant
ADSCs into the NP while maintaining cell function. In this study, we developed a type II collagen/chondroitin
sulfate (CS) composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA) delivery system with genipin as the crosslinking
agent. The induction effect of the scaffold on ADSC differentiation was studied in vitro, and a
rat coccygeal vertebrae degeneration model was used to investigate the regenerative effect of the
CCSA system on the degenerated NP in vivo. The results showed that the CCSA delivery system crosslinked
with 0.02% genipin was biocompatible and promoted the expressions of NP-specific genes. After
the injection of the CCSA system, the disc height, water content, extracellular matrix synthesis, and structure
of the degenerated NP were partly restored. Our CCSA delivery system uses minimally invasive
approaches to promote the regeneration of degenerated NP and provides an exciting new avenue for
the treatment of degenerative disc disease.
Statement of Significance
Nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent
lower back pain. Stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method in NP regeneration, but
there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant ADSCs into the NP while maintaining cell function. In
this study, we developed a type II collagen/chondroitin sulfate (CS) composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA)
delivery system with genipin as the cross-linking agent. Although several research groups have studied
the fabrication of injectable hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works. We
chose type II collagen and CS, the two primary native components in the NP, as the main materials
and combined them according to the natural ratio of collagen and sGAG in the NP. The delivery system
is preloaded with ADSCs and can be injected into the NP with a needle, followed by in situ gelation.
Genipin is used as a cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low cytotoxicity. We
investigated the stimulatory effects of our scaffold on the differentiation of ADSCs in vitro and the regenerative
effect of the CCSA delivery system on degenerated NP in vivo.

1. Introduction
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and consequent lower
back pain affect approximately 80% of people at some point in their
lives [1]. The IVD consists of three major components: the inner
nucleus pulposus (NP), the outer annulus fibrosus, and cartilage

endplates [2]. The NP is a highly hydrophilic substance, which contributes
to the flexibility of the spinal column and load-bearing
capacity of the IVD [3]. The degeneration of NP caused by extracellular
matrix (ECM) loss is thought to be the cause of IVD degeneration
[4].
Stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method for
NP regeneration. Bio-scaffolds are essential to transplant stem cells
into specific locations and create an appropriate microenvironment
[5]. Scaffolds fabricated by synthetic polymers such as polylactic
acid [6], polycaprolactone [7], and polyethylene glycol [8]
have good mechanical properties, but have poor cell adhesion
without surface modification. Additionally, the IVD is an avascular
tissue and exchange of substances in this area is difficult [9]; thus,
the synthetic polymers and their degradation products are not easy
to remove. The accumulation of foreign substances may aggravate
the suboptimal microenvironment in the IVD and reduce the pH
and oxygen concentration, thereby inhibiting cell survival [10].
The principle of a bio-scaffold is to emulate the biological environment
of the local tissue [11], and from this point of view, the acellular
NP scaffolds seem to be a good choice. However,
decellularization can cause matrix loss and denaturation [12].
Additionally, allogeneic NP tissues are difficult to obtain. These disadvantages
limit the use of acellular NP scaffolds.
The NP contains an amorphous matrix of highly hydrated proteoglycans
embedded in a loose network of collagen [13]. Proteoglycans
consist of a protein core modified by sulfated
glycosaminoglycans (sGAG). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is the most
important sGAG in the NP and enables the NP to withstand substantial
compressive loads by attracting water [14,15]. The most
abundant collagen type in the NP is type II collagen [16], which
gives the disc its form and tensile strength [13]. Several studies
have demonstrated that the ratio of sGAG to hydroxyproline in
the normal NP is approximately 27:1 [17], and the hydroxyproline
content is equivalent to 10% of the weight of collagen [18]. Using
type II collagen and CS, we can fabricate a scaffold with better biological
properties.
Injectable scaffolds can mostly avoid the degeneration of the
IVD structure during the transplant; hence, hydrogel scaffolds
composed of type II collagen and CS are adequate. An ideal hydrogel
would have low viscosity during injection followed by in situ
gelation, deliver cells, fill micro and macro fissures, and restore disc
height [19]. Cross-linking is the most common approach to stabilize
the biomaterials [20,21]. In addition, the gelation velocity of
many hydrogel scaffolds is regulated by cross-linking. The most
widely used cross-linking treatments can be mainly divided into
two types: chemical and physical. Physical cross-linking methods
such as photo-cross-linking can result in toxicity to the cells being
delivered [22]. Chemical cross-linking is applicable in fixing ECMderived
scaffolds and the agents are mainly classified as chemical
and natural agents. Glutaraldehyde and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl
aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) are representative chemical
agents, and they effectively increase the mechanical stability of
bio-scaffolds. However, the toxicity and induced calcification of
these agents limit long-term implantation [23,24]. Genipin is
obtained from the natural compound geniposide, which is
extracted from the fruit of the Gardenia jasminoides Ellis plant
[25]. Genipin has low toxicity and is regarded as a natural crosslinking
agent; the cross-linking processes are controllable and subtle
and products are stable [25,26].
Type II collagen/CS composite scaffolds have already been
reported in previous studies [27,28]. However, these studies
focused on fabricating three-dimensional porous scaffolds and
the usage of toxic chemical cross-linking agents limits the construction
of the cell delivery system. Genipin at proper concentrations
provides the possibility of fabricating a cell-mixed type II
collagen/CS composite hydrogel, which has no cytotoxicity
towards the delivered cells. Adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) is a
kind of stem cell that is derived from the adipose tissues. ADSCs
have the ability to differentiate into different kinds of cells in specific
environments; hence, they are widely used in stem cell-based
tissue engineering [29,30]. Our previous study has demonstrated
that ADSCs can be guided to differentiate into an NP-like phenotype
with the stimulation of type II collagen [31]. Similar conclusions
have also been reported by other researchers [32]. Thus,
ADSCs are suitable seeding cells in our type II collagen/CS composite
hydrogel-like cell delivery system.
In the current study, we chose type II collagen and CS, the main
components of a healthy NP, and combined them at a specific ratio
according to ECM composition of the NP. A suitable concentration
of genipin was used to cross-link the ADSC mixed type II collagen/
CS hydrogel. We aimed to fabricate an NP-like injectable cell delivery
system based on type II collagen and CS, investigating its biological
effects on ADSCs in vitro and verifying its regenerative
effects on degenerated IVDs. We hope our study will provide
new insights into stem cell-based tissue engineering and the construction
of a ECM-based injectable cell delivery system.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat ADSCs bought from Cyagen Biosciences
(RASMD-01001; Guangzhou, China) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
solution under static conditions in a humidified incubator
at 37 C with 5% CO2. The culture medium was completely replaced
every 3 days, and cells from passages 4–6 were then harvested for
subsequent experiments.
2.2. Scaffold preparation
The type II collagen/CS composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA)
delivery system was prepared by the following steps: First, 6 mg/
mL type II collagen (chicken sternal cartilage; Sigma Aldrich,
USA) and 20 mg/mL CS (Sigma Aldrich) were mixed on ice, and
0.1 M NaOH, 10X PBS, and DMEM were used to adjust the pH to
approximately 7.2. Then, a suspension of ADSCs in DMEM was
added into the mixed solution to a final concentration of 3 mg/
mL type II collagen, 8.1 mg/mL CS, 1X PBS, and 2 * 106/mL ADSCs
[33]. The blank type II collagen/CS composited hydrogel (CCS)
was prepared by the same method except without ADSCs. Various
concentrations of genipin (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 1% w/v; Aladdin,
China) dissolved in 75% EtOH were added into the gel forming
solution for subsequent cross-linking.
2.3. Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of genipin cross-linked scaffolds was determined
after 3, 7, and 14 days of cultivation. The supernatant of
each group was collected and tested for lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) content. The LDH assay kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
China), by following the manufacturer’s protocol, was used
to determine the LDH content. Absorbance values were detected
at 440 nm to reflect the LDH content.
2.4. Cell proliferation
The CCK-8 assay kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Japan) was
used to detect cell proliferation. ADSCs were cultured for 3, 7, and 14
days before determination. At each time point, the complete med-
X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 497
ium was replaced with 200 mL of prepackaged CCK-8 solution (180
mL of DMEM and 20 mL of CCK-8). Each group was incubated at 37 C
under 5% CO2 for 4 h, and then 150 mL of the supernatant was collected
and measured by reading the absorbance values at 450 nm
using a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).
2.5. Gene and protein expression analyses
The CCSA delivery systems were allowed to form gels in 12-well
plates, and equal amount of ADSCs cultured as a monolayer were
served as the control. All the groups were cultured in NP cells
inductive differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 5
mg/mL of transferrin, 5 mg/mL of selenous acid, 0.1 mM dexamethasone,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mM proline, 1.25 mg/mL
BSA, 5 mg/mL insulin, 0.17 mM ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 10 ng/
mL TGF-b3, and 10 ng/mL IGF-1) [34]. The expression levels of target
genes (Table 1) were determined after 7 and 14 days of treatment.
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAiso reagent (TaKaRa
Bio, Japan), followed by reverse transcription utilizing the Prime-
ScriptTM RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa Bio). mRNA was analyzed using
the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA) and SYBR Green (TaKaRa Bio). The housekeeping gene was
18s rRNA, and all of the primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech
(Shanghai, China). The results were calculated using the
2DDCt method.
Protein analysis was carried out after 21 days of treatment. The
total protein in each group was extracted in RIPA buffer containing
1% PMSF, and the concentration was measured by the BCA method.
Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes (Millipore, MA, USA). The membranes were
blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h and were hybridized
overnight at 4 C in TBST with the appropriate primary antibody:
SOX9 (1:1000, Abcam, UK), ACAN (1:1000, Abcam), COL1
(1:1000; Abcam), COL2 (1:5000; Abcam), or GAPDH (1:5000; Santa
Cruz, USA). Then, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000; Santa
Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. The relative
protein levels were quantified by densitometry using Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Munich, Germany).
2.6. Microstructure
Before microstructure observation with scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; SU8010, Hitachi, Japan), samples were frozen
at 80 C and lyophilized for 24 h. Then, all samples were mounted
onto aluminum stubs with carbon tape and sputter coated with a
thin gold film (Emitech, K550) to avoid electrical charging.
2.7. In vitro biodegradation
The stability of scaffolds was determined by measuring the
biodegradation in vitro using bacterial collagenase and chondroitinase
ABC at a concentration of 10 and 0.4 U/mL without the disturbance
of cells [35]. Two hundred microliters of CCS with or without
cross-linking by 0.02% genipin were immersed in 1 mL of enzymatic
digestion solution for up to 24 days. The complete medium
after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 days of incubation was collected for
the next measurement. The hydroxyproline content was detected
to reflect the type II collagen biodegradation using the Hydroxyproline
Assay Kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China).
The CS biodegradation was detected by the 1,9-dimethyl methylene
blue (DMMB) assay [36], and the standard curve was prepared
with CS.
2.8. Evaluation of the degree of cross-linking
A ninhydrin assay was performed to determine the degree of
cross-linking, as previously described [37]. Briefly, 1 mL of ninhydrin
solution (170 mg of ninhydrin and 30 mg of hydrindantin dissolved
in 20 mL of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether) was added
to the samples and incubated in a boiling water bath for 15 min.
The reacted ninhydrin solution was then cooled to room temperature
and diluted in 60% ethanol. The optical absorbance of the solutions
at 570 nm was recorded using a Model 680 microplate reader
(Bio-Rad). The cross-linking degree was calculated using the following
equation:
Cross - linking degree ¼ 1  ODðcross - linkedÞ
ODðnon - cross - linkedÞ
 100%
2.9. Determination of the viscoelastic properties
The viscoelastic properties of samples were determined using a
rheometer (MCR302; Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) with 25 mm paral-

lel plates at 0, 0.1, 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after the hydrogels were crosslinked
with 0.02% genipin. A total of 800 mL of sample was loaded
onto the stage and the upper plate was lowered up to a 1 mm
gap. Strain amplitude sweep mode was chosen, and a sweep strain
from 0.01% to 100% at constant frequency (1 Hz) was performed.
The storage modulus (G0) and loss modulus (G00), which represent
the energy stored and dissipated, respectively [38,39], during the
shear process were recorded. The temperature of tests was controlled
at 37 C.
To determine the gelation time of the CCSA delivery system,
800 mL of sample was loaded on the stage with 1% strain at constant
frequency (1 Hz) at 37C. The change in G0 and G00 was
recorded every 30 s for a duration of 30 min. The gelation time
was determined at the time point when the G0 curve intersected
the G00 curve [40].
2.10. Animal and surgical procedures
SD rats weighting 150 g were used for the in vivo experiments.
All the animals were obtained from the Animal Center of the Academy
of Medical Science of Zhejiang Province, and all procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Zhejiang University. The surgical procedures had already
been reported in our previous study [41]. Anesthesia was administered
by intraperitoneal injection with 1% pentobarbital sodium.
The coccygeal vertebrae (Co)7/Co8 and Co8/Co9 were located by
digital palpation and confirmed by a trial radiograph. A 20-G sterile
needle with an outer diameter of 0.91 mm was inserted through
the AF into the NP at a depth from the skin to the middle of the
disc, which is controlled by a handmade stopper [42,43]. Then,
the needle was rotated 360 and held for 30 s. After 2 weeks, 80
male rats were divided into five groups: the control group (without
needle puncture and other treatments); the degeneration group
(with needle puncture and DMEM injection); the CCS group (with
needle puncture and 0.02% genipin cross-linked CCS injection); the
ADSC group (with needle puncture and ADSC injection); and the
CCSA group (with needle puncture and CCSA delivery system injection).
Injection of the CCS and CCSA was delayed for approximately
5 min to decrease the diffusion of hydrogel. The injection volume
for each group was 2 mL, and a microsyringe attached to a 31-G
needle was used to deliver the materials to the NP [44].
2.11. Cell tracking
To allow cell tracking, the ADSCs were labeled with a fluorescent
intracellular carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester
(CFSE) cell labeling kit (Abcam) by following the manufacturer’s
protocol. At 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injection, specimens were harvested
and cross-sectioned (5 lm) with a freezing microtome
(CM1860; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Then, the specimens were
stained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) for 3 min and observed under
a fluorescence microscope (DM5500, Leica).
2.12. Disc height measurement
A molybdenum target radiographic image unit (GE Mammography
DMR Bucky 18  24, GE Healthcare, UK) was used to detect the
disc height of rats at 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after injection. The rats

were anesthetized and placed in the prone position and kept their
tails straight. A computed radiographic plate system (AGFA Diagnostic
Center Compact Plus, AGFA HealthCare, Belgium) was used
to manipulate the digital images. Disc height index (DHI%)
obtained from digitized radiographs using NIH software was used
to quantitatively describe disc height changes. All image assessments
were conducted by two independent, blinded observers.
2.13. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures and data
processing
T2-weighted sections in the sagittal plane obtained by a 3.0-T
MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems, UK) were used to reveal the
water content and the structure of the NP after 0, 4, 8, and 16
weeks of injection. The rats were anesthetized and placed in the
prone position with their tails straight. The parameter settings
were as follows: spin echo repetition time, 2275 ms; echo time,
80 ms; number of excitations, 8; field of view, 5 cm; slice thickness,
1.5 mm; and no phase wrap. Quantitative analysis of the
image slices was processed using a GE ADW4.2 workstation. The
alterations of the NP were evaluated by the MRI index (the area
of the NP multiplied by average signal intensity) proposed by Sobajima
et al [45]. Two researchers measured the disc height independently
in a blinded fashion.
2.14. Histological analysis
At 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after injection, specimens were harvested
by euthanizing the rats with intraperitoneal injection of
10% chloral hydrate. Specimens were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cross-sectioned (5
lm). Specimens were stained with safranin O–fast green (S-O) or
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The cellularity and morphology of
the IVD were evaluated using a grading scale (Table 2) by two

experienced histology researchers independently in a blinded fashion
as described previously [41].
2.15. Immunohistochemistry, sGAG, and hydroxyproline content
measurement
Specimens were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. After
that, the specimens were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min to inhibit
endogenous peroxidase and were blocked with goat serum for
30 min at room temperature. Then, the specimens were hybridized
with rabbit anti-rat type II collagen antibody (diluted at 1:100;
Abcam) at 4 C overnight. After washing with PBS for 5 min, the
specimens were incubated with goat anti-rabbit second antibody
conjugated with biotin for 1 h at room temperature and were
detected by the SABC method.
The contents of sGAG and hydroxyproline for each group were
detected using the DMMB assay and Hydroxyproline Assay Kit
(Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), respectively, and normalized
with dry weight. The experimental procedures were carried out
following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.16. Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD), and a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The statistical significance of the differences between experimental
groups was assessed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) following the Tukey post hoc test.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software package
(Version 22.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., USA). All experiments
were repeated at least three times using independent samples.
3. Results
3.1. The proper concentration of genipin
The LDH content reflected the cytotoxicity of genipin crosslinked
CCSA system on delivered cells. When the concentration
of genipin was more than 0.02%, the LDH release by ADSCs
increased significantly at each time point, especially on days 7
and 14 (Fig. 1A). In addition, the proliferation of ADSCs decreased
on days 7 and 14, when the concentration of genipin was more
than 0.02%. The concentrations 0.01% and 0.02% showed no significant
difference on cell proliferation on day 7; however, there was
a significant difference on day 14 (Fig. 1B). The microstructure of
noncross-linked CCS was porous, with a smooth and regular skeleton.
However, after genipin was added, the microstructure of the
hydrogel turned tough with twists and the pores became irregular
and indiscernible. As the concentration of genipin increased, the

microstructure transformation of the hydrogel became increasingly
obvious (Fig. 1C–H). Therefore, we considered that the proper
concentration of genipin for cross-linking was 0.02%.
3.2. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of 0.02% genipin
cross-linked CCS or CCSA system
The genipin cross-linked CCSA delivery system formed a gel at
37C; the volume change upon gelation was not significant
(Fig. 2A). We used a rheometer to measure the gelation time of
the CCSA delivery system and found that the gelation time was
approximately 6 min and the G0 was approximately 5.91 Pa (Fig.
2B). The stability of the scaffolds was determined in vitro using
bacterial collagenase and chondroitinase ABC without disturbing
the cells. After cross-linking with 0.02% genipin, the stability of
CCS increased obviously (Fig. 2C). The type II collagen and CS remnants
of genipin cross-linked CCSs were approximately 26% and
40%, respectively, after 24 days, which were significantly higher
than that of noncross-linked scaffold (approximately 10% and
14%, respectively). The ADSC-laden CCS showed higher values of
G0 and G00 than those of blank CCS, but the difference was not significant.
When the CCSA delivery system was mixed, the value of
G00 (2.45 ± 0.16 Pa) was higher than G0 (1.30 ± 0.14 Pa). At 0.1 h,
the value of G00 (6.04 ± 0.20 Pa) turned nearly equal to G0 (6.14 ±
0.20 Pa). G0 remained higher than G00 after gelation for 1 h, and
the values were 2488.94 ± 45.67 and 231.03 ± 1.89 Pa, respectively,
at 48 h (Fig. 2D). As cross-linking time extended, the cross-linking
degree increased and the existence of ADSCs did not influence the
cross-linking degree. The values were, respectively, 37% ± 2% and
36% ± 2% (ADSCs laden and free) at 72 h (Fig. 2E). We also observed
the cellular morphology of ADSCs in the cell delivery system, and
the results showed that ADSC appeared to have a spherical shape,
distinctly different from the shape on monolayer culture (Fig. 2F).
3.3. In vitro study of the effects of CCSA delivery system on the laden
ADSCs
The gene and protein expression levels of aggrecan, SOX9, COL2,
and COL1 represent the matrix synthesis function of ADSCs. The
0.02% genipin cross-linked CCSA group showed higher gene
expression level of Acan than the other two groups on days 7 and
14 (Fig. 3A), which is similar to that of Sox9 (Figure 3B). The 0%
and 0.02% genipin group exhibited no significant difference in
Col2 expression on day 7, but there was a significant difference
on day 14 (Fig. 3C). All groups had no significant difference in
Col1 expression on day 7 or 14 (Fig. 3D). The protein expression
levels were similar to those of the relevant gene markers. The
0.02% genipin group showed significantly higher expression of
aggrecan than that of the control and 0% genipin groups. The 0%
and 0.02% genipin groups had similar expression levels of COL2
and SOX9 but were higher than those of the control group (Fig.
3E). Krt19 and Pax1 are specific gene markers of NP cells, while
Gdf10 specifically indicates the chondrogenic differentiation of
ADSCs [46,47]. The expression level of Krt19 in the 0.02% genipin
group was almost 3.29- and 4.87-fold higher than that of 0% genipin
and the control group, respectively, on day 14 (Fig. 3F). The
gene expression level of Pax1 in the 0.02% genipin group was
almost 4.99- and 11.62-fold higher than that of the control group
on days 7 and 14, respectively, and 2.44-fold higher than that of
the 0% genipin group on day 14 (Fig. 3G). There was no significant
difference between the three groups in the gene expression level of
Gdf10 (Fig. 3H).
3.4. Tracking injected ADSCs
CFSE-positive ADSCs could only be identified in the ADSC and
CCSA groups. The CFSE-positive ADSCs delivered by CCS remained
in clusters in the first week after injection, and the ADSCs delivered
Fig. 4. CFSE-positive ADSCs glowed green fluorescence in the NP at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injection. The fluorescence in the control, degeneration, CCS, ADSC, and CCSA
groups were detected. The nuclei of native and injected cells were stained blue. White arrows indicate CFSE-positive ADSCs. Scale bar = 100 mm.
502 X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509
without CCS appeared to have migrated and spread to the whole
NP. Two weeks after injection, some CFSE-positive ADSCs incorporated
in the CCS have also migrated to the distant sites. The CFSEpositive
ADSCs could be identified throughout the 4 weeks in culture
in both the ADSC and CCSA groups (Fig. 4).
3.5. Radiographic and MRI assessment of disc in different groups
As shown in Fig. 5, the DHI% in the degeneration, CCS, ADSC, and
CCSA groups were significantly lower than that in the control
group immediately after injection. Compared with the degenera-

tion and ADSC groups, the DHI% of the CCSA group was significantly
higher at weeks 4, 8, and 16. Moreover, the CCSA group
showed a higher DHI% than the CCS group at weeks 8 and 16. Interestingly,
there was no significant difference between the control
group and CCSA group at weeks 4 and 8, but there was a difference
at week 16 (100% ± 1% and 83% ± 2%, respectively). The MRI results,

which revealed the water content and structure of the NP, are
shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the control group, the other groups
had lower MRI indices at each time point. The degeneration group
had lower MRI index than that of the CCS, ADSC, and CCSA groups
at weeks 4, 8, and 16. Significant changes in the MRI index in the
CCSA group were observed at weeks 8 and 16 (2631.41 ± 159.76

and 2528.16 ± 201.01, respectively), compared with the CCS
(1751.53 ± 10.31 and 1064.39 ± 212.98, respectively) and ADSC
groups (1477.93 ± 36.87 and 934.21 ± 20.23, respectively). The T2
signal range was significantly decreased in the degeneration group
compared with the control group at week 16. Moreover, the T2 signal
range of the CCSA group was still inferior to that of the control
group but superior to those of the CCS and ADSC groups.
3.6. Histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of
the NP
The HE staining (Fig. 7A) showed that the normal NP was well
organized with cells and ECM. However, in the degeneration group,
the structure of the NP was destroyed and the lamellar sheets of AF
were disorganized. After 16 weeks of injection, the injured parts of
the NP in the degeneration, CCS, and ADSC groups were filled with
fibrous connective tissues, and the structure of the NP was indiscernible.
However, in the CCSA group, the cell and ECM distributions
were clear and more regular than those of the degeneration
group. A reduced matrix staining for proteoglycans was clearly
observed in the degeneration, CCS, and ADSC groups from the
images of S-O staining. The CCSA group demonstrated that the
degenerated NP was regenerated to some extent, with stronger
staining than the degeneration group (Fig. 7B).
The distribution of type II collagen was also detected at weeks 0
and 16. Type II collagen was only distinctly expressed in the control
and CCSA groups after 16 weeks of injection, and it was mainly
accumulated around cells. Few areas were immune positive for

group.

type II collagen in the CCS and ADSC groups, which indicated that
the normal structure of the NP did not exist (Fig. 8A). The contents
of sGAG at weeks 0 and 16 were measured by the DMMB assay and
were normalized to NP dry weight. The control group had higher
sGAG content than all the other groups at weeks 0 and 16. The
sGAG content of the CCSA group significantly increased compared
with that of the degeneration group at week 16. The CCSA group
also exhibited higher sGAG content than the CCS and ADSC groups.
We also quantified the content of type II collagen by measuring the
hydroxyproline content in the NP. The hydroxyproline content was
normalized to NP dry weight. The hydroxyproline content of the
control group was significantly higher than all the other groups
at weeks 0 and 16. Moreover, the CCSA group exhibited a significant
increase in hydroxyproline content compared with the degeneration
group as well as with the CCS and ADSC groups at week 16
(Fig. 8C).
We used the histological grading scale to comprehensively evaluate
the degeneration of discs. The normal NP showed regular
structure of the NP and AF, distributed with NP cells, and the water
content of the NP and disc height were normal. The histological
score of the control group was 5.2 ± 0.5. In the degeneration group,
the structure and composition of the NP was abnormal and the
degenerated sites were occupied by fibrocartilaginous tissue and
cells with different cellular morphology. The histological score of
the degeneration group was 12.8 ± 0.8, which was significantly
higher than that of the control group. The CCSA group had
increased disc height and water content when compared to those
of the degeneration group. In addition, the structure and ECM of
the NP were also partly recovered in the CCSA group at week 16.
Compared with the CCS and ADSC groups (9.8 ± 0.8 and 10.2 ±
1.3, respectively), the CCSA group had a significantly lower histological
score (7.4 ± 1.1), but it was still higher than the score of
the control group, which suggested that the discs in the CCSA
group still partly displayed the characteristics of degeneration
(Fig. 8D).
4. Discussion
A decrease in NP cells and a disruption of ECM occur during the
process of NP degeneration, which is responsible for IVD degeneration
and, consequently, lower back pain [48,49]. Stem cell transplantation
showed good results in increasing ECM, as the stem
cells can differentiate into an NP-like phenotype [50]. Although
several research groups have studied the fabrication of injectable
hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works
[28,51]. We chose type II collagen and CS, the two primary native
components in the NP as the main materials and combined them
according to the natural ratio of collagen and sGAG in the NP.
The CCS is preloaded with ADSCs and can be injected into the NP
with needle, followed by in situ gelation. Genipin is used as a
cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low
cytotoxicity. Moreover, we investigated the stimulatory effects of
our scaffold on ADSC differentiation in vitro and the regenerative
effect of CCSA delivery system on degenerated NP in vivo. The rat
tail disc degeneration model has been used in many studies
because of its greatly simplified procedure; hence, we chose the
rat tail discs to perform injections [52,53].
Although genipin is regarded as a less toxic cross-linker for
cells, high concentration is inadvisable when mixed directly
together with cells. The cross-linking degree of 0.02% genipin
was nearly 37%, and the type II collagen and CS remnants after
24 days of biodegradation were nearly 26% and 40%, respectively.
Higher concentrations of genipin can increase the cross-linking
degree and biostability of the scaffold [54], but they increase cytotoxicity
and change surface characteristics of the scaffold as well.
The function of ADSCs is more important in stem cell-based tissue
engineering; hence, we consider a concentration of 0.02% (the corresponding
concentration of EtOH is 0.075%, which is also safe to
ADSCs; Supplemental Fig. 1) to be optimal for the cross-linking
of the CCSA delivery system.
Cell shape and matrix stiffness influence the differentiation of
stem cells [55–57]. A spherical morphology associated with a dispersed
actin cytoskeleton with few focal adhesions stimulates the
chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in
addition to the osteogenic differentiation [58]. Moreover, several
studies have also reported that substrates with low stiffness are
more favorable for NP-like differentiation [22,59]. Our in vitro
study has demonstrated the CCS can induce the loaded ADSCs to
differentiate into an NP-like phenotype and increase ECM synthesis.
We consider that the stimulation effect of CCS is associated
with the low stiffness exhibited by CCS and the spherical shape
of ADSCs. The NP-like phenotype and chondrogenic phenotype
are difficult to distinguish, as both NP cells and chondrocytes
express high levels of Sox9, Acan, Col2, and their corresponding proteins
[47,60,61]. Krt19 and Pax1 are characteristic genes in NP cells,
which have the potential to characterize human NP cells [46,62].
Gdf10 is a novel chondrocyte marker that is expressed more than
100-fold in chondrocytes than in NP cells [46]. With the help of
these specific gene markers, we clarified the differentiation status
of ADSCs.
The results of CFSE-positive ADSCs delivered by CCS, which
remained in clusters 1 week after injection, demonstrated that
the scaffold turned into gel in situ and restrained the migration
of ADSCs. Over time, the biodegradation of CCS was enhanced,
and ADSCs migrated to other locations of the NP. The fluorescence
intensity and number of CFSE-positive ADSCs injected with CCS
decreased significantly at the 4th week after injection, but it did
not mean that the ADSCs had disappeared. CFSE-positive ADSCs
had the intracellular fluorescent label that was incorporated in a
stable form but decreased over time as a function of dilution with
cell division. The CCSA group showed significant regeneration after
16 weeks, which means the ADSCs were functional; we considered
that cell division was the reason for the decreased fluorescence
intensity and the decreased number of CFSE-positive ADSCs we
observed at week 4.
Our in vivo study results showed some characteristics of the
degenerated disc, such as a decrease in disc height; a decrease in
ECM, water content, and NP cells in the NP; and the abnormal
structure of the NP. CCS alone could increase disc height and NP
water content in a short time. We think this finding is due to the
CCS being a hydrogel, which has a high proportion of water. Moreover,
the CCS in the NP exhibited a G0 relatively higher than G00 ,
indicating the CCS presented in a more solid-like form and could
buffer the pressure on the disc [38]. However, the CCS did not
regenerate the degenerated NP essentially; hence, the disc height
and NP water content of the CCS group showed no significant difference
in the degeneration group after a long-term treatment
owing to the biodegradation of CCS. Degenerated NP had a suboptimal
environment (low oxygen tension, limited nutrition, acidic
pH, and high osmolarity), which showed a negatively influence
on the function or even survival of the transplanted cells [63–
65]. ADSCs injected without the scaffold showed no obvious regenerative
effect in the NP because ADSCs experienced the difficulty in
surviving and synthesizing matrix in a harsh environment [66].
Our CCS provides adherent sites for ADSCs and is likely to stimulate
the differentiation of ADSCs into an NP-like phenotype; hence, the
cells we injected survived, synthesized the matrix, and regenerated
the degenerated NP. The histological score is based on five categories
of degenerative changes and range from 5 points for a normal
disc to 15 points for a severely degenerated disc. The CCSA
group showed a decrease in histological score after 16 weeks,
X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 507
which means that the degenerated NP was repaired to some
extent, displaying increased disc height, water content, proteoglycan
and type II collagen synthesis, and recovery of NP structure.
However, there is still a gap between the normal and regenerated
NP, as the histological score of the CCSA group was still higher than
that of the control group.
We used needle puncture to inject our CCSA delivery system
through the AF into the NP in this study. Several studies have
reported that the needle puncture in healthy IVDs could lead to a
loss of tissue functionality and disc pressure [67]. However, the
degenerated disc, on its own, causes matrix degradation and
reduced disc height [68,69]. The processes of delivering CCSA system
through injection is unlikely to aggravate the matrix loss but
will provide biological benefits to the degenerated NP. The limitations
of our CCSA delivery system in clinical application are the low
collagen content (3 mg/mL) in the hydrogel and low mechanical
property. Studies have demonstrated that NP acts as a cushion
with shock-absorbing properties [70,71]. The modulus of the
healthy NP is approximately 11 kPa [72], which is significantly
higher than that in our CCSA group. While stimulating NP-like differentiation
of ADSCs, the low collagen density of our CCSA delivery
system loses mechanical support and it is difficult to stabilize
a degenerated disc. More research should be carried out to improve
the inducing efficiency of NP-like differentiation and the mechanical
property of our CCSA delivery system together.
5. Conclusion
In this study, we fabricated a novel scaffold with type II collagen
and CS to deliver ADSCs through needle injection. The CCS we fabricated
is cross-linked with 0.02% genipin and has the ability of
in situ gelation after injection. Although the cross-linking degree
is low, the CCS showed an increased bio-stability and solid-like
properties after gelation. Our in vitro results demonstrated the
bio-safety of the CCS on ADSCs and the stimulation effects of the
scaffold on the differentiation of ADSCs. We further studied the
regenerative effects of the CCSA delivery system on the degenerated
NP in an animal model, and we demonstrated that the CCSA
delivery system could partly regenerate the degenerated NP. We
hope our study can provide new insights into the clinical application
of stem cell-based tissue engineering for the treatment of IVD
degeneration.

Nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent
lower back pain. Although adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-based therapy is regarded to be
promising for the treatment of degenerated NP, there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant
ADSCs into the NP while maintaining cell function. In this study, we developed a type II collagen/chondroitin
sulfate (CS) composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA) delivery system with genipin as the crosslinking
agent. The induction effect of the scaffold on ADSC differentiation was studied in vitro, and a
rat coccygeal vertebrae degeneration model was used to investigate the regenerative effect of the
CCSA system on the degenerated NP in vivo. The results showed that the CCSA delivery system crosslinked
with 0.02% genipin was biocompatible and promoted the expressions of NP-specific genes. After
the injection of the CCSA system, the disc height, water content, extracellular matrix synthesis, and structure
of the degenerated NP were partly restored. Our CCSA delivery system uses minimally invasive
approaches to promote the regeneration of degenerated NP and provides an exciting new avenue for
the treatment of degenerative disc disease.
Statement of Significance
Nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is usually the origin of intervertebral disc degeneration and consequent
lower back pain. Stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method in NP regeneration, but
there is a lack of viable cell carriers to transplant ADSCs into the NP while maintaining cell function. In
this study, we developed a type II collagen/chondroitin sulfate (CS) composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA)
delivery system with genipin as the cross-linking agent. Although several research groups have studied
the fabrication of injectable hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works. We
chose type II collagen and CS, the two primary native components in the NP, as the main materials
and combined them according to the natural ratio of collagen and sGAG in the NP. The delivery system
is preloaded with ADSCs and can be injected into the NP with a needle, followed by in situ gelation.
Genipin is used as a cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low cytotoxicity. We
investigated the stimulatory effects of our scaffold on the differentiation of ADSCs in vitro and the regenerative
effect of the CCSA delivery system on degenerated NP in vivo.

1. Introduction
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and consequent lower
back pain affect approximately 80% of people at some point in their
lives [1]. The IVD consists of three major components: the inner
nucleus pulposus (NP), the outer annulus fibrosus, and cartilage

endplates [2]. The NP is a highly hydrophilic substance, which contributes
to the flexibility of the spinal column and load-bearing
capacity of the IVD [3]. The degeneration of NP caused by extracellular
matrix (ECM) loss is thought to be the cause of IVD degeneration
[4].
Stem cell-based tissue engineering is a promising method for
NP regeneration. Bio-scaffolds are essential to transplant stem cells
into specific locations and create an appropriate microenvironment
[5]. Scaffolds fabricated by synthetic polymers such as polylactic
acid [6], polycaprolactone [7], and polyethylene glycol [8]
have good mechanical properties, but have poor cell adhesion
without surface modification. Additionally, the IVD is an avascular
tissue and exchange of substances in this area is difficult [9]; thus,
the synthetic polymers and their degradation products are not easy
to remove. The accumulation of foreign substances may aggravate
the suboptimal microenvironment in the IVD and reduce the pH
and oxygen concentration, thereby inhibiting cell survival [10].
The principle of a bio-scaffold is to emulate the biological environment
of the local tissue [11], and from this point of view, the acellular
NP scaffolds seem to be a good choice. However,
decellularization can cause matrix loss and denaturation [12].
Additionally, allogeneic NP tissues are difficult to obtain. These disadvantages
limit the use of acellular NP scaffolds.
The NP contains an amorphous matrix of highly hydrated proteoglycans
embedded in a loose network of collagen [13]. Proteoglycans
consist of a protein core modified by sulfated
glycosaminoglycans (sGAG). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is the most
important sGAG in the NP and enables the NP to withstand substantial
compressive loads by attracting water [14,15]. The most
abundant collagen type in the NP is type II collagen [16], which
gives the disc its form and tensile strength [13]. Several studies
have demonstrated that the ratio of sGAG to hydroxyproline in
the normal NP is approximately 27:1 [17], and the hydroxyproline
content is equivalent to 10% of the weight of collagen [18]. Using
type II collagen and CS, we can fabricate a scaffold with better biological
properties.
Injectable scaffolds can mostly avoid the degeneration of the
IVD structure during the transplant; hence, hydrogel scaffolds
composed of type II collagen and CS are adequate. An ideal hydrogel
would have low viscosity during injection followed by in situ
gelation, deliver cells, fill micro and macro fissures, and restore disc
height [19]. Cross-linking is the most common approach to stabilize
the biomaterials [20,21]. In addition, the gelation velocity of
many hydrogel scaffolds is regulated by cross-linking. The most
widely used cross-linking treatments can be mainly divided into
two types: chemical and physical. Physical cross-linking methods
such as photo-cross-linking can result in toxicity to the cells being
delivered [22]. Chemical cross-linking is applicable in fixing ECMderived
scaffolds and the agents are mainly classified as chemical
and natural agents. Glutaraldehyde and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl
aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) are representative chemical
agents, and they effectively increase the mechanical stability of
bio-scaffolds. However, the toxicity and induced calcification of
these agents limit long-term implantation [23,24]. Genipin is
obtained from the natural compound geniposide, which is
extracted from the fruit of the Gardenia jasminoides Ellis plant
[25]. Genipin has low toxicity and is regarded as a natural crosslinking
agent; the cross-linking processes are controllable and subtle
and products are stable [25,26].
Type II collagen/CS composite scaffolds have already been
reported in previous studies [27,28]. However, these studies
focused on fabricating three-dimensional porous scaffolds and
the usage of toxic chemical cross-linking agents limits the construction
of the cell delivery system. Genipin at proper concentrations
provides the possibility of fabricating a cell-mixed type II
collagen/CS composite hydrogel, which has no cytotoxicity
towards the delivered cells. Adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) is a
kind of stem cell that is derived from the adipose tissues. ADSCs
have the ability to differentiate into different kinds of cells in specific
environments; hence, they are widely used in stem cell-based
tissue engineering [29,30]. Our previous study has demonstrated
that ADSCs can be guided to differentiate into an NP-like phenotype
with the stimulation of type II collagen [31]. Similar conclusions
have also been reported by other researchers [32]. Thus,
ADSCs are suitable seeding cells in our type II collagen/CS composite
hydrogel-like cell delivery system.
In the current study, we chose type II collagen and CS, the main
components of a healthy NP, and combined them at a specific ratio
according to ECM composition of the NP. A suitable concentration
of genipin was used to cross-link the ADSC mixed type II collagen/
CS hydrogel. We aimed to fabricate an NP-like injectable cell delivery
system based on type II collagen and CS, investigating its biological
effects on ADSCs in vitro and verifying its regenerative
effects on degenerated IVDs. We hope our study will provide
new insights into stem cell-based tissue engineering and the construction
of a ECM-based injectable cell delivery system.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat ADSCs bought from Cyagen Biosciences
(RASMD-01001; Guangzhou, China) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
solution under static conditions in a humidified incubator
at 37 C with 5% CO2. The culture medium was completely replaced
every 3 days, and cells from passages 4–6 were then harvested for
subsequent experiments.
2.2. Scaffold preparation
The type II collagen/CS composite hydrogel-like ADSC (CCSA)
delivery system was prepared by the following steps: First, 6 mg/
mL type II collagen (chicken sternal cartilage; Sigma Aldrich,
USA) and 20 mg/mL CS (Sigma Aldrich) were mixed on ice, and
0.1 M NaOH, 10X PBS, and DMEM were used to adjust the pH to
approximately 7.2. Then, a suspension of ADSCs in DMEM was
added into the mixed solution to a final concentration of 3 mg/
mL type II collagen, 8.1 mg/mL CS, 1X PBS, and 2 * 106/mL ADSCs
[33]. The blank type II collagen/CS composited hydrogel (CCS)
was prepared by the same method except without ADSCs. Various
concentrations of genipin (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 1% w/v; Aladdin,
China) dissolved in 75% EtOH were added into the gel forming
solution for subsequent cross-linking.
2.3. Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of genipin cross-linked scaffolds was determined
after 3, 7, and 14 days of cultivation. The supernatant of
each group was collected and tested for lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) content. The LDH assay kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
China), by following the manufacturer’s protocol, was used
to determine the LDH content. Absorbance values were detected
at 440 nm to reflect the LDH content.
2.4. Cell proliferation
The CCK-8 assay kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Japan) was
used to detect cell proliferation. ADSCs were cultured for 3, 7, and 14
days before determination. At each time point, the complete med-
X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 497
ium was replaced with 200 mL of prepackaged CCK-8 solution (180
mL of DMEM and 20 mL of CCK-8). Each group was incubated at 37 C
under 5% CO2 for 4 h, and then 150 mL of the supernatant was collected
and measured by reading the absorbance values at 450 nm
using a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).
2.5. Gene and protein expression analyses
The CCSA delivery systems were allowed to form gels in 12-well
plates, and equal amount of ADSCs cultured as a monolayer were
served as the control. All the groups were cultured in NP cells
inductive differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 5
mg/mL of transferrin, 5 mg/mL of selenous acid, 0.1 mM dexamethasone,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mM proline, 1.25 mg/mL
BSA, 5 mg/mL insulin, 0.17 mM ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 10 ng/
mL TGF-b3, and 10 ng/mL IGF-1) [34]. The expression levels of target
genes (Table 1) were determined after 7 and 14 days of treatment.
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAiso reagent (TaKaRa
Bio, Japan), followed by reverse transcription utilizing the Prime-
ScriptTM RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa Bio). mRNA was analyzed using
the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA) and SYBR Green (TaKaRa Bio). The housekeeping gene was
18s rRNA, and all of the primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech
(Shanghai, China). The results were calculated using the
2DDCt method.
Protein analysis was carried out after 21 days of treatment. The
total protein in each group was extracted in RIPA buffer containing
1% PMSF, and the concentration was measured by the BCA method.
Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes (Millipore, MA, USA). The membranes were
blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h and were hybridized
overnight at 4 C in TBST with the appropriate primary antibody:
SOX9 (1:1000, Abcam, UK), ACAN (1:1000, Abcam), COL1
(1:1000; Abcam), COL2 (1:5000; Abcam), or GAPDH (1:5000; Santa
Cruz, USA). Then, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000; Santa
Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. The relative
protein levels were quantified by densitometry using Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Munich, Germany).
2.6. Microstructure
Before microstructure observation with scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; SU8010, Hitachi, Japan), samples were frozen
at 80 C and lyophilized for 24 h. Then, all samples were mounted
onto aluminum stubs with carbon tape and sputter coated with a
thin gold film (Emitech, K550) to avoid electrical charging.
2.7. In vitro biodegradation
The stability of scaffolds was determined by measuring the
biodegradation in vitro using bacterial collagenase and chondroitinase
ABC at a concentration of 10 and 0.4 U/mL without the disturbance
of cells [35]. Two hundred microliters of CCS with or without
cross-linking by 0.02% genipin were immersed in 1 mL of enzymatic
digestion solution for up to 24 days. The complete medium
after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 days of incubation was collected for
the next measurement. The hydroxyproline content was detected
to reflect the type II collagen biodegradation using the Hydroxyproline
Assay Kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China).
The CS biodegradation was detected by the 1,9-dimethyl methylene
blue (DMMB) assay [36], and the standard curve was prepared
with CS.
2.8. Evaluation of the degree of cross-linking
A ninhydrin assay was performed to determine the degree of
cross-linking, as previously described [37]. Briefly, 1 mL of ninhydrin
solution (170 mg of ninhydrin and 30 mg of hydrindantin dissolved
in 20 mL of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether) was added
to the samples and incubated in a boiling water bath for 15 min.
The reacted ninhydrin solution was then cooled to room temperature
and diluted in 60% ethanol. The optical absorbance of the solutions
at 570 nm was recorded using a Model 680 microplate reader
(Bio-Rad). The cross-linking degree was calculated using the following
equation:
Cross - linking degree ¼ 1  ODðcross - linkedÞ
ODðnon - cross - linkedÞ
 100%
2.9. Determination of the viscoelastic properties
The viscoelastic properties of samples were determined using a
rheometer (MCR302; Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) with 25 mm paral-

lel plates at 0, 0.1, 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after the hydrogels were crosslinked
with 0.02% genipin. A total of 800 mL of sample was loaded
onto the stage and the upper plate was lowered up to a 1 mm
gap. Strain amplitude sweep mode was chosen, and a sweep strain
from 0.01% to 100% at constant frequency (1 Hz) was performed.
The storage modulus (G0) and loss modulus (G00), which represent
the energy stored and dissipated, respectively [38,39], during the
shear process were recorded. The temperature of tests was controlled
at 37 C.
To determine the gelation time of the CCSA delivery system,
800 mL of sample was loaded on the stage with 1% strain at constant
frequency (1 Hz) at 37C. The change in G0 and G00 was
recorded every 30 s for a duration of 30 min. The gelation time
was determined at the time point when the G0 curve intersected
the G00 curve [40].
2.10. Animal and surgical procedures
SD rats weighting 150 g were used for the in vivo experiments.
All the animals were obtained from the Animal Center of the Academy
of Medical Science of Zhejiang Province, and all procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Zhejiang University. The surgical procedures had already
been reported in our previous study [41]. Anesthesia was administered
by intraperitoneal injection with 1% pentobarbital sodium.
The coccygeal vertebrae (Co)7/Co8 and Co8/Co9 were located by
digital palpation and confirmed by a trial radiograph. A 20-G sterile
needle with an outer diameter of 0.91 mm was inserted through
the AF into the NP at a depth from the skin to the middle of the
disc, which is controlled by a handmade stopper [42,43]. Then,
the needle was rotated 360 and held for 30 s. After 2 weeks, 80
male rats were divided into five groups: the control group (without
needle puncture and other treatments); the degeneration group
(with needle puncture and DMEM injection); the CCS group (with
needle puncture and 0.02% genipin cross-linked CCS injection); the
ADSC group (with needle puncture and ADSC injection); and the
CCSA group (with needle puncture and CCSA delivery system injection).
Injection of the CCS and CCSA was delayed for approximately
5 min to decrease the diffusion of hydrogel. The injection volume
for each group was 2 mL, and a microsyringe attached to a 31-G
needle was used to deliver the materials to the NP [44].
2.11. Cell tracking
To allow cell tracking, the ADSCs were labeled with a fluorescent
intracellular carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester
(CFSE) cell labeling kit (Abcam) by following the manufacturer’s
protocol. At 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injection, specimens were harvested
and cross-sectioned (5 lm) with a freezing microtome
(CM1860; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Then, the specimens were
stained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) for 3 min and observed under
a fluorescence microscope (DM5500, Leica).
2.12. Disc height measurement
A molybdenum target radiographic image unit (GE Mammography
DMR Bucky 18  24, GE Healthcare, UK) was used to detect the
disc height of rats at 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after injection. The rats

were anesthetized and placed in the prone position and kept their
tails straight. A computed radiographic plate system (AGFA Diagnostic
Center Compact Plus, AGFA HealthCare, Belgium) was used
to manipulate the digital images. Disc height index (DHI%)
obtained from digitized radiographs using NIH software was used
to quantitatively describe disc height changes. All image assessments
were conducted by two independent, blinded observers.
2.13. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures and data
processing
T2-weighted sections in the sagittal plane obtained by a 3.0-T
MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems, UK) were used to reveal the
water content and the structure of the NP after 0, 4, 8, and 16
weeks of injection. The rats were anesthetized and placed in the
prone position with their tails straight. The parameter settings
were as follows: spin echo repetition time, 2275 ms; echo time,
80 ms; number of excitations, 8; field of view, 5 cm; slice thickness,
1.5 mm; and no phase wrap. Quantitative analysis of the
image slices was processed using a GE ADW4.2 workstation. The
alterations of the NP were evaluated by the MRI index (the area
of the NP multiplied by average signal intensity) proposed by Sobajima
et al [45]. Two researchers measured the disc height independently
in a blinded fashion.
2.14. Histological analysis
At 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after injection, specimens were harvested
by euthanizing the rats with intraperitoneal injection of
10% chloral hydrate. Specimens were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cross-sectioned (5
lm). Specimens were stained with safranin O–fast green (S-O) or
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The cellularity and morphology of
the IVD were evaluated using a grading scale (Table 2) by two

experienced histology researchers independently in a blinded fashion
as described previously [41].
2.15. Immunohistochemistry, sGAG, and hydroxyproline content
measurement
Specimens were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. After
that, the specimens were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min to inhibit
endogenous peroxidase and were blocked with goat serum for
30 min at room temperature. Then, the specimens were hybridized
with rabbit anti-rat type II collagen antibody (diluted at 1:100;
Abcam) at 4 C overnight. After washing with PBS for 5 min, the
specimens were incubated with goat anti-rabbit second antibody
conjugated with biotin for 1 h at room temperature and were
detected by the SABC method.
The contents of sGAG and hydroxyproline for each group were
detected using the DMMB assay and Hydroxyproline Assay Kit
(Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), respectively, and normalized
with dry weight. The experimental procedures were carried out
following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.16. Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD), and a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The statistical significance of the differences between experimental
groups was assessed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) following the Tukey post hoc test.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software package
(Version 22.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., USA). All experiments
were repeated at least three times using independent samples.
3. Results
3.1. The proper concentration of genipin
The LDH content reflected the cytotoxicity of genipin crosslinked
CCSA system on delivered cells. When the concentration
of genipin was more than 0.02%, the LDH release by ADSCs
increased significantly at each time point, especially on days 7
and 14 (Fig. 1A). In addition, the proliferation of ADSCs decreased
on days 7 and 14, when the concentration of genipin was more
than 0.02%. The concentrations 0.01% and 0.02% showed no significant
difference on cell proliferation on day 7; however, there was
a significant difference on day 14 (Fig. 1B). The microstructure of
noncross-linked CCS was porous, with a smooth and regular skeleton.
However, after genipin was added, the microstructure of the
hydrogel turned tough with twists and the pores became irregular
and indiscernible. As the concentration of genipin increased, the

X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 501
microstructure transformation of the hydrogel became increasingly
obvious (Fig. 1C–H). Therefore, we considered that the proper
concentration of genipin for cross-linking was 0.02%.
3.2. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of 0.02% genipin
cross-linked CCS or CCSA system
The genipin cross-linked CCSA delivery system formed a gel at
37C; the volume change upon gelation was not significant
(Fig. 2A). We used a rheometer to measure the gelation time of
the CCSA delivery system and found that the gelation time was
approximately 6 min and the G0 was approximately 5.91 Pa (Fig.
2B). The stability of the scaffolds was determined in vitro using
bacterial collagenase and chondroitinase ABC without disturbing
the cells. After cross-linking with 0.02% genipin, the stability of
CCS increased obviously (Fig. 2C). The type II collagen and CS remnants
of genipin cross-linked CCSs were approximately 26% and
40%, respectively, after 24 days, which were significantly higher
than that of noncross-linked scaffold (approximately 10% and
14%, respectively). The ADSC-laden CCS showed higher values of
G0 and G00 than those of blank CCS, but the difference was not significant.
When the CCSA delivery system was mixed, the value of
G00 (2.45 ± 0.16 Pa) was higher than G0 (1.30 ± 0.14 Pa). At 0.1 h,
the value of G00 (6.04 ± 0.20 Pa) turned nearly equal to G0 (6.14 ±
0.20 Pa). G0 remained higher than G00 after gelation for 1 h, and
the values were 2488.94 ± 45.67 and 231.03 ± 1.89 Pa, respectively,
at 48 h (Fig. 2D). As cross-linking time extended, the cross-linking
degree increased and the existence of ADSCs did not influence the
cross-linking degree. The values were, respectively, 37% ± 2% and
36% ± 2% (ADSCs laden and free) at 72 h (Fig. 2E). We also observed
the cellular morphology of ADSCs in the cell delivery system, and
the results showed that ADSC appeared to have a spherical shape,
distinctly different from the shape on monolayer culture (Fig. 2F).
3.3. In vitro study of the effects of CCSA delivery system on the laden
ADSCs
The gene and protein expression levels of aggrecan, SOX9, COL2,
and COL1 represent the matrix synthesis function of ADSCs. The
0.02% genipin cross-linked CCSA group showed higher gene
expression level of Acan than the other two groups on days 7 and
14 (Fig. 3A), which is similar to that of Sox9 (Figure 3B). The 0%
and 0.02% genipin group exhibited no significant difference in
Col2 expression on day 7, but there was a significant difference
on day 14 (Fig. 3C). All groups had no significant difference in
Col1 expression on day 7 or 14 (Fig. 3D). The protein expression
levels were similar to those of the relevant gene markers. The
0.02% genipin group showed significantly higher expression of
aggrecan than that of the control and 0% genipin groups. The 0%
and 0.02% genipin groups had similar expression levels of COL2
and SOX9 but were higher than those of the control group (Fig.
3E). Krt19 and Pax1 are specific gene markers of NP cells, while
Gdf10 specifically indicates the chondrogenic differentiation of
ADSCs [46,47]. The expression level of Krt19 in the 0.02% genipin
group was almost 3.29- and 4.87-fold higher than that of 0% genipin
and the control group, respectively, on day 14 (Fig. 3F). The
gene expression level of Pax1 in the 0.02% genipin group was
almost 4.99- and 11.62-fold higher than that of the control group
on days 7 and 14, respectively, and 2.44-fold higher than that of
the 0% genipin group on day 14 (Fig. 3G). There was no significant
difference between the three groups in the gene expression level of
Gdf10 (Fig. 3H).
3.4. Tracking injected ADSCs
CFSE-positive ADSCs could only be identified in the ADSC and
CCSA groups. The CFSE-positive ADSCs delivered by CCS remained
in clusters in the first week after injection, and the ADSCs delivered
Fig. 4. CFSE-positive ADSCs glowed green fluorescence in the NP at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injection. The fluorescence in the control, degeneration, CCS, ADSC, and CCSA
groups were detected. The nuclei of native and injected cells were stained blue. White arrows indicate CFSE-positive ADSCs. Scale bar = 100 mm.
502 X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509
without CCS appeared to have migrated and spread to the whole
NP. Two weeks after injection, some CFSE-positive ADSCs incorporated
in the CCS have also migrated to the distant sites. The CFSEpositive
ADSCs could be identified throughout the 4 weeks in culture
in both the ADSC and CCSA groups (Fig. 4).
3.5. Radiographic and MRI assessment of disc in different groups
As shown in Fig. 5, the DHI% in the degeneration, CCS, ADSC, and
CCSA groups were significantly lower than that in the control
group immediately after injection. Compared with the degenera-

tion and ADSC groups, the DHI% of the CCSA group was significantly
higher at weeks 4, 8, and 16. Moreover, the CCSA group
showed a higher DHI% than the CCS group at weeks 8 and 16. Interestingly,
there was no significant difference between the control
group and CCSA group at weeks 4 and 8, but there was a difference
at week 16 (100% ± 1% and 83% ± 2%, respectively). The MRI results,

which revealed the water content and structure of the NP, are
shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the control group, the other groups
had lower MRI indices at each time point. The degeneration group
had lower MRI index than that of the CCS, ADSC, and CCSA groups
at weeks 4, 8, and 16. Significant changes in the MRI index in the
CCSA group were observed at weeks 8 and 16 (2631.41 ± 159.76

and 2528.16 ± 201.01, respectively), compared with the CCS
(1751.53 ± 10.31 and 1064.39 ± 212.98, respectively) and ADSC
groups (1477.93 ± 36.87 and 934.21 ± 20.23, respectively). The T2
signal range was significantly decreased in the degeneration group
compared with the control group at week 16. Moreover, the T2 signal
range of the CCSA group was still inferior to that of the control
group but superior to those of the CCS and ADSC groups.
3.6. Histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of
the NP
The HE staining (Fig. 7A) showed that the normal NP was well
organized with cells and ECM. However, in the degeneration group,
the structure of the NP was destroyed and the lamellar sheets of AF
were disorganized. After 16 weeks of injection, the injured parts of
the NP in the degeneration, CCS, and ADSC groups were filled with
fibrous connective tissues, and the structure of the NP was indiscernible.
However, in the CCSA group, the cell and ECM distributions
were clear and more regular than those of the degeneration
group. A reduced matrix staining for proteoglycans was clearly
observed in the degeneration, CCS, and ADSC groups from the
images of S-O staining. The CCSA group demonstrated that the
degenerated NP was regenerated to some extent, with stronger
staining than the degeneration group (Fig. 7B).
The distribution of type II collagen was also detected at weeks 0
and 16. Type II collagen was only distinctly expressed in the control
and CCSA groups after 16 weeks of injection, and it was mainly
accumulated around cells. Few areas were immune positive for

group.
506 X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509
type II collagen in the CCS and ADSC groups, which indicated that
the normal structure of the NP did not exist (Fig. 8A). The contents
of sGAG at weeks 0 and 16 were measured by the DMMB assay and
were normalized to NP dry weight. The control group had higher
sGAG content than all the other groups at weeks 0 and 16. The
sGAG content of the CCSA group significantly increased compared
with that of the degeneration group at week 16. The CCSA group
also exhibited higher sGAG content than the CCS and ADSC groups.
We also quantified the content of type II collagen by measuring the
hydroxyproline content in the NP. The hydroxyproline content was
normalized to NP dry weight. The hydroxyproline content of the
control group was significantly higher than all the other groups
at weeks 0 and 16. Moreover, the CCSA group exhibited a significant
increase in hydroxyproline content compared with the degeneration
group as well as with the CCS and ADSC groups at week 16
(Fig. 8C).
We used the histological grading scale to comprehensively evaluate
the degeneration of discs. The normal NP showed regular
structure of the NP and AF, distributed with NP cells, and the water
content of the NP and disc height were normal. The histological
score of the control group was 5.2 ± 0.5. In the degeneration group,
the structure and composition of the NP was abnormal and the
degenerated sites were occupied by fibrocartilaginous tissue and
cells with different cellular morphology. The histological score of
the degeneration group was 12.8 ± 0.8, which was significantly
higher than that of the control group. The CCSA group had
increased disc height and water content when compared to those
of the degeneration group. In addition, the structure and ECM of
the NP were also partly recovered in the CCSA group at week 16.
Compared with the CCS and ADSC groups (9.8 ± 0.8 and 10.2 ±
1.3, respectively), the CCSA group had a significantly lower histological
score (7.4 ± 1.1), but it was still higher than the score of
the control group, which suggested that the discs in the CCSA
group still partly displayed the characteristics of degeneration
(Fig. 8D).
4. Discussion
A decrease in NP cells and a disruption of ECM occur during the
process of NP degeneration, which is responsible for IVD degeneration
and, consequently, lower back pain [48,49]. Stem cell transplantation
showed good results in increasing ECM, as the stem
cells can differentiate into an NP-like phenotype [50]. Although
several research groups have studied the fabrication of injectable
hydrogel with biological matrix, our study differs from other works
[28,51]. We chose type II collagen and CS, the two primary native
components in the NP as the main materials and combined them
according to the natural ratio of collagen and sGAG in the NP.
The CCS is preloaded with ADSCs and can be injected into the NP
with needle, followed by in situ gelation. Genipin is used as a
cross-linker to improve the bio-stability of the scaffold, with low
cytotoxicity. Moreover, we investigated the stimulatory effects of
our scaffold on ADSC differentiation in vitro and the regenerative
effect of CCSA delivery system on degenerated NP in vivo. The rat
tail disc degeneration model has been used in many studies
because of its greatly simplified procedure; hence, we chose the
rat tail discs to perform injections [52,53].
Although genipin is regarded as a less toxic cross-linker for
cells, high concentration is inadvisable when mixed directly
together with cells. The cross-linking degree of 0.02% genipin
was nearly 37%, and the type II collagen and CS remnants after
24 days of biodegradation were nearly 26% and 40%, respectively.
Higher concentrations of genipin can increase the cross-linking
degree and biostability of the scaffold [54], but they increase cytotoxicity
and change surface characteristics of the scaffold as well.
The function of ADSCs is more important in stem cell-based tissue
engineering; hence, we consider a concentration of 0.02% (the corresponding
concentration of EtOH is 0.075%, which is also safe to
ADSCs; Supplemental Fig. 1) to be optimal for the cross-linking
of the CCSA delivery system.
Cell shape and matrix stiffness influence the differentiation of
stem cells [55–57]. A spherical morphology associated with a dispersed
actin cytoskeleton with few focal adhesions stimulates the
chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in
addition to the osteogenic differentiation [58]. Moreover, several
studies have also reported that substrates with low stiffness are
more favorable for NP-like differentiation [22,59]. Our in vitro
study has demonstrated the CCS can induce the loaded ADSCs to
differentiate into an NP-like phenotype and increase ECM synthesis.
We consider that the stimulation effect of CCS is associated
with the low stiffness exhibited by CCS and the spherical shape
of ADSCs. The NP-like phenotype and chondrogenic phenotype
are difficult to distinguish, as both NP cells and chondrocytes
express high levels of Sox9, Acan, Col2, and their corresponding proteins
[47,60,61]. Krt19 and Pax1 are characteristic genes in NP cells,
which have the potential to characterize human NP cells [46,62].
Gdf10 is a novel chondrocyte marker that is expressed more than
100-fold in chondrocytes than in NP cells [46]. With the help of
these specific gene markers, we clarified the differentiation status
of ADSCs.
The results of CFSE-positive ADSCs delivered by CCS, which
remained in clusters 1 week after injection, demonstrated that
the scaffold turned into gel in situ and restrained the migration
of ADSCs. Over time, the biodegradation of CCS was enhanced,
and ADSCs migrated to other locations of the NP. The fluorescence
intensity and number of CFSE-positive ADSCs injected with CCS
decreased significantly at the 4th week after injection, but it did
not mean that the ADSCs had disappeared. CFSE-positive ADSCs
had the intracellular fluorescent label that was incorporated in a
stable form but decreased over time as a function of dilution with
cell division. The CCSA group showed significant regeneration after
16 weeks, which means the ADSCs were functional; we considered
that cell division was the reason for the decreased fluorescence
intensity and the decreased number of CFSE-positive ADSCs we
observed at week 4.
Our in vivo study results showed some characteristics of the
degenerated disc, such as a decrease in disc height; a decrease in
ECM, water content, and NP cells in the NP; and the abnormal
structure of the NP. CCS alone could increase disc height and NP
water content in a short time. We think this finding is due to the
CCS being a hydrogel, which has a high proportion of water. Moreover,
the CCS in the NP exhibited a G0 relatively higher than G00 ,
indicating the CCS presented in a more solid-like form and could
buffer the pressure on the disc [38]. However, the CCS did not
regenerate the degenerated NP essentially; hence, the disc height
and NP water content of the CCS group showed no significant difference
in the degeneration group after a long-term treatment
owing to the biodegradation of CCS. Degenerated NP had a suboptimal
environment (low oxygen tension, limited nutrition, acidic
pH, and high osmolarity), which showed a negatively influence
on the function or even survival of the transplanted cells [63–
65]. ADSCs injected without the scaffold showed no obvious regenerative
effect in the NP because ADSCs experienced the difficulty in
surviving and synthesizing matrix in a harsh environment [66].
Our CCS provides adherent sites for ADSCs and is likely to stimulate
the differentiation of ADSCs into an NP-like phenotype; hence, the
cells we injected survived, synthesized the matrix, and regenerated
the degenerated NP. The histological score is based on five categories
of degenerative changes and range from 5 points for a normal
disc to 15 points for a severely degenerated disc. The CCSA
group showed a decrease in histological score after 16 weeks,
X. Zhou et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 71 (2018) 496–509 507
which means that the degenerated NP was repaired to some
extent, displaying increased disc height, water content, proteoglycan
and type II collagen synthesis, and recovery of NP structure.
However, there is still a gap between the normal and regenerated
NP, as the histological score of the CCSA group was still higher than
that of the control group.
We used needle puncture to inject our CCSA delivery system
through the AF into the NP in this study. Several studies have
reported that the needle puncture in healthy IVDs could lead to a
loss of tissue functionality and disc pressure [67]. However, the
degenerated disc, on its own, causes matrix degradation and
reduced disc height [68,69]. The processes of delivering CCSA system
through injection is unlikely to aggravate the matrix loss but
will provide biological benefits to the degenerated NP. The limitations
of our CCSA delivery system in clinical application are the low
collagen content (3 mg/mL) in the hydrogel and low mechanical
property. Studies have demonstrated that NP acts as a cushion
with shock-absorbing properties [70,71]. The modulus of the
healthy NP is approximately 11 kPa [72], which is significantly
higher than that in our CCSA group. While stimulating NP-like differentiation
of ADSCs, the low collagen density of our CCSA delivery
system loses mechanical support and it is difficult to stabilize
a degenerated disc. More research should be carried out to improve
the inducing efficiency of NP-like differentiation and the mechanical
property of our CCSA delivery system together.
5. Conclusion
In this study, we fabricated a novel scaffold with type II collagen
and CS to deliver ADSCs through needle injection. The CCS we fabricated
is cross-linked with 0.02% genipin and has the ability of
in situ gelation after injection. Although the cross-linking degree
is low, the CCS showed an increased bio-stability and solid-like
properties after gelation. Our in vitro results demonstrated the
bio-safety of the CCS on ADSCs and the stimulation effects of the
scaffold on the differentiation of ADSCs. We further studied the
regenerative effects of the CCSA delivery system on the degenerated
NP in an animal model, and we demonstrated that the CCSA
delivery system could partly regenerate the degenerated NP. We
hope our study can provide new insights into the clinical application
of stem cell-based tissue engineering for the treatment of IVD
degeneration.
