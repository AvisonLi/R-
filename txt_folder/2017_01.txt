In parallel with worldwide population growth, Europe is experiencing a fast demographic shift widely studied
but generally undervalued by policymakers. Population aging may imply smaller household sizes and more
home-based energy consumption, which will change the energy mix. Consumer preference shifts and different
attitudes towards environment among the generations determine additional effects. Study of the link between
an aging population and energy demand is even more important for Italy because its energy dependence is
almost complete and its population is aging quickly. This paper aims to assess the role of changing generational
preferences in the energy expenditure trend in Italy by distinguishing between a pure age effect and a cohort
effect. The decomposition shows significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, thus confirming
that, beside an aging effect, we must consider that recent generations have a higher residential energy expenditure.
Indeed, the energy culture of post war Italian generations seems more linked to thermal comfort (heating
and air conditioning) than to environmental attitudes.

1. Introduction
Population aging is a long-term trend which began several decades
ago in Europe. The growth in the relative share of older people may
be explained, among other things, by a rise in life expectancy, and
specifically by an increase in life expectancy in good health. The
share of elderly people in the total population will significantly
increase in the near future as the post-war baby-boom generation
reaches retirement. This trend is particularly marked in Italy, where
the proportion of the population aged 65 and over (21% in 2014) is
the highest among European countries and it is projected to rise further
by 2050.
The economic effects of an aging population have been extensively
studied and following the pioneering contributions by Ramsey and
Modigliani, life-cycle theory shows that aggregate consumption and
savings are affected by the age structure of the population. In other
words, the distribution of age groups among the population matters
because households adapt consumption behaviour to the needs of
different life-cycle phases.
Only recently has attention been devoted to the energy-related
behaviour of different age groups: this is probably connected to awareness
of climate change as the related literature agrees on the fact that an
aging population may hinder public policy efforts to reduce energy
intensity and greenhouse gas emissions.1 This alarm is linked to the
fact that as a result of a less active lifestyle elderly people have a higher
energy demand for heating and electricity.
However, the picture is more complex than expected, and several
factors – such as aggregate income trends, consumer preferences and
societal transformation – may play roles with contradictory effects. Setting
aside the macroeconomic aggregate results of these counteracting
forces, in this paper we stress the microeconomic perspective by
looking at household heterogeneity in terms of age and generation.
We use data drawn from the Italian Household Budget Survey to perform
a pooled regression analysis and a study of cohort groups with
the aim of disentangling age and cohort effects. The pooled analysis
confirms the main findings in the international literature highlighting
that dwelling and personal characteristics – among which age – are
key factors explaining household residential energy demand. We then
analyse how relevant the interplay between age and cohort effects is
by applying the decomposition between cohort, age and year effects
presented by Deaton and Paxson (1994). Empirical evidence reveals
significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, showing
that expenditure rises with age, yet this pure age effect interplays
with cultural factors which differ across generations. Similarities in
social experiences and cultural influences shape energy consumption

patterns across generations so that there are smaller differences in electricity
expenditure among generations than in heating expenditure.
The paper is organized as follows. After a survey of the literature on
the linkages between aging and energy consumption (Section 2),
Section 3 briefly discusses the residential energy intensity of Italian
households. Section 4 describes the dataset and in Section 5 the results
of a pooled regression analysis are discussed. The cohort analysis is
introduced in Section 6 and the results of the decomposition of age,
period and cohort effects are presented. The final section contains our
conclusions.
2. Residential energy demand and an aging population: a survey of
the related literature
Most of the international economics literature analysing residential
energy consumption agrees on the fact that household energy
demand is a combination of non-human (such as dwelling and weather
conditions) and human characteristics, the latter including demographic,
psychological and cultural elements.
Weather conditions and meteorological temperature levels are
widely used as control variables in household energy demand models.
Indeed, a growing literature estimating the elasticity of energy demand
to temperature variation has been trying to assess the global warming
impact on heating and cooling expenditure.2 As expected, there is a
negative link between temperature levels and heating-related energy
demand, whereas a positive link is evident for cooling-related expenditure.
However, there are non-linearities in this kind of relation due to
both threshold effects and cultural components.
By using Dutch micro data, Brounen et al. (2012) find that the
characteristics of the dwelling are more relevant for gas and heating
consumption whereas electricity consumption is more affected by
demographic characteristics. Moreover, they find that electricity is
more sensitive to income fluctuations than gas consumption. They
also document a strong relationship between the age and characteristics
of dwellings (with detached houses using more energy) and their
resource consumption. According to their estimates, recently built
dwellings use about 65% less gas for heating than those constructed
prior toWorld War II, due to improvements in construction technology
and insulation, and this is especially true for those dwellings built after
the oil shock. On the contrary, they find greater electricity consumption
in post-war buildings and especially in those of recent construction.
Costas and Kahn (2011) estimate a link between electricity consumption
per dwelling and the electricity price at the time the building was
built, because low electricity prices at the time of construction reduce
the incentive to install energy efficient devices. Therefore, consumers
exhibit a time preference bias because they seem unable to take into
consideration price changes.
Turning to socio-economic characteristics, several studies highlight
the relevance of economies of scale with regard to residential energy
use, so that household size is a key variable. Economies of scale mean
that small households use more energy per capita to maintain a certain
level of energy-related services (heating, hot water, cooking facilities).
Ironmonger et al. (1995) estimate significant economies of scale in
Australian household energy use and expenditure on energy, with
small differences among household types but clear evidence of diseconomies
of scale for older households. This penalization of elderly households
is linked to lower income levels and to smaller household size.
Householdswith higher levels of education tend to adoptmore environmentally
friendly behaviours (Torgler et al., 2008) and are perhaps
more willing to reduce their carbon footprints. From another point of
view, such individuals are more likely to fully consider energy saving
cost reduction or to take advantage of energy saving tax incentives, so
they aremore likely to insulate their homes or install energy production
devices such as solar panels. Longhi (2015) finds that in the UK those
households where at least one member has a university degree spend
on average about 2% per capita less on energy overall, but the impact
is lower if pro-environmental attitudes are considered. This suggests
that peoplewith higher education levelsmay bemore aware of environmental
problems andmorewilling to adopt pro-environmental types of
behaviour, even after controlling for household income. Income level
per se is important, but less relevant to predicting consumption heterogeneity
than expected. Income elasticity estimates vary widely among
studies, with a tendency to be smaller when using microdata sets. As
a general finding, elasticities are higher for heating-related than electricity
expenditures. Similarly, changes in household socio-economic
circumstances (such as entering unemployment) translate into changes
in energy consumption, but their impact is small compared to that of
dwelling characteristics (on gas expenditure) and especially household
size (Longhi, 2015).3
Homeownership is also important because it influences the propensity
to invest in energy saving. However as Meier and Rehdanz (2010)
and Longhi (2015) document, UK homeowners seem to have a higher
energy expenditure (7% more than households in rented houses,
according to Longhi, 2015), notwithstanding this greater propensity to
invest in energy-saving measures.
What about the interaction between household age structures –
or more generally population aging – and these drivers of energy
consumption? As a general finding, household energy consumption
tends to change over the lifespan and an inverted U shape can be
observedwhen considering household energy expenditure and average
family age or householder age. This is due to a changing size and composition
of the household, so that when the householder's age is between
40 and 60 there is the highest probability of there being overlapping
generations in the house.
In particular, aging is usually associatedwith higher energy expenditure
and GHG emissions: older households spend more on energy,
especially on heating, because they occupy houses for a larger proportion
of the day and they usually need more heating comfort. Aging can
also have indirect impacts through an associated decline in household
size and consequently a loss of economies of scale in energy use at the
household level. The decrease in average household size is not a particular
feature of aged people but can be considered a general pattern of
modern society observable in almost all industrialized countries,
among which Italy. Using a panel of Japanese households, Schröder
et al. (2015) estimate that a 5% decline in average household size during
the period 2005–10 resulted in forgone household economies of scale
equivalent to a 3.5% increase in household-sector energy demand. This
trend of declining household size therefore resolves in an upward pressure
on total residential energy use that can be only partially offset by
enhancing the efficiency of the home and its appliances. Moreover,
older households generally have lower income levels and this acts as a
factor mitigating energy demand, but at the same time acts to further
lower energy saving investment.
What can consumer culture, which can be particular to different
cohorts, add to this general analysis of physical and demographic
characteristics? It is widely known that the traditional neo-classical
assumptions of cost minimization provide a somewhat poor model for
interpreting actual energy-related choices. Energy consumption patterns
vary greatly between apparently similar types of household, either
when looking at cross-sectional data, or when considering different
cohorts. This heterogeneity goes beyond bias and errors in evaluating
costs and price signals,4 and can be better described by looking at
characteristics of energy culture. According to Stephenson et al.
(2010), energy choices can be understood by looking at the interactions

3 On this point, see Espey and Espey (2004).
4 The behavioural literature widely discusses the reasons for non-optimized energy demand
behaviour, and especially regarding energy saving investment. On this topic, see
Maréchal (2010).

between “cognitive norms, (e.g. beliefs, understandings),material culture
(e.g. technologies, building form) and energy practices (e.g. activities,
processes).”5 Energy culture standards are not immutable. On the
contrary, new standards can be rapidly adopted and they can be shaped
by prevalent behaviours in society as well as by technology availability.
With better health and greater wealth than their parents' generation,
newly retired people may be able to fulfil ambitions of leisure activities
and travel. These newolder cohorts are likely to be in a position to access
goods associated with comfort and leisure, among which electronic
equipment and digital connectivity (including social networking) play
a key role. A recent survey in the UK reveals that the spending share
on leisure goods is relatively similar across age groups, whereas for
leisure services to be used outside the home only the oldest pensioners
(aged over 80) spend notably less (Hamza and Gilroy, 2011). Carlsson-
Kanyama et al. (2005) conclude that generationsmatterwhen residential
energy consumption is considered. They find “differences in housing
standards, consumption and environmental behaviour between generations
born during the 1940s compared to those born in the 1950s,
1960s and later….”6 and they link this effect to the different stages of
development of the Swedish economy, which after the War World II
period of shortage of goods entered the ‘consumer society’ in the sixties.
It can be said that generations are characterized by common consumer
experiences,which in turn define future consumption patterns.
The links between the main human/non-human characteristics and
residential energy demand are summarized in the first column of Fig. 1.

3. Italian residential energy intensity: the end of
energy-saving primacy?
Despite Italy having one of the lowest levels of energy intensity, both
at the GDP and household consumption levels, progress has slowed down
and at the moment the energy efficiency targets set at the EU level seem
beyond any concrete possibility. The structural low level of energy intensity
can be attributed to a number of factors, including the mild Mediterranean
climate, the structure of economic activities and the traditional
high energy dependency, which in turn causes high energy prices.7 The
already-good energy efficiency of Italian households further improved
by 10% over the period 2000–2012, compared to the EU average of 19%.
This relatively slow progress was mainly linked to a mix of further increases
in energy prices and public incentives to promote energy-saving
maintenance for buildings and fixtures. Regarding electricity use, Italian
families increased their consumption by 2.2% over the same timespan,
whereas at the EU level only a 1.3% increasewas recorded. This difference
is due to lower energy-saving results for Italy. Looking at space heating,
the EU and Italy exhibit opposite trends. On average, EU citizens reduced
the amount of energy used for space heating thanks to more energy efficiency
and a change in their heating attitudes. Italy, on the contrary,
showed an increase in energy consumption connected to an increase in
the number of dwellings and to a change in heating behaviour that energy
saving and the milder climate could not compensate for (Fig. 2).
4. The data
In order to understand the relative importance of energy demand
drivers, we use data on household expenditure collected through the
Household Budget Survey (IHBS) published by the Italian Statistical
Office (ISTAT). Altogether, some 22,000 households are sampled throughout
the year to represent the Italian population at the regional level.
Beside sociodemographic characteristics, the survey collects information
about expenditure on household goods and services.8 Our analysis uses
observations for the period 1997–2013, and therefore includes the years
of economic downturn after 2007. The survey is designed as a repeated
cross section so it is not possible to look at the behaviour of the same
individuals over time, but different ages in different groups of households
can be observed. A cross-sectional analysis of energy expenditure is
useful to provide an idea of how households with different characteristics
compare, but it is difficult to disentangle structural heterogeneity and
behavioural differences or changes.
The dataset contains data on energy expenditure, dwelling characteristics
and sociodemographic factors formore than 20,000 households
each year.Households are grouped according to the head's year of birth9
using five-year age classes.10 As we are interested in distinguishing
energy demand by age, Table 1 reports data on weighted frequencies
and on household size by age class at the beginning and end of the
period observed. The table highlights how profoundly demographic
trends are shaping the population structure in Italy: the share of
households with the householder aged 65 or over was 30.7% in 1997
and became 35.5% in 2013 (18.8% for those aged 75 or over). At the
same time, we can also observe a sharp increase in household numbers
(more than 4 million) and a decrease in the average family size (from
2.7 in 1997 to 2.3 in 2013).
As is generally agreed, a smaller household size means a loss of
economies of scale and greater vulnerability to fuel poverty. Table 2
shows a clear increase in the share of residential energy expenditure
in total consumption expenditure, from an average of 5.7% in 1997 to
6.3% in 2013. This share increases linearly with age class, confirming
the hypothesis that elderly people need more thermal comfort and
spend more on heating. As Faiella and Lavecchia (2015) discuss, an
energy share level above 6% represents a historical peak and it is the
result of two factors: a greater increase in energy price indexes with
respect to the overall consumption price index and the effect of the
financial crisis on average income and total expenditure.11 During
the period observed, both overall per capita heating and electricity

9 The household head is the reference person as indicated in the civil registry. Householders
under 18 have been excluded from our dataset.
10 The microdata released only report the age of household members as a continuous
variable for the years 1997–2001. Since 2002, ISTAT has adopted a new methodology to
protect the privacy of the individuals surveyed. Therefore, for the years 2002–2013 the
age variable is aggregated into 15 classes (0–5; 6–14; 15–17, 18–24; 25–29; 30–34; 35–
39; 40–44; 45–49; 50–54; 55–59; 60–64; 65–69; 70–74; and 75 and over).
11 Although themeasurement of fuel poverty is a key research issuewith several indicators
being used in the literature (see Faiella and Lavecchia, 2015), in Table 2 a very rough
measure is shown. A household is considered ‘fuel poor’ if the family spends more than
10% of its total expenditure on fuel.
164 R. Bardazzi, M.G. Pazienza / Energy Economics 65 (2017) 161–171
consumption exhibit an increase. However, while the rise in per capita
electricity intensity appears unquestionable, the data for heating show
a sharp growth in nominal expenditure but the change in real expenditure
is much more limited. Indeed, two counteracting forces operated
in the period considered: increasing gas prices and milder weather
conditions, which also vary greatly over years and geographical areas
in Italy.
It is worth stressing that the economic crisis seems to have hit
households with the householder aged 65 or over less severely, probably
because they can count on pension transfers and accumulated
wealth. Indeed, Table 2 shows that between 1997 and 2013 the incidence
of householders aged 60 and over spending more than 10% of
their total expenditure on energy increased less than the average. However,
there are some hints of a change in older householder consumption
attitudes. As those who grew up during the world wars (and thus
were influenced by a precautionary saving attitude) are progressively
becoming fewer and those in good health more numerous, elderly
Italian people are starting to collect leisure-related electronic devices
and also to improve their living standards by means of air conditioning
equipment (Table 3). It is evident that all the households belonging to
the last three age classes were particularly active in adjusting to new
consumer standards in the period observed.
This switch in the consumer culture of the elderly in Italy can also be
confirmed for house-related investment, among which energy saving
expenditure plays an important role. The empirical literature generally
stresses that investment aimed at increasing energy efficiency is more
common among younger generations and among households moving
into new houses (see Ramos et al., 2016 for the Spanish case). Table 3,
on the contrary, shows that the share of elderly Italian householders
(those aged 65 or over) investing in property renovation – especially
window fixture renovation – and solar panels is comparable to the overall
average.12 This kind of expenditure – which is also a confirmation
that an important share of elderly householders were less liquidityconstrained
during the financial crisis – indicates a growing environmental
awareness and greater importance assigned to environmental
protection among elderly householders in Italy, as has recently been
shown by several surveys.13
5. Determinants of residential energy expenditure
In order to understand the joint effect of social and dwelling characteristicswe
first run a set of pooled regressions, trying to disentangle the
main drivers of energy demand by considering as dependent variable
the total energy expenditure or its main components, i.e. expenditure
on electricity and residential heating.
Briefly, the basic equation to be estimated is
Ln Eeqit ð Þ¼α0 þ βXit þ γYit þ uit ; ð1Þ
where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the household's
deflated equivalent residential energy expenditure14 (either overall
or on electricity or on heating), Xit is the set of non-human characteristics
(such as weather and dwelling size) and Yit is the set of sociodemographic
factors (or human characteristics).
Table 4 describes the variables employed in the equations. The
dependent variables are grouped at the top of the list.

12 The only age class exhibiting a very high propensity to invest in solar panels is the
youngest. This may be due to a more environmentally friendly attitude or to a greater
familiarity with new technology.
13 The Eurobarometer detailed database reports data on the attitude towards the environment
by age classes for all EU countries. See European Commission (2014) for a general
overview.
14 Nominal variables have been converted to real values using commodity-specific price
indexes (base year 2010). Moreover, in order tomake household expenditure comparable
with different demographic compositions we use an equivalence scale which divides
household income by the square root of household size. The square root scale, adopted
in recent OECD works (OECD, 2013), implies that a household of four persons has needs
twice as large as one composed of a single person.We use an age-neutral equivalence scale
becausewewant to highlight the age effect in the regression. However, alternative equivalence
scales have been tested and the empirical results of our analysis have proven to be
robust to all alternatives.

Table 5 presents the regression results15 for the whole period
(1997–2013). As a general outcome, we can observe that the main
findings of the international empirical literature are also confirmed for
Italian households. The first column of Table 5 presents the regression
resultswhen household equivalent total residential energy expenditure
is the dependent variable. Regarding socio-demographic drivers, a
positive link between age and energy expenditure is confirmed, as is
the fact that women need more thermal comfort, so woman householders
are associated with higher energy expenditure.More in details,
the effect of the different age classes on regression has been shown
through age dummies, so highlighting that the effect is nonlinear.16
The total household consumption level – as a proxy for household
income level – has a clear and positive link with energy consumption.
The regression results also confirm that high education levels are associated
with lower consumption,17 whereas employment status appears
not to be relevant in this case. Household equivalent energy expenditure
is higher the greater the dwelling size and the lower the household
size, thus confirming the importance of economies of scale. Due to the
different atmospheric temperature level, overall energy expenditure is
higher in the north and in the centre of Italy, whereas air conditioning
has a positive effect because of the electricity component in overall
energy expenditure. Dwelling age has a positive coefficient because of
the greater square footage of older buildings and less powerful energy
saving technologies embedded in historical dwellings; however, a
significant coefficient can only be found for more recent buildings.
Dwelling types and heating types exhibit a clear influence on energy
expenditure: detached houses and independent heating systems are
linked to higher energy expenditure.18 Not surprisingly, non-ordinary
maintenance expenditure exhibits a negative sign, an indication that
recent non-ordinary dwelling-related investments are linked to energy
saving goals. In contrast with other international estimations, residential
energy expenditure is higher if the householder is also the owner of the
dwelling,19 probably an indication of a positive wealth effect.

15 In the OLS pooled estimations shown in Table 5, errors are clustered by year.
16 Householders belonging to age class “40–44” have been chosen as reference group so
this class has been excluded from estimation.
17 A positive influence of education level on energy saving behaviour has been widely
found in the literature. However, Mills and Schleich (2012) find that this impact varies
greatly among countries.
18 Unlike other countries, in Italy central heating – here defined as a unique heating system
for all the flats composing the same building - is not the norm: more than 70% of
dwelling have an independent (i.e. single family) heating system. See Brounen et al.
(2012) for the Danish case.
19 Of the 22million households in Italy on census in 2011, about 80% were owner occupied
and the residual 20% were rented. The share of owner occupied households is higher
in Italy with respect to other EU countries due to a higher household saving rate and to a
greater propensity towards home ownership.

The equivalent electricity expenditure estimation has similar results
in terms of coefficient size and magnitude (Table 5, second column).
However, some interesting differences can be found: the geographical
location dummies show an opposite effect because household electricity
needs are greatly affected by cooling and air conditioning so
that households located in the north and in the centre have lower electricity
expenditure levels. The householder age variables also exhibit a
clear nonlinear path. Coefficients are increasing with age, but at declining
rate after the age of 60, probably a sign that electricity consumption
needs are more similar across age profiles than in studies covering previous
decades, as found by Hamza and Gilroy (2011). On the contrary,
dwelling age does not influence electricity expenditure. As heating
is the main component of residential energy costs, the estimated
coefficients for heating expenditure are very similar to those for overall
energy expenditure, as is shown by the third column in Table 5.
6. Energy consumption profiles: the life cycle and generations
The empirical analysis presented in the previous section has the aim
of investigating consumer choices at specific ages for different groups of
households. Consumption behaviour at different ages for the same
cohort cannot be analysed because in repeated cross-sections families
are not followed over time as in panel data. To obtain this research perspective,
birth cohorts must become the unit of analysis: generations
encounter different historical and social conditions as they age and
therefore it is reasonable for themto have diverse behavioural attitudes.
Cohort analysis is crucial for inference about age-period-cohort (APC)
effects. Age effects represent aging-related changes in behaviour and
are common to many issues, including consumption choices. Cohort
effects reflect similarities in experiences and social influences across a
particular generation that affect itsmembers' choices. Finally, all cohorts
may be affected by macro shocks, period effects that synchronously but
temporarily move all cohorts away from their profiles.
A first insight into the interaction between these effects is given in
Fig. 3, which shows the cross-sectional age profiles of (constant-price)
energy consumption for selected years. Each curve plots the average
residential energy expenditure of all households with heads of the
same age against the head's age.20
If we look at average consumption levels by age, we observe
that each curve is hump-shaped, rising from the age of 25 to 50
and declining thereafter. Therefore, these survey data confirm a
standard finding in the literature (see Meier and Rehdanz, 2010
for the British case): household residential energy expenditures
show a peak when the household head is about 50 years old and
the family has reached its largest size, and then it decreases as
the youngsters move out and the household's members become
older. If we compare these curves across time, we observe that
real consumption growth raised these profiles from 2002 to
2006. Later, the economic crisis resulted in a fall in household energy
expenditure, so the 2008 consumption profile is below that of
2002. After an increase in energy expenditure in 2010, the 2013
cross-sectional profile is well below the profiles for all previous
years. As previously mentioned, this figure also shows that the effect
of the crisis is less noticeable for families with older household heads
as the average energy expenditures for all the years for this group are
closer to each other.
The main point here is to distinguish between a pure age effect
and a cohort effect on energy expenditure. The cohort effects prohibit
a cross-sectional consumption profile frombeing considered a lifecycle
age-related profile. In fact, consumption behaviour includes an
age effect, which is the characteristic life-cycle profile of the variable,
and a cohort effect that leads to differences in the position of age profiles
for different cohorts. If these differences exist, it is not correct to
extrapolate from cross-sectional data information about the lifecycle
consumption of an individual household. Although economic
analysis based on survey data has its advantages because of the
wide variety of household characteristics in the sample, it has limits
too because we are not looking across ages at the same cohort of
households, but at the experience at different ages of different generations.
However, with a time series of cross sections, it is still possible
to follow cohorts of families from one survey to another.
Tracking different cohorts through successive surveys allows us to
disentangle the generational from the life-cycle components in consumption
profiles. In order to do this, we need to construct cohort
data or pseudo-panel data. These semi-aggregated data provide a
link between the microeconomic household-level data and the macroeconomic
data from national accounts. Then it is possible to use
these cohort data to apply a decomposition into age, cohort, and
year effects. This technique is commonly used to test the life-cycle
Fig. 3. Cross-sectional household energy expenditure profiles.
20 The stepwise shape of the curves is because the consumption profiles are presented
according to age classes.

theory of consumption.21 Here, we use this decomposition as a device
to verify our hypothesis of an age and a cohort effect overlapping
in energy-related consumption behaviour.
6.1. Building cohort data
The use of pseudo-panel data was introduced by Deaton (1985),
who suggested forming cohort-level data if repeated cross sections are
available. A cohort is defined as “a group with fixed membership,
individuals of which can be identified as they show up in the surveys”
(Deaton 1985, p. 109). The main assumption behind the construction
of a pseudo-panel is that units sharing the same time-invariant
characteristics – and therefore allocated to the same cohort – have
similar behaviour and can consequently be treated as a single unit. An
additional hypothesis is that the cohort population is assumed to be
constant.22 Therefore, the possibility that migration, aging and death
can change its composition over time is excluded. However, more
serious difficulties come when the data are only collected at the household
level and we define cohorts of households by the age of the head.
This choice creates problems because households are not permanent;
they change with divorces, remarriages and older people going to live
with their children. Therefore, old households in some surveys may
become young households in others (Deaton, 1997). Although in
pseudo-panels microeconomic heterogeneity is reduced, they have
some advantages over genuine panels. First, the wide availability of
cross-sectional data allows researchers to build pseudo-panels covering
substantially longer periods than those that can be covered by real
panels. Moreover, pseudo-panels are also substantially larger in the
number of units that they cover. Finally, pseudo-panel data tend to
deal with the attrition problem which is suffered by genuine panels. In
cohort data, the exit and entry of new units is allowed while the nature
of the panel data over time is maintained.
The definition of cohorts creates a trade-off between the number of
observations per cohort and the number of cohorts. Indeed, if the first
dimension is favoured over the second, there is a risk of grouping individuals
with heterogeneous behaviour in the same cohort. Conversely, if
a large number of cohorts is designed to preserve variability within the
panel, there is the risk of obtaining a very low number of observations
for each cohort, thus leading to inconsistent estimates (Nijman and
Verbeek, 1992; Verbeek, 2008). In this paper, the cohorts are built
by the date of birth of the household head, or more conveniently by his/
her age in 1997, which is the first year of our dataset. As shown below,
the number of cohorts and the cell sizes are chosen to guarantee that sample
cohort averages are reliable estimates of the population cohortmeans.
As previously explained, our data come from seventeen independent
cross sections of the Italian Household Budget Survey conducted by
ISTAT for the period 1997–2013. The key variables of interest are household
equivalent real expenditure on electricity and heating, calculated
following the preliminary operations previously discussed for pooled
regressions. In addition, extreme and unreliable values are cleaned
from the dataset through a trimming procedure that excludes observations
falling outside the first and last percentiles.
To construct the pseudo-panel for our analysis, we only keep households
in which the head is 25–81 years old. This truncation eliminates
those below 25, because there were very few household heads so
young, and those above 81 to avoid a selectivity problem. For each survey,
we average the expenditure by the age of the head and then track
the sample from the same cohort one year older in the next survey.23
For example, we look at the average expenditure of 30-year-olds in
the 1997 survey, of 31-year-olds in the 1998 survey and so on. We
build and use cohorts at each age and therefore we end up with 73
cohorts: the youngest of these is 25 years old in 2013; the oldest is
65 years old in 1997. For each commodity we have a stacked vector
of cohort-year observations of mean cohort expenditure.24 Table 6
describes the cohorts and gives the cell size and average energy consumption
in 1997 for a selection of cohorts (every fifth cohort for the
sake of simplicity). The table reveals that the cell size in the first year
of our data is lower for the youngest and the oldest cohorts. The explanation
for the youngest cohort is simply that 25-year-olds are less likely
to be household heads than older people. Obviously, the cell size for this
cohort increases up to 2013 because the group of 41-year-old household
heads is more numerous. For the last cohort, mortality is the cause of
the cell size decrease. For the middle years of household headship, the
variation in sample size is limited, both because there are more households
and because the selection problems are less severe.
We show the energy expenditures of the cohorts in Fig. 4. The first
line segment – labelled ‘1’ – connects the average consumption
of those who are 25 years old in 1997 to the average consumption of
26-year-olds in 1998, until the last observation of the cohort in 2013,
when the householders are 41 years old. The following line segments
repeat the exercise for those who are five years older, up to the last
cohort considered in this graph – those born in 1932, labelled ‘9’.
In this graph, a visible life-cycle pattern can be observed, rising with
age and then falling after a peak around the age of 50.With few exceptions
at older ages, the lines for the younger cohorts are very often but
not always above the lines for the older cohorts, even when they are
observed at the same age, i.e. when the cohorts overlap. This is the
cohort effect.
However,we also observe a great deal ofwithin-cohort movements.
Some of these may be explained by a common macroeconomic shock,
which is perhaps the hardest to see in this graph. Note that each connected
line segment corresponds to the same contemporaneous span
of 17 years, 1997–2013. Each cohort shows a slowdown in the early
2000s, then a double-dip fall in 2007 and 2010 corresponding to the
economic crisis and to the sovereign-debt European crisis. This is an
example of year effect, i.e. an aggregate effect that synchronously but
temporarily moves all the cohorts away from their profiles, in this
case a fall in the economic growth rate. A deeper analysis of this figure
requires us to distinguish three effects: age, cohort, and year effects. In
order to do this, we apply a decomposition procedure to separate the
three components.
6.2. Age, cohort and year effects: a decomposition
In order to estimate the decomposition of effects,we can regress the
cohort consumption averages against dummy variables for all three sets
21 See Deaton and Paxson (1994), Jappelli (1999) and Jappelli andModigliani (1998). For
a previous application on Italian household consumption items see Bardazzi (2001).
22 “An assumption that is needed if the successive surveys are to generate randomsamples
from the same underlying population.” Deaton (1997), p.121.
23 For the years 2002–2013 the age variable is aggregated in classes. To construct cohorts
with previous years' data where exact age is available, we assume that individuals of all
ages within each class have the average consumption level of that class. 24 In fact, we work with the means of the logarithm of expenditure.

of effects. Obviously, other restrictions could be used such as polynomials,
but with plentiful data we can use dummy variables and thus
allow the data to choose any pattern. The model can be written as
y ¼ β þ Aα þ Cγ þ Yψ þ u; ð2Þ
where y is the stacked vector of observations, A is a matrix of age
dummies, C a matrix of cohort dummies, and Y a matrix of year
dummies.25
We must drop one column from each of the three matrices of
dummies to avoid singularity. However, it is still impossible to estimate
this regression because of an additional linear relationship across age,
cohort and year. That is, if we decide to label cohorts c as the age of
the household head in year t = 0 and t refers to the date, we can infer
the cohort's age a as
a ¼ c þ t ð3Þ
Therefore, it is necessary to impose another restriction to obtain the
normalisation effects. There are several possible alternatives and each of
them implies different results. This identification problem is wellknown
in the literature and alternative normalisation methods have
been proposed (among others, by McKenzie, 2006; Schulhofer-Wohl,
2013; Yang et al., 2008). All these approaches have their shortcomings
and their increased generality comes at the cost of increased technical
complexity.
One of themost common normalisations imposes the constraint that
year dummy coefficients are orthogonal to a time-trend and sumto zero
(Deaton and Paxson, 1994). To understand this approach, we can consider
an example of a variable, say consumption, growing at 5% for
each year for each cohort. This growth can be represented by a time
trend of 5% a year in the year effects,without either cohort or age effects,
or by age effects that rise linearly with age added to cohort effects that
fall linearly with age. Note that these two effects are equal (5%) but of
opposite sign because the cohorts are labelled by age at a fixed date,
so that the older cohorts (larger c) are poorer, not richer. In our case,
where energy consumption is the variable to be decomposed, it seems
reasonable to attribute all the trends observable in the data to age and
cohort effects, not time, and to use the year effects to capture cyclical
fluctuations that average to zero over the long run. The simplest way
to implement this normalisation is to estimate the model with the
first age group, and the seventeenth cohort omitted, so that the reference
group is that of a household headed by a 25-year-old in 1997.
The year dummies are constrained to be orthogonal to a time trend
and to add up to zero.26
6.3. Empirical results
We apply this decomposition to the energy expenditure of the
households grouped into two categories: electricity and heating fuels.
The results of the decomposition of age and cohort effects are presented
in Figs. 5 and 6; the estimated parameters and the statistics of themodel
are shown in the Appendix.
For these energy expenditure items, two graphswith four panels are
presented. The first plot shows the average of logged consumption for
every fifth cohort. The other three panels show the age effects, the
cohort effects (plotted as a function of the age of the household head
in 1997), and the year effects respectively. All the effects are jointly
statistically significant, with F-values in the case of electricity for age
and cohort effects of 46.07 and 39.7 respectively, while the statistic is
112.78 for the period effects. In Fig. 5, equivalent electricity expenditure
rises with age, with a peak around the age of 55 and then flattening out
at older ages. This life-cycle pattern is confirmed by the age effect,
where the parameter rises from zero to 0.4 between ages 25 and 50
and then increases to 0.65 at age 80. The cohort effects (bottom lefthand
panel) are of about the same magnitude as the age effects, and
they steadily decline from younger to older generations. Indeed,
electricity consumption increases at about 1.2% per cohort so that, for
example, the expenditure at age 50 of someone born in 1963 is on
average 20% higher than the expenditure at the same age of someone
born in 1947. The year effects (bottom right-hand panel) appear
multi-peaked and seem to reproduce the economic cycle.
25 In our case, all thematrices havemrows,which is the number of cohort-year pairs for
each commodity. The number of columns is 57 (the number of ages) formatrix A, 73 (the
number of cohorts) for C, and 17 (the number of years) for Y.
26 Consider dt as the usual zero-one dummy. To enforce this restriction, we use a set of
T-2 year dummies, dt *, defined as follows, from t = 3,… T
dt ¼ dt−½t−1d2−t−2d1
Fig. 4. Energy expenditure by cohort.
R. Bardazzi, M.G. Pazienza / Energy Economics 65 (2017) 161–171 169
Similar conclusions can be drawn for heating fuel expenditure (Fig. 6). In
this case too, the age, cohort and period effects are significant.27
Equivalent heating expenditure shows a steadily increasing age effect,
and the effect is steeper before the age of forty. The magnitude of age
effects is larger than in the case of electricity, with an average increase
of 1.8% per year. As regards cohort effects, younger generations clearly
have increased heating expenditure and this is particularly true for the
cohort of those born in the 1970s.
In general, for both energy expenditure categories we may roughly
divide the 73 cohorts into two groups: the younger generations born
between 1947 and 1988 and 27 The F-value for age, cohort and year effects is respectively 12.79, 8.79 and 47.07. the older generations born between

1916 and 1946. For the younger generations, the cohort effect coefficients
are between 0 and −0.2 for both energy categories, with no
large inter-cohort difference in the pattern of spending. Intuitively, the
younger cohort grew up in the post-war period, a time of relative
peace and economic growth. For the older generation, the cohort effects
clearly show that cohorts born earlier spend less while those born later
spendmore (the coefficients drop from−0.2 to−1.08 for heating fuels
and −0.7 for electricity). Most of these cohorts lived through the war
and their spending attitudes were influenced by the experience.
7. Concluding remarks
The economics literature almost universally predicts that an aging
population will increase household energy consumption demand: older
households spend more on energy, and especially heating energy, because
their members are at home for a larger proportion of the day and
they usually need more heating comfort. However, this causal link is
more complex than expected because of the different pressures exerted
by socio-demographic transformations (longer life expectancy and smaller
family size), economic transformations (welfare state retrenchment,
changes in job market, income distribution), changes in lifestyle and environmental
attitudes, and last but not least global warming.
In this paper we have found evidence that in Italy population aging
can produce an even gloomier scenario: besides traditional drivers of
energy demand – income, demographics and dwelling characteristics
– the cohort effect interplays with the age effect to increase energy
consumption in newer generations. Indeed, by building cohort data
for Italian households, we have decomposed and estimated significant
positive age and negative cohort effects. Younger generations boost
energy consumption because they have higher residential energy expenditure
than the oldest cohorts observed. According to Stephenson
et al. (2015), different social norms, including individual expectations
and aspirations, interplay with material culture and energy practices
in shaping individual behaviour, subject to the external influences,
which form the context where energy cultures develop. We have
found hints of different energy culture clusters in consumption
attitudes: the war generation (attached to the idea of scarcity of goods
and energy dependency) and the baby-boom generation – people
currently aged 55 and over – which grew up during the golden age
of Italian development and is characterized by a technology-friendly
attitude. A growing number of elderly people in Italy seem to be in a
position to access goods associated with comfort and leisure – among
which electronic equipment and digital connectivity play a key role –
so a more active lifestyle and therefore a new energy culture call for
greater electricity demand. The energy culture of new Italian generations
also seems more strictly linked to thermal comfort (heating and
air conditioning) than to energy-saving attitudes and so an aging population
also means more residential energy demand.
In other words, a change in economic culture across generations
is shaping a more energy-intensive consumption pattern, as is also
signalled by the fact that the implementation of energy-saving technologies
can only partially offset the change in energy-use behaviour at the
country level (Fig. 1).
However, some factors can help to mitigate this alarming trend. On
the one hand, a more active lifestyle for elderly people can potentially
lead to smaller house occupancy. On the other hand, there are hints
that elderly Italian householders aremore concerned about the environment
than is traditionally expected in the economics literature: our data
showthat investment in residential solar energy equipment and household
renovation is also common among the older age classes.Moreover,
several surveys – such as the recent Eurobarometer waves – signal that
environment protection is also increasingly perceived as a key priority
among elderly people.
Public policies aimed at decreasing energy use are backed by the
EU and have been implemented in all developed countries. Besides economic
instruments grounded on the signal of carbon price, we argue
that policies specifically designed to shape energy cultures towards
more sustainable behaviour – taking into account the different lifestyles
and energy needs of overlapping generations – are crucial and can help
Italy to meet the energy-saving targets set at EU level.
