Abstract
Severe COVID-19 is characterized by lung abnormalities, including
the presence of syncytial pneumocytes. Syncytia form when SARSCoV-
2 spike protein expressed on the surface of infected cells
interacts with the ACE2 receptor on neighboring cells. The syncytia
forming potential of spike variant proteins remain poorly characterized.
Here, we first assessed Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351)
spread and fusion in cell cultures, compared with the ancestral
D614G strain. Alpha and Beta replicated similarly to D614G strain
in Vero, Caco-2, Calu-3, and primary airway cells. However, Alpha
and Beta formed larger and more numerous syncytia. Variant spike
proteins displayed higher ACE2 affinity compared with D614G.
Alpha, Beta, and D614G fusion was similarly inhibited by
interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). Individual
mutations present in Alpha and Beta spikes modified fusogenicity,
binding to ACE2 or recognition by monoclonal antibodies. We
further show that Delta spike also triggers faster fusion relative to
D614G. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants display enhanced
syncytia formation.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 was initially discovered during an outbreak in Wuhan,
China, before it became pandemic (Huang et al, 2020a). Since its
emergence, the ancestral Wuhan strain has been supplanted by variants
harboring a variety of mutations. Several of these mutations
occur in the highly antigenic Spike (S) protein which endowed
many of the variants with the ability to evade part of the neutralizing
antibody response (Weisblum et al, 2020; Planas et al, 2021a;
Liu et al, 2021b; Rees-Spear et al, 2021; Starr et al, 2021). Individual
amino acid changes in the S protein also affect viral fitness. One of
the earliest identified variants contained the D614G mutation in S
protein, which increased infectivity without significantly altering
antibody neutralization (Yurkovetskiy et al, 2020). Several other
variants have since emerged and have become globally dominant,
including Alpha (B.1.1.7) first identified in the United Kingdom,
Beta (B.1.351) identified in South Africa, Gamma (P.1 & P.2) identified
in Brazil, and Delta (B.1.617.2) identified in India (preprint:
Tegally et al, 2020; Buss et al, 2021; Frampton et al, 2021; Planas
et al, 2021b; Sabino et al, 2021; preprint: Yadav et al, 2021). Some
variants are more transmissible but their impact on disease severity
is debated (Korber et al, 2020; Davies et al, 2021; Meng et al, 2021).
Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infections range from asymptomatic or
febrile respiratory disorders to severe lung injury characterized by
vascular thrombosis and alveolar damage (Bussani et al, 2020). The
deterioration of respiratory tissue is likely a result of both virusinduced
cytopathicity and indirect immune-mediated damage
(Buchrieser et al, 2020; Zhang et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020; Zhu
et al, 2020). A peculiar dysmorphic cellular feature is the presence
of large infected multinucleated syncytia, predominately comprised
of pneumocytes (Bussani et al, 2020; Braga et al, 2021; Sanders

et al, 2021). Other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV,
and HKU1 also induce syncytia formation in patient tissues and cell
culture systems (Franks et al, 2003; Chan et al, 2013; Dominguez
et al, 2013; Qian et al, 2013). Syncytial cells may compound SARSCoV-
2-induced cytopathicity, play a role in viral persistence and
dissemination, and could be a pathological substrate for respiratory
tissue damage (Buchrieser et al, 2020; Braga et al, 2021; Sanders
et al, 2021). Release of syncytial cells may contribute to the overall
infectious dose (preprint: Beucher et al, 2021). Heterocellular syncytia
containing lymphocytes have also been documented in the lungs
of infected patients (Zhang et al, 2021).
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a viral fusogen. The interaction of
trimeric S with the ACE2 receptor and its subsequent cleavage and
priming by surface and endosomal proteases results in virus-cell
fusion (Hoffmann et al, 2020). Merging of viral and cellular
membranes allows for viral contents to be deposited into the cell to
begin the viral life cycle. Within the cell, newly synthesized S
protein, envelope, and membrane proteins are inserted into the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked and processed through
the ER-Golgi network (Nal et al, 2005; Duan et al, 2020; Cattin-
Ortola et al, 2021). Virion are formed by budding into ER-Golgi
membranes and are then transported to the surface in order to be
released from the cell (Klein et al, 2020). While the majority of the S
protein is sequestered within the ER, motifs within its cytoplasmic
tail allow for leakage from the Golgi apparatus and localization at
the plasma membrane (Cattin-Ortola et al, 2021). The S protein at
the surface of an infected cell interacts with receptors on adjacent
cells, fusing the plasma membranes together and merging the cytoplasmic
contents. We and others had previously shown that the S
protein interacting with the ACE2 receptor induces cell–cell fusion
(Buchrieser et al, 2020; Braga et al, 2021; Lin et al, 2021; Sanders
et al, 2021; Zhang et al, 2021). The TMPRSS2 protease further
augments cell–cell fusion (Buchrieser et al, 2020; Barrett et al, 2021;
Hornich et al, 2021).
The S protein is comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit
includes the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding
domain (RBD). The function of the NTD has yet to be fully elucidated
but it may be associated with glycan binding, receptor recognition,
and pre-fusion-to-post-fusion conformational changes. The
NTD is also targeted by neutralizing antibodies (Krempl et al, 1997;
Zhou et al, 2019; Chi et al, 2020). The RBD interacts with the ACE2
receptor and is the main target for neutralizing antibodies (Huang
et al, 2020b). The S2 domain consists of the fusion peptide (FP),
heptapeptide repeat sequences 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), the transmembrane
anchor, and the C-terminal domain. The FP inserts into
the target membrane by disrupting the lipid bilayer and anchors the
target membrane to the fusion machinery (Huang et al, 2020b). This
exposes regions of HR1 that interact with HR2, forming a flexible
loop that brings the membranes together to facilitate fusion (Huang
et al, 2020b). The versatility of the S protein suggests that any mutations
that may have arisen are of particular concern as they can
affect fusogenicity, antibody recognition, affinity to ACE2, proteolytic
processing, and incorporation into virions. There is a general
paucity of information regarding how the mutations associated with
variant S proteins contribute to cell–cell fusion.
S-mediated cell–cell fusion is sensitive to innate immunity
components. The interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the
key factors down-modulating viral entry and replication, and
deficiencies in the interferon response are associated with severe or
critical COVID-19 (Arunachalam et al, 2020; Bastard et al, 2020,
2021; Hadjadj et al, 2020; van der Made et al, 2020). SARS-CoV-2-
induced syncytia formation by the Wuhan strain is restricted by
innate immunity, in part through the action of interferon-induced
transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) (Buchrieser et al, 2020). IFITM1,
2, and 3 are restriction factors which display antiviral activity
against a variety of enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, likely
by increasing membrane rigidity and hindering virus–cell fusion
(Shi et al, 2021). Their effectiveness at restricting cell–cell fusion
induced by the novel variants has yet to be assessed.
Here, we compared the replication and syncytia forming potential
of D614G, Alpha, and Beta viruses in human cell lines and
primary airway cells. We further characterized the fusogenicity of
the Alpha and Beta variant S proteins and the individual contribution
of each of the component mutations in syncytia formation,
ACE2 binding, and evasion from a panel of antibodies. Finally, we
examined the syncytia forming potential and ACE2 binding capacity
of the Delta variant spike.
Results
Comparative replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 variants
We compared the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 variants in
relevant cell cultures. We first infected Caco-2, Calu-3, and Vero
cells with Alpha, Beta, and D614G variants and generated multistep
growth curves (Fig 1). Cells were infected at an equivalent,
non-saturating MOI, initially titrated in Vero cells (Appendix Fig
S1A). Viral replication was assessed at 24, 48, and 72 h by flow
cytometry upon staining with the pan-SARS-CoV-2 anti-S mAb102
human monoclonal antibody (Planas et al, 2021a) and then gating
for S+ cells (Appendix Fig S1B). Globally, the variants replicated
similarly (Fig 1). This similar replication was observed at different
MOIs (Appendix Fig S1A). There were subtle differences at 24 h
post-infection, depending on the cell line and the variant. For
instance, Beta replicated slightly more than D614G in Caco-2 cells
whereas Alpha replicated slight less than D614G in Vero cells
(Fig 1A and C). Viral release at each time point was also assessed
by extracting RNA from the supernatant and performing RT-qPCR
for the gene encoding the N protein. Viral release was again
roughly similar with the different variants, especially at early time
points. Alpha produced moderately more virus than D614G in all
cell lines at later time points (Fig 1A–C). Beta produced more
virus than D614G in Caco-2 but less in Calu-3 cells at later time
points (Fig 1A and B).
We then used the MucilAirBTM model, which consists of
primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) grown over a porous
membrane and differentiated at the air–liquid interface for over
4 weeks. This relevant model is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Pizzorno et al, 2020; Robinot et al, 2021; Touret et al, 2021).
The cells were infected with each variant at a similar low viral
inoculum (104 TCID50). Viral RNA and infectious virus release
were monitored over 96 h by RT-qPCR and TCID50. Alpha and
Beta variants produced slightly more extracellular viral RNA than
D614G at later time points but not significantly higher levels of
infectious particles (Fig 1D).

Taken together our data show that Alpha and Beta variants replicate
similarly to the ancestral D614G strain in a panel of human cell
lines and in primary cells, with some slight differences.
Syncytia formation in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants
We next assessed the potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants to induce
syncytia. In order to visualize cell–cell fusion, we employed our
previously described S-Fuse assay, using U2OS-ACE2 GFP-split cells
(Buchrieser et al, 2020). In the GFP-split complementation system,
two cell lines containing half of the reporter protein are co-cultured,
producing a GFP signal only upon fusion (Fig 2A). Upon infection
of S-Fuse cells, we noticed that the Alpha and Beta variants formed
larger and more numerous infected syncytia than either D614G or
the ancestral Wuhan strain (Fig EV1A). We then characterized
quantitatively the differences in fusogenicity by calculating the total
syncytia (GFP) area and then normalizing it to nuclei number
(Hoechst) (Fig EV1B). Relative to D614G, Alpha and Beta variants
produced significantly more syncytia, approximately 4.5-fold and
threefold respectively, after 20 h of infection with the same MOI
(Fig 2B and Appendix Fig S2A). In order to characterize syncytia
formation in a cell line expressing endogenous ACE2, we generated
Vero cells carrying the GFP-split system. After 48 h of infection with
the same MOI, we again found that Alpha and Beta variants
produced significantly more syncytia than D614G (Fig 2C and
Appendix Fig S2B) despite similar infection levels (Fig 1C). Of note,
D614G produced similar levels of syncytia as the Wuhan strain in
both Vero and S-Fuse cells (Fig 2 and Appendix Fig S2).
Therefore, Alpha and Beta variants appear more fusogenic than
D614G in S-Fuse and Vero cells.
Syncytia formation in cells expressing variant S proteins
Since syncytia formation is a consequence of the S protein expressed
on the surface of an infected cell interacting with ACE2 receptors on
neighboring cell, we sought to compare the fusogenic potential of
the individual variant S proteins. We introduced the D614G mutation
into the Wuhan protein and designed plasmids to express Alpha
and Beta S proteins. We transfected the respective plasmids into
Vero GFP-split cells and quantified syncytia formation 18 h later
(Fig 3A). Alpha and Beta S proteins were twofold and 1.7-fold more
fusogenic than D614G S, respectively (Fig 3B). The Wuhan S was
slightly less fusogenic that the D614G S (Fig 3B). We then verified
that the variation in S-mediated fusion was not due to differential
cell surface levels. Due to extensive fusion in transfected Vero cells,
we were unable to compare S protein surface expression (Fig 3B
and Movie EV1), as the S protein-positive syncytia were damaged
and lost during the flow cytometry procedure. As such, we transfected
293T cells, which lack ACE2 and thus will not fuse with one
another upon S expression, with the different variant plasmids in
order to assess S protein surface levels by flow cytometry. The variants
S proteins were equally expressed after transfection (Fig EV2A–
C). In order to unify the surface expression control with our fusion
results, we performed an acceptor/donor experiment. 293T GFP1-10
(donor) cells were transfected with each of the variant S plasmids.
The transfected donor cells (equal number for each transfection
condition) were then co-cultured with Vero GFP11 (acceptor) cells
(Fig EV2E). Some of the transfected 293T donor cells were set aside
and stained for S protein to show equal surface expression between
the variants (Fig EV2E). In the acceptor/donor co-culture, we found
that the 293T donor cells expressing the novel variant S proteins
formed more syncytia with the Vero acceptor cells than either the
D614G or Wuhan (Fig EV2E). The results of the acceptor/donor coculture
experiment matched our fusion results in Vero cells.
We then measured the kinetics of syncytia formation induced by
the different S proteins in Vero GFP-Split cells. We conducted a
comparative videomicroscopy analysis where cell–cell fusion could
be visualized as soon as 6 h post-transfection. The fusion kinetics of
Alpha S protein was more rapid than any of the other variants
(Fig 3C and Movie EV1). Beta also induced significantly faster
fusion than D614G, whereas the Wuhan S was the slowest of all the
compared proteins (Fig 3C and Movie EV1).
Altogether, our data indicate that the S proteins of Alpha and
Beta variants form more syncytia than the D614G or Wuhan strains.
Restriction of S-mediated syncytia formation by IFN-b1
and IFITMs
As the variants did not show any major difference in replication
under basal conditions, we next investigated whether they were differently
sensitive to the interferon response. To this aim, we pretreated
Vero cells or U2OS-ACE2 (S-Fuse) cells with increasing doses
of IFN-b1 and infected them with the different variants. IFN-b1 was
equally effective at reducing viral replication of D614G, Alpha, and
Beta variants in Vero cells (Fig EV3A). Preincubation of S-Fuse cells
with IFN-b1 also abrogated infection and syncytia formation to the
same extent for the different variants (Fig EV3B). Therefore, IFN-b1
similarly inhibited viral replication and reduced syncytia formation
by D614G, Alpha, and Beta variants.
IFITMs are interferon-stimulated transmembrane proteins that
restrict early stages of the viral life cycle by inhibiting virus-cell
fusion, likely by modifying the rigidity or curvature of membranes
(Compton et al, 2014; Shi et al, 2017; Zani & Yount, 2018). IFITM1
localizes at the plasma membrane while IFITM2 and 3 transit
through surface and localize in endo-lysosomal compartments
(Buchrieser et al, 2020). We previously reported that IFITMs restrict
Wuhan S-mediated cell–cell fusion and that their activity was counteracted
by the TMPRSS2 protease (Buchrieser et al, 2020). As infection
with Alpha and Beta induce more syncytia, we further
investigated if this resulted in an increased resistance to IFITM

restriction. We thus characterized the impact of IFITMs on syncytia
formed upon expression of D614G, Alpha, and Beta S proteins in
293T cells. The variants were all effectively restricted by IFITMs
(Fig EV3C–G). The three IFITMs were expressed at similar levels in

fusion of all S proteins and reverted the restriction by IFITMs

(Fig EV3C–G). Taken together, our data show that Alpha and Beta
variants induce more syncytia, but their S proteins remain similarly
sensitive to IFITMs.
Contribution of individual variant-associated mutations on
S protein-mediated fusogenicity
We next sought to determine the contribution of each variantassociated
mutation to cell–cell fusion. Both Alpha and Beta S
proteins contain the N501Y mutation in the RBD and the D614G
mutation in the S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig 4A). Alpha S contains
the Δ69/70 and ΔY144 deletions in the N-terminal domain (NTD),
P681H and T716I mutations in the S1/S2 cleavage site, the S982A
mutation in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) site and the D1118H mutation
in between HR1 and HR2. The Beta S is comprised of the
L18F, D80A, D215G, and Δ242-244 mutations in the NTD, K417N
and E484K mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and
A701V in the S1/S2 cleavage site. We introduced individual mutations
into the D614G background. Following reports of the emergence
of the E484K mutation within the Alpha variant (Collier
et al, 2021), we also generated a mutant Alpha S protein with
the E484K mutation. We observed by flow cytometry that the
mutant S proteins were similarly expressed at the cell surface
(Fig EV2A–D). We expressed each mutant S into Vero GFP split
cells and measured their potential to induce cell–cell fusion in
comparison to the D614G S protein.
Of the mutations that are associated with Alpha, we found that
the Δ69/70 deletion in the NTD decreased cell–cell fusion whereas
P681H and D1118H substitutions both increase fusion (Figs 4A and
EV4E). P681H displayed the greatest fusogenicity of all investigated
mutations, being almost 2.5-fold higher than D614G S (Figs 4A and
EV4E). As previously mentioned, the introduction of the D614G
mutation in the S1/S2 border of the Wuhan S protein also relatively
increased fusion, stressing the importance of this cleavage site in
fusogenicity (Fig 3B).
Among the mutations associated with Beta, the Δ242-244 deletion,
as well as the K417N and E484K mutations in the RBD significantly
decreased syncytia formation (Figs 4A and EV4F). Only the
D251G mutation in the NTD modestly increased syncytia formation
relative to D614G (Figs 4A and EV4F). The introduction of the
E484K RBD mutation into the Alpha S protein significantly
decreased its potential to form syncytia, despite not changing cell
surface expression, further supporting the mutation’s restrictive
effect on cell–cell fusion (Figs 4B and EV2B). Taken together, our
data suggest that variant S proteins are comprised of mutations that
play contrasting roles in cell–cell fusion. P681H, D1118H, and
D215G substitutions facilitate fusion, whereas mutations Δ69/70,
Δ242-244, K417N, and E484K antagonize cell–cell fusion.
Binding of S proteins bearing individual variant-associated
mutations to ACE2
We next explored the impact of variant-associated mutations on S
binding to the ACE2 receptor. To this aim, we transiently expressed
each mutant protein in 293T cells. Cells were then stained with a
serial dilution of soluble biotinylated ACE2, revealed with fluorescent
streptavidin, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig 5A).
Titration binding curves were generated, and EC50 (the amount of
ACE2 needed for 50% binding) was calculated. The S protein of
Alpha had the highest affinity to ACE2, confirming previous results
by us and others (Planas et al, 2021; Ramanathan et al, 2021). Alpha
was sequentially followed by Beta, D614G, and Wuhan S (Figs 5B
and EV5A). As expected, mutations within the RBD had the most
significant impact on ACE2 binding. N501Y found in both Alpha
and Beta drastically increased ACE2 binding, in line with previous
reports indicating that this mutation enhances affinity of the viral
protein to its receptor (Ali et al, 2021; Luan et al, 2021; Tian et al,
2021). The K417N substitution present in the Beta S decreased
ACE2 binding (Figs 5B and EV5C). The E484K mutant had a
slightly, but not significantly, higher binding to ACE2 (Fig EV5C).
This was corroborated by the observation that addition of the E484K
mutation to Alpha S protein also slightly increased ACE2 binding
(Figs 5B and EV5A). Mutation in the S1/S2 cleavage site, HR1/HR2
sites, or NTD did not have any significant impact on ACE2 binding
(Figs 5B and EV5B–E). It is worth noting that the NTD Δ242-244
mutant displayed a marginally lower binding to ACE2 (Figs 5B and
EV5B). Therefore, the N501Y mutation is the most significant
contributor to increased ACE2 binding of the variants, though it
does not affect cell–cell fusion on its own. The K417N, Δ242-244,
and E484K mutations restrict fusogenicity but differently affect
ACE2 binding, with the former two decreasing affinity and the latter
slightly increasing.
Therefore, ACE2 binding and fusogenicity are two functions of
the S protein that can be partially deconvoluted through individual
mutations.
Antibody binding to S proteins bearing individual
variant-associated mutations
We had previously found that certain neutralizing antibodies differentially
affect SARS-CoV-2 D614G, Alpha, and Beta variants
(Planas et al, 2021a). For instance, neutralizing monoclonal antibody
48 (mAb48) restricts D614G virus but not Alpha or Beta variants
(Planas et al, 2021a). We sought to determine which mutations
in variant S proteins contributed to the lack of recognition by the
neutralizing antibodies. To this aim, we assessed by flow cytometry
the binding of a panel of four human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
to the different S mutants. As a control we used mAb10, a pancoronavirus
antibody that targets an unknown but conserved
epitope within the S2 region (Planchais, manuscript in preparation).
mAb10 equally recognized all variants and associated individual
mutations (Fig 5C). mAb48 and mAb98 target the RBD and mAb71
the NTD (Planas et al, 2021b) (Planchais, manuscript in preparation).
mAb48 did not recognize the Beta variant and more specifically
did not bind to the K417N mutant (Fig 5C). The mAb71
recognized neither Alpha nor Beta variants and did not bind to their
respective NTD ΔY144 and Δ242-244 mutations. The K417N and
Δ242-244 mutations were also responsible for decreasing Smediated
fusion, suggesting a tradeoff between antibody escape and
fusion (Fig 5C). mAb98 did not recognize the Beta variant.
However, none of the associated mutations were specifically responsible
for the lack of binding (Fig 5C), suggesting a combined effect
on the structure of the S protein that may affect antibody escape.
Therefore, several of the mutations found in the variants S
proteins are advantageous in terms of antibody escape, despite
slightly reducing the ability of the proteins to fuse.

S protein-mediated syncytia formation by the Delta variant
With the emergence and rapid spread of the Delta variant, we
sought to characterize its potential to form syncytia. We recently
showed that the Delta variant induces large syncytia in S-Fuse cells
(Planas et al, 2021b). We thus compared the fusogenicity of the
Delta S protein to that of D614G and Alpha. We transiently
expressed the three S proteins in Vero GFP-split cells. The Delta S
protein triggered more cell–cell fusion than the D614G variant but
was similar to the Alpha S protein (Fig 6A). The fusion kinetic of
the Delta S was also similar to Alpha but more rapid than D614G
(Fig 6B). We confirmed that the variant S proteins were equally
expressed on the surface by transfecting them into non-fusogenic
293T cells and performing flow cytometry upon staining with the
pan-SARS-CoV-2 mAb129 (Fig EV2D). We next examined the ACE2
binding potential of Delta S protein using our aforementioned

soluble biotinylated ACE2. The Delta S protein has a higher binding
capacity to ACE2 than the D614G S protein, but the binding was
lower than the Alpha S protein (Fig 6C).
S protein-mediated syncytia formation and TMPRSS2
We then asked whether the TMPRSS2 protease, which cleaves S and
facilitates viral fusion, may act differently on the variant S proteins.
To this aim, we generated a Caco2 GFP-split cell line and then
expressed the different S proteins to examine fusogenicity. Human
Caco2 cells express endogenous levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2. In
line with our results in Vero cells which lack endogenous TMPRSS2
(Fig 3B), we found that the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants fused
more than the D614G, and the Wuhan S protein fused the least
(Fig 6D). Thus, the differences in variant fusogenicity can also be
visualized in the presence of TMPRSS2. In order to see whether
TMPRSS2 differentially processes the variants S proteins, we
expressed each of them without or with TMPRSS2 in 293T cells in
the absence ACE2. We examined the processing of the different S by
western blot and the expression levels of S1 and S2 by flow cytometry.
While all S proteins are processed, the cleavage profile induced
by TMPRSS2 and the expression levels between the different variant
S proteins were similar (Appendix Fig S3).
Discussion
The replication and cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants are
under intense scrutiny, with contrasting results in the literature
(Hou et al, 2020; Frampton et al, 2021; Leung et al, 2021; preprint:
Liu et al, 2021a; Touret et al, 2021). For instance, there was no
major difference in the replication kinetics of Alpha and D614G
strains in some reports (preprint: Thorne et al, 2021; Touret et al,
2021), whereas others suggested that Alpha may outcompete D614G
in a co-infection assay (Touret et al, 2021). Some studies proposed
that the N501Y mutation may provide a replication advantage,
whereas others suggested that N501Y is deleterious (Hou et al,
2020; Frampton et al, 2021; Leung et al, 2021; preprint: Liu et al,
2021a). These discrepant results may be due to the use of different
experimental systems, viral strains, multiplicities of infection, and
cell types.
Here, we show that Alpha and Beta variants replicate to the
same extent as the early D614G strain in different human cell
lines and primary airway cells. Moreover, Alpha and Beta
induced more cell–cell fusion than D614G. Increased fusion was
observed in U2OS-ACE2 cells and in naturally permissive Vero
cells. In agreement with infection data, transfection of Alpha and
Beta S proteins in the absence of any other viral factors,
produced significantly more syncytia than D614G, which in turn,
fused more than the Wuhan S. Comparative video microscopy
analysis revealed that Alpha S fused the most rapidly, followed
by Beta, D614G, and finally Wuhan. Thus, Alpha and Beta variants
display enhanced S-mediated syncytia formation. One limitation
of our study resides in the fact that were unable to look at
surface expression of the variant S proteins in Vero and Caco2
without losing the large S protein-positive syncytia. We thus used
the non-fusogenic 293T cells to control for surface expression.
We further show that S-expressing 293T cells fuse with Vero cells
in donor/acceptor experiments. The experiments confirmed the
enhanced fusogenicity of the variants in cells with similar levels
of S protein at their surface.
We further show that Alpha and Beta remain sensitive to restriction
by IFN-b1. The fusion mediated by their respective S proteins is
inhibited by IFITMs. This extends previous results by us and others
demonstrating that ancestral Wuhan S is effectively inhibited by this
family of restriction factors (Buchrieser et al, 2020; Shi et al, 2021).
It has been recently reported in a pre-print that Alpha may lead to
lower levels of IFN-b1 production by infected Calu-3 cells and may
be less sensitive to IFN-b pre-treatment, when compared to first
wave viral isolates (preprint: Thorne et al, 2021). We did not detect
here differences of IFN-b1 sensitivity between the variants in Vero
and U2OS-ACE2 cells. Again, these discrepant results may reflect
inherent differences between Calu-3, Vero, and U2OS-ACE2 cells, or
the use of different viral isolates.
We then characterized the contribution of the individual mutations
present in Alpha and Beta S proteins to their respective fusogenicity.
The highly fusogenic Alpha S consists of more mutations
that robustly increase fusion (P681H and D1118H) than mutations
that decrease fusion (Δ69/70). In contrast, the Beta variant is
comprised of several restrictive mutations (Δ242-244, K417N, and
E484K) and only one mutation that modestly increased fusion
(D215G). The strongest increase in fusion was elicited by the P681H
mutation at the S1/S2 border. This mutation likely facilitates proteolytic
cleavage of S and thus promotes S mediate cell–cell fusion.
Indeed, the analogous P681R mutation present in B.1.617.2 and
B.1.617.3 variants increases S1/S2 cleavage and facilitates syncytia
formation (Jiang et al, 2020; preprint: Ferreira et al, 2021). Of note,

suggested a mild decrease or no difference in cell–cell fusion of
Alpha and Beta relative to Wuhan S (Hoffmann et al, 2021). These
previous experiments were performed in 293T cells at a late time
points (24 h post-transfection), which may preclude detection of the
accelerated fusion triggered by the variants.
We show that the binding of variant S to soluble ACE2 paralleled
their fusogenicity. Alpha bound the most efficiently to ACE2,
followed by Beta, D614G, and finally Wuhan. However, the ACE2
affinity of S proteins carrying individual mutations did not exactly
correlate to fusogenicity. For instance, the N501Y and D614G mutations
drastically increased ACE2 affinity, but only D614G enhanced
fusogenicity. The K417N substitution, and to a lesser degree Δ242–
244, had a lower affinity to ACE2 and also restricted cell–cell fusion.
The E484K mutation significantly restricts fusion, but mildly
increases ACE2 affinity. This suggests that on the level of individual
S mutations, the relationship between ACE2 affinity and increased
fusogenicity is not always linear. Variant mutations may also confer
advantages in an ACE2-independent manner. Indeed, recent work
has suggested that the E484 mutation may facilitate viral entry into
H522 lung cells, requiring surface heparan sulfates rather than
ACE2 (Puray-Chavez et al, 2021). It would be of future interest to
examine the syncytia formation potential of the variant mutations in
other cell types.
We selected a panel of 4 mAbs that displayed different profiles
of binding to Alpha, Beta, D614G, and Wuhan S proteins. The
mAb10 targeting the S2 domain recognized all variants and was
used as a positive control. Wuhan and D614G were recognized by
the three other antibodies, targeting either the NTD or RBD. Alpha
lost recognition by the anti-NTD mAb71, whereas Beta was neither
recognized by mab71 nor by the two anti-RBD antibodies mAb48
and mAb 98. Upon examining the potential of S proteins carrying
individual mutations to bind to human monoclonal antibodies, we
found that the ones that restrict (Δ242–244, K417N) or have no
effect on fusogenicity (ΔY144) are also not recognized by some
mAbs. This suggests that variant S proteins have undergone evolutionary
trade-off in some circumstances, selecting for mutations
that provide antibody escape at the detriment of fusogenicity. In
accordance with our findings, deep sequence binding analysis and
in vitro evolution studies suggest the N501Y mutation increases
affinity to ACE2 without disturbing antibody neutralization
(preprint: Liu et al, 2021a; Starr et al, 2021; Zahradnık et al,
2021). The E484K and K417N RBD mutations in the Beta variant
may also increase ACE2 affinity, particularly when in conjunction
with N501Y (preprint: Nelson et al, 2021; Zahradnık et al, 2021).
However, the resulting conformational change of the S protein
RBD may also decrease sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies
(preprint: Nelson et al, 2021). Future work assessing the structural
and conformational changes in the S protein elicited by a combination
of individual mutations or deletions may further help elucidate
the increased fusogenicity and antibody escape potential of
the variants.
While we had previously shown that the interaction between
the S protein on the plasma membrane with the ACE2 receptor
on neighboring cells is sufficient to induce syncytia formation,
there is compelling evidence of the importance of the TMPRSS2
protease in S activation (Buchrieser et al, 2020; Dittmar et al,
2021; Koch et al, 2021; Ou et al, 2021). We found that the S
protein of the novel variants induced more syncytia formation
than the D614G and Wuhan S proteins in human Caco2 cells
which express endogenous ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, we did
not detect any major differences in the processing of the variant
S proteins by TMPRSS2. It will be worth further characterizing
how the fusogenicity of variant-associated mutations is influenced
by other cellular proteases like furin.
The presence of infected syncytial pneumocytes was documented
in the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 (Bussani et al, 2020;
Tian et al, 2020; Xu et al, 2020). Syncytia formation may contribute
to SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread, immune evasion, and tissue
damage. A report using reconstituted bronchial epithelia found that
viral infection results in the formation and release of infected syncytia
that contribute to the infectious dose (preprint: Beucher et al,
2021). The neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
has divergent effect on cell–cell fusion, with some antibodies
restricting S-mediated fusion, while other increase syncytia formation
(Asarnow et al, 2021). Cell-to-cell spread of virus may be less
sensitive to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent
plasma than cell-free virus (preprint: Jackson et al, 2021). It is
thus possible that infected syncytial cells facilitate viral spread.
Within this context, it is necessary to better understand the fusogenic
potential of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that have arisen and will
continue to emerge.
We have characterized here the replication, fusogenicity, ACE2
binding, and antibody recognition of Alpha and Beta variants and
the role of their S-associated mutations. Despite the insights we
provide into the S-mediated fusogenicity of the variants, we did not
address the conformational changes that the mutations individually
or in combination may elicit. We further show that Alpha, Beta, and
Delta S proteins more efficiently bind to ACE2 and are more fusogenic
than D614G. The virological and immunological features of
the Delta variant which explain its higher transmissibility rate
compared to the Alpha and other variants at the population level
remains an outstanding question.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids
A codon-optimized version of the reference Wuhan SARS-CoV-2
Spike (GenBank: QHD43416.1) was ordered as a synthetic gene
(GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was cloned into a phCMV
backbone (GeneBank: AJ318514), by replacing the VSV-G gene. The
mutations for Alpha and Beta (Fig 4A) were added in silico to the
codon-optimized Wuhan strain and ordered as synthetic genes
(GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cloned into the same backbone
(Planas et al, 2021a). The D614G S plasmid was generated by
introducing the mutation into the Wuhan reference strain via Q5
site-directed mutagenesis (NEB). Other individual mutations were
subsequently introduced into the D614G S by the same process.
Plasmids were sequenced prior to use. The primers used for
sequencing and the site-directed mutagenesis are listed in the
tables (Tables EV1 and EV2). pQCXIP-Empty control plasmid,

Cells
Vero E6, HEK293T, U2OS, Caco2/TC7, Calu3 were cultured in
DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(PS). Vero and 293T GFP-split cells transduced cells with
pQCXIP were cultured with 4 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml of puromycin
(InvivoGen), respectively. U2OS GFP-split cells transduced with
pLenti6 were cultured in 1 μg/ml puromycin and 10 μg/ml blasticidin
(InvivoGen). The MucilAirTM primary human bronchial epithelial
model was previously described (Robinot et al, 2021). All cells
lines were either purchased from ATCC or were kind donations from
members of the Institut Pasteur and were routinely screened for
mycoplasma.
Viruses
Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 isolates were performed in a BSL-3
laboratory, following safety and security protocols approved by the
risk prevention service of Institut Pasteur. The Wuhan SARS-CoV-2
strain (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020) and the D614G strain
(hCoV-19/France/GE1973/2020) were supplied by Dr. S. van der
Werf of the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses (Institut
Pasteur, Paris, France). The D614G viral strain was sourced
through the European Virus Archive goes Global (EVAg) platform,
which is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research
and innovation program under grant agreement 653316. The Alpha
strain was isolated in Tours, France, from an individual who
returned from the United Kingdom. The Beta strain (CNRT
202100078) originated from an individual in Creteil, France.
Informed consent was provided by the individuals for use of their
biological materials. The viruses were isolated from nasal swabs on
Vero cells and further amplified one or two passages on Vero cells.
The viruses were sequenced directly from the nasal squabs and
again upon passaging. Titration of viral stocks was performed by
50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50).
Viral release
For quantification of extracellular viral RNA, supernatants were
diluted and heat-inactivated for 20 min at 80°C. qRT-PCR was
performed from 1 μl of template RNA in a final volume of 5 ll per
reaction in 384-well plates using the Luna Universal Probe One-Step
RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) with SARS-CoV-2 N-specific
primers (Table EV1) on a QuantStudio 6 Flex thermocycler (Applied
Biosystems). Standard curve was performed in parallel using purified
SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Infectious virus release was assessed by
harvesting supernatant at each time point and preforming a TCID50
assay using Vero cells.
GFP-split fusion assay
For cell–cell fusion assays, Vero, U2OS-ACE2, or 293T cell lines
stably expressing GFP1-10 and GFP11 were co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio
(3 × 104, 2 × 104, and 7 × 104 cells/well total, respectively) and
were transfected in suspension with a total of 100 ng of DNA with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo) in a 96-well plate (uClear, #655090).

25 ng of pCSDest-TMPRSS2, and 40 ng of pQCXIP-IFITM were used
and adjusted to 100 ng DNA with pQCXIP-Empty (control plasmid).
At 20 h post-transfection, images covering 80–90% of the well
surface, were acquired per well on an Opera Phenix High-Content
Screening System (PerkinElmer). The GFP area and the number of
nuclei were quantified on Harmony High-Content Imaging and Analysis
Software (Fig EV1B). For infection, cells were plated at the
aforementioned concentrations and infected the next day with a
range of MOIs and fixed at 20 h (U2OS-ACE) or 48 h (Vero) postinfection
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. For video microscopy
experiments, Vero GFP-split cells (mixed 1:1) were transfected
in suspension with 50 ng of phCMV-SARS-CoV2-S and 450 ng of
pQCXIP-Empty for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed twice and then
seeded at a confluency of 2 × 105 cells per quadrant in a u-Dish 35-
mm Quad dish (Ibidi #80416). Cells were allowed to settle, and fluorescence
images were taken at 37°C every 10 min up to 24 h using a
Nikon BioStation IMQ, with three fields for each condition. Fusion
defined as percent of GFP pixels was calculated with ImageJ.
Flow cytometry
For ACE2 binding, 293T cells transfected with S proteins for 24 h
were stained with soluble biotinylated ACE2 diluted in MACS buffer
at indicated concentrations (from 60 to 0.01 μg/ml) for 30 min at
4°C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
1:400) for 30 min at 4°C. Finally, the cells were washed twice
with PBS and then fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde. The results were
acquired using an Attune Nxt Flow Cytometer (Life Technologies).
Transfection efficiency was assessed by staining with pan-SARS-CoV-
2 human mAb129. Antibody binding to S proteins was assessed by an
analogous protocol where transfected 293T cells were first stained
with either human mAb10 (pan-coronavirus anti-S2), mAb102 and
mAb129 (pan-SARS-CoV-2), mAb48 and mAb98 (SARS-CoV-2 anti-
RBD), and mAb71 (SARS-CoV-2 anti-NTD) at 1 μg/ml. The antibodies
were derived from convalescent individuals by the Mouquet laboratory
at the Institut Pasteur. mAb10 was generated during the early
stages of the epidemic from a patient infected with the Wuhan strain
and thus has a higher affinity for the Wuhan S protein (Planas et al,
2021a). For viral replication, infected cells were fixed at each time
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were stained in the
same manner described above with anti-spike mAb102 and
secondary Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500) in MACS buffer containing 0.05%
saponin. The gating strategy to determine S protein-positive cells is
represented in the supplement (Appendix Fig S1B).
Western Blot
Cells were lysed in TXNE buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors) for
30 min on ice. Equal amounts (20–50 lg) of cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blot. The following antibodies were diluted in
WB buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween, 0.01% Na Azide): rabbit
anti-human TMPRSS2 (Atlas antibodies cat# HPA035787, 1:1,000),
rabbit anti-human actin (Sigma cat#A2066, 1:2,000), and human
anti-S serum derived from a convalescent individual (1:1,000).
Species-specific secondary DyLight-coupled antibodies were used
(diluted 1:10,000 in WB buffer) and proteins were revealed using a
Licor Imager. Images were processed using Image Studio Lite
software.
