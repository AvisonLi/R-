The abundance of beach litter has been increasing globally during the last decades, and it is an issue of global
concern. A new survey strategy, based on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV, aka drones), has been recently adopted
to improve the monitoring of beach macro-litter items abundance and distribution.
This work identified and analysed the 15 studies that used drone for beach litter surveys on an operational
basis. The analysis of technical parameters for drone flight deployment revealed that flight altitude varied between
5 and 40 m. The analysis of final assessments showed that, through manual and/or automated items
detection on images, most of studies provided litter bulk characteristics (type, material and size), along with
litter distribution maps.
The potential standardization of drone-based litter survey would allow a comparison among surveys, however
it seems difficult to propose a standard set of flight parameters, given the wide variety of coastal environments,
the different devices available, and the diverse objectives of drone-based litter surveys. On the other hand, in our
view, a set of common outcomes can be proposed, based on the grid mapping process, which can be easily
generated following the procedure indicated in the paper.
This work sets the ground for the development of a standardized protocol for drone litter data collection,
analysis and assessments. This would allow the provision of broad scale comparative studies to support coastal
management at both national and international scales.
1. Introduction
The amount of litter in the marine environment is a major issue of
global concern, as the abundance of litter has been increasing globally
during the last decades (Galgani et al., 2015). Marine litter is a major
threat to a sustainable planet, as affecting coastal water quality and
ecosystems, and it can be harmful to marine life and humans (Galgani
et al., 2019; Staffieri et al., 2019; Werner et al., 2016; Woods et al.,
2021). Roughly 80% of marine litter pollution originates on land
(Jambeck et al., 2015), and enters the ocean via rivers (Meijer et al.,
2021), land-based sources (Schwarz et al., 2019), extreme events
(Murray et al., 2018) and coastal erosion (Andriolo and Gonçalves,
2022), among others (Veiga et al., 2016). Eventually, a large portion of
litter ends up on the beach over a five-year period (Chassignet et al.,
2021). Therefore, investigating litter distribution and accumulation is
fundamental for a sustainable coastal zone management (GESAMP,
2019). Different remote sensing techniques have been applied to
advance knowledge of litter abundance, distribution and dynamics over
the last decade. Images acquired by balloon and airplanes equipped with
cameras (Kako et al., 2012; Kataoka et al., 2018; Moy et al., 2018),
webcams (Kako et al., 2018, 2010; Kataoka et al., 2012) and satellites
(Biermann et al., 2020; Ciappa, 2022, 2021; Martínez-Vicente et al.,
2019; Maximenko et al., 2019; Topouzelis et al., 2019) have been
exploited to detect and quantify litter in marine and coastal habitats

worldwide.
Regarding beach litter, the most common approach rely mainly on
in-situ visual census method, which requires a certain number of operators,
it is human effort-demanding, time-consuming and spatially
limited (e.g., GESAMP, 2019; OSPAR Commission, 2010; Portz et al.,
2021; Rangel-Buitrago et al., 2018). To overcome the visual census
constraints, new approaches are required to fasten and to automate the
beach litter mapping and dynamics.
In this context, the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV, aka drones)
has exponentially increased for environmental monitoring (Manfreda
et al., 2018; Tmuˇsi et al., 2020), and can support the identification and
quantification of litter in coastal environment (Andriolo et al., 2022;
Garcia-Garin et al., 2020), since these aerial platforms can operate
autonomously, provide high resolution images, and are viable and
affordable tools for many operational surveys. It has been recently
demonstrated that drones can be used to survey macro-litter (>2.5 cm,
GESAMP, 2019) on different ecosystems, such as coastlines (Bao et al.,
2018; Escobar-S´anchez et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021, 2018; Merlino
et al., 2020), islands shores (Deidun et al., 2018; Fallati et al., 2019;
Papakonstantinou et al., 2021, 2019; Takaya et al., 2022), beach-dune
systems (Andriolo et al., 2021b, 2020b; Gonçalves et al., 2020b; Taddia
et al., 2021) and lakeshores (Hengstmann and Fischer, 2020). In
comparison with traditional surveys, drones allow to map litter over
wide and remote areas (e.g., Andriolo et al., 2020a; Fallati et al., 2019;
Gonçalves et al., 2020b), reduce the human effort in the field (e.g.,
Martin et al., 2018), and eventually identify litter distribution and
hotspots of litter deposition (e.g., Andriolo et al., 2021b, 2020b).
The twofold aim of this work is i) to report and analyse the operational
insights into the use of drones for mapping macro-litter on coastal
areas, and ii) to set the ground of a likely standardization strategy for
drone-based beach litter survey. First, we identified in the literature the
studies that used drones for operational purposes, providing the actual
survey of beach litter. Secondly, we revised and compared the technical
parameters adopted by different studies for drone deployment in the
field. Thirdly, we analysed litter survey assessments, to identify the
analogies among studies, despite the different chosen technical parameters.
Finally, the likely strategies for drone-based litter survey standardization
are discussed, since it is of interest to harmonize assessments
for comparison purpose among surveys conducted worldwide. This work
is devoted to promote the use of drones for improving knowledge of
litter abundance, composition and dynamics on coasts.
2. Beach litter survey by drone
Based on the experience gained by the authors of this review in
several works (Andriolo et al., 2021b, 2021a; 2020b, 2020a; Gonçalves
et al., 2020b; Gonçalves and Andriolo, 2022), a general schematic
framework for operational beach litter survey by autonomously flying
multirotor drones was drawn (Fig. 1).
The first stage comprises the planning of the field experience. Beside
complying with the drone flight local, regional and national law regulations,
it is necessary to verify the weather forecast for choosing an
unrainy and unwind day. Most commercial drones can fly with wind
speed below about 30 km/h, a nominal value indicated by the drone
company and based on drone models. To optimize the flight planning, it
was also a good practice to account for tide and beach configuration,
especially on mesotidal environments (Andriolo et al., 2020b; Gonçalves
et al., 2020b), where litter was mostly found on the upper beach limit
reached by the last highest last tide (Andriolo et al., 2020b; Gonçalves
et al., 2020b).
The second stage implies the drone flight deployment. Drone freeware
mobile applications (e.g., https://www.dronedeploy.com/)
allowed to i) design the flight path, ii) select the flight altitude and
speed, iii) set camera parameters, namely image size, focal length, ISO,
shutter speed and image overlap. Drone flight altitude and camera set up
are commonly chosen to obtain a suitable Ground Sampling Distance
(GSD) for distinguishing macro-litter items on images. The GSD expresses
the pixel spatial resolution of drone images (Linder, 2016):
GSD=
H
f • a (1)
where H is the flight altitude (m), f is the camera focal length (mm), and
a is the pixel size (mm). When all parameters are set, applications return
the predicted flight time and the battery consumption in relation to
battery autonomy.
The third stage encompasses the drone image analysis. The acquired
sequence of images can be both used to generate geospatial products (e.
g., orthophoto), and/or examined as a series of (raw) images. To identify
litter objects, orthophoto and/or raw images can be analysed adopting
the manual image screening (MS), which consists in i) visually recognizing
litter on image, ii) marking the items, and iii) labelling the item
type, material and colour (Andriolo et al., 2021a). Besides, litter
detection algorithms can be developed to fasten and automate the object
recognition (Duarte et al., 2020; Gonçalves et al., 2020c; Pinto et al.,
2021; Wolf et al., 2020).
The final fourth stage describes the litter survey assessments. The
litter bulk derived by the (manual and/or automated) image analysis can
be characterized through the counting of objects, and/or the description
of type (e.g., bottles, octopus pots, etc.) and materials (e.g., plastics,
paper, etc.), and/or the final litter map identified on the surveyed area.
3 Review selection method and analysis of drone deployment
parameters
For this review, we identified in the literature the studies that i) used
drone for surveying beach litter, ii) completed the four stages of the
workflow previously described (Fig. 1), and iii) eventually characterized
the surveyed litter bulk on an operational basis. Only studies that used
RGB images were considered, excluding the recent work that adopted

drone-mounted multispectral camera (Gonçalves and Andriolo, 2022).
Overall, we identified 15 studies conducted in Europe (Andriolo
et al., 2021b, 2020b; 2020a; Deidun et al., 2018; Escobar-S´anchez et al.,
2021; Gonçalves et al., 2020b; Hengstmann and Fischer, 2020; Merlino
et al., 2020; Papakonstantinou et al., 2021; Taddia et al., 2021) and Asia
(Bao et al., 2018; Fallati et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2021, 2018; Takaya
et al., 2022). No publications from other continents were found (Fig. 2).
Table 1 summarizes the field experiences data and drone flight parameters
adopted by the 15 studies for completing the first two stages of
drone-based litter surveys workflow (Fig. 1). Regarding the choice of
drone model, all studies used multirotor drones from DJI brand (www.
dji.com), perhaps due to the cost-effective properties of these devices.
Diverse models were adopted, which slightly varied for in-built camera
properties. Overall, DJI Phantom 4 Pro was the most used.
Different flight altitudes were adopted, depending on the chosen area
extent and/or the level of details on image required for their study objectives.
The chosen flight altitude varied between 5 m (Takaya et al.,
2022) and 40 m (Hengstmann and Fischer, 2020), with an average value
of about 20 m among the considered 15 studies. Five of them (33%)
choose an altitude of 10 m, while six (40%) flew at a height equal or
higher than 20 m. The final GSD varied between 0.01 cm/px and 1.2
cm/px, for a median value of 0.54 cm/px. With such median GSD, a litter
object measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm, for instance, would be theoretically
represented by a square of 16 pixels on drone images. Note that the
lower or higher GSD not always matched lower or higher flight altitude,
since the final resolution depended on the camera properties (Table 1).
The choice of the flight height depended also on the objective of the
study, since i) several studies tested different GSDs for the litter identification
by flying at various altitudes (Escobar-S´anchez et al., 2021;
Fallati et al., 2019; Hengstmann and Fischer, 2020; Taddia et al., 2021),
ii) some studies tested drone surveys for developing automated detection
algorithms (Bao et al., 2018; Papakonstantinou et al., 2021; Takaya
et al., 2022), iii) other studies chose to fly at higher altitude to cover a
larger area (Andriolo et al., 2020a, 2020b; Gonçalves et al., 2020b).
Some studies monitored the typical 100-m beach longshore transect
adopted in the conventional visual census (OSPAR Commission, 2010),
to investigate the feasibility of drones as alternative to traditional surveys
(Deidun et al., 2018; Escobar-S´anchez et al., 2021), and to increase
the number of surveys over the year (Merlino et al., 2020). However, in
general, most of studies exploited the drone to cover a wider coastal
area, also to relate litter distribution with environmental forcing (such
as wind and waves) and beach slope (Andriolo et al., 2020b; Gonçalves
et al., 2020b), dune vegetation (Andriolo et al., 2021b, 2020a), and
shoreline configuration (Martin et al., 2021, 2018).
From the image bulk collected by drones, most of studies generated
and used the georeferenced orthophoto. Even though three studies used
raw drone images (e.g., Papakonstantinou et al., 2021), litter items were
geolocated exploiting the spatial information provided by image
metadata.
About 50% of the studies shown data collected at multiple sites,
exploiting the feasibility of drone-based survey in requiring less effort in
the field and in covering large areas. In particular, Fallati et al. (2019)
surveyed three different island beaches in the Maldives, while Martin
et al. (2021) mapped 44 beaches on the Arabian coast. On the other
hand, Merlino et al. (2020) surveyed the litter abundance on the same
transect of 100 m monthly over a year, while Andriolo et al. (2020b)
surveyed 480 m to describe litter dynamics in response to tide, wind and
waves over the winter. These studies showed how drones can be used to
increase the number of surveys and to advance litter dynamic knowledge
on coastal areas.
All considered studies were performed on sandy coasts, with some
surveying also the environments landward of the beach (Gonçalves
et al., 2020b; Martin et al., 2018; Taddia et al., 2021), and proposing a
non-intrusive framework for litter mapping on dunes habitats (Andriolo
et al., 2021b, 2020a).
3. Analysis of drone-based litter survey assessments
Table 2 presents the type of image analysis (Stage 3, Fig. 1) and the
different outcomes (Stage 4, Fig. 1) of the 15 reviewed studies. When
litter was identified by the manual image screening (MS), six studies
compared the results of MS with a limited number of litter items
collected by traditional visual census (e.g., Escobar-S´anchez et al.
(2021)). Only two studies considered the whole beach litter bulk: Taddia
et al. (2021) focused on understanding the reliability of MS performed
by several operators, similarly to Lo et al. (2020) and Andriolo et al.
(2021a), while Fallati et al. (2019) aimed at fully evaluating the performances
of their automated machine learning classifier. Of interest,
citizen science programs may be beneficial for performing the MS task:
Papakonstantinou et al. (2021) proposed the MS to volunteers on an
online platform (e.g., https://www.zooniverse.org/), while Merlino
et al. (2021) made mapping litter items on images by school students.
A wide variety of techniques for automated litter detection on drone
images were also proposed, such as threshold-based (Bao et al., 2018),
pixel-based Random Forest machine learning (Gonçalves et al., 2020c,
2020b; Martin et al., 2021, 2018), object-based classifiers (Escobar-
S´anchez et al., 2021; Gonçalves et al., 2020a) and deep learning
(Papakonstantinou et al., 2021; Takaya et al., 2022). Other several
automated techniques have been developed over the last years (e.g.,
Pinto et al. (2021); Gnann et al. (2022) and references therein), however

these publications were excluded from this review, as they were exclusively
devoted to algorithms development, often with synthetic data.
All considered studies (Table 2) categorized the litter type and/or
material from images, except for Bao et al. (2018), Papakonstantinou
et al. (2021) and Takaya et al. (2022), which simply accounted for the
abundance of litter. Overall, the litter density on the area (item/m2) was
reported by most of the studies. More than 50% of the studies also reported
the total surface occupied by litter in terms of percentage or
actual area, since the size of items can be estimated through the manual
digitalization of objects contour (Merlino et al., 2020), applying image
segmentation (Andriolo et al., 2021b), or counting pixels in the detected
bounding boxes (Takaya et al., 2022).
A main advantage given by drones, in comparison with traditional
survey, is the possibility of generating the litter distribution map to, for
instance, relate spatial litter distribution to environmental forcing
(Andriolo et al., 2020b, 2020a; Gonçalves et al., 2020b), shoreline
orientation and marine traffic (Martin et al., 2021), along with locating
accumulation areas and hotspots (Andriolo et al., 2020a; Gonçalves
et al., 2020b). Given that the Digital Surface Model (DSM) can be
generated from drone images, Gonçalves et al. (2020c) also coupled
litter distribution to beach profile configuration, tide and wave runup
excursion on the beach, while Andriolo et al. (2020a) described the
likely litter path through dune blowouts. Of note that the use of DSM was
also proposed to help the operators in spotting litter items (Taddia et al.,
2021), and potentially can be adopted for estimating the volume of
litter, similarly to Kako et al. (2020).
4. Discussion on the potential standardization of drone-based
beach litter survey
The analysis of technical parameters adopted by the 15 studies
(Table 1) revealed that there is not a common protocol to deploy drones
in the field (Stage 2, Fig. 1), as the chosen flight altitudes was dependent
on the different objectives and fieldwork logistics. Yet, a wide variety of
automated techniques exists for processing images (Stage 3, Fig. 1),
however the 15 studies provided litter characteristics and distribution in
similar ways (Table 2), despite the different drone deployment parameters
adopted. In fact, drone images were suitable for the identification
of litter items even with the highest Ground Sampling Distance (GSD,
1.2 cm/px) registered (Andriolo et al., 2021b, 2020a).
Given the review and analysis provided in this work, it is of interest
to discuss a potential harmonization of beach litter surveys by drone.
Similarly as done for traditional census surveys by OSPAR and UNEP/
IOC (GESAMP, 2019; OSPAR Commission, 2010), the development of a
standardized protocol for drone litter data collection and/or analysis
would allow i) broad scale comparative studies, and ii) the estimation
and interpretation of results through long-term assessments. A potential
standardization would also promote litter mapping using data from researchers
and entities who collect drone images for different purposes on
coasts, such as beach-dune morphodynamics studies (Duo et al., 2021;
Fabbri et al., 2021), dunes flora and fauna census (Laporte-Fauret et al.,
2020), coastal cliff monitoring (G´omez-Guti´errez and Gonçalves, 2020;
Gonçalves et al., 2021), and coastal structure inspection (Gonçalves
et al., 2022).
Regarding the drone deployment in the field (Stage 2, Fig. 1), setting
a standardized flight altitude seems difficult, since the coastal environment
is highly variable worldwide: for instance, at the study sites on
Portuguese coast (Andriolo et al., 2020b; Gonçalves et al., 2020b), the
dune ridge raised up to 12 m, a lower flight altitude adopted by other
studies (e.g., 10 m) would not be possible. On other coasts, the presence
of trees, traffic lights and buildings, among other obstacles, would force
the choice of even higher flight altitude than 20 m.
A likely solution for standardized image products would be to set a
common Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) (Eq. (1)), as this would

permit to collect images with the same resolution worldwide, and thus
potentially promoting i) the development of universal algorithms for
automated litter detection and recognition, and ii) the proper training of
experts and citizen science operators (Merlino et al., 2021). However, a
common GSD would imply to adapt the flight altitude on drone model
and camera properties (Eq. (1) and Table 1). Even if, hypothetically,
researchers may have access to the same drone and camera model, it
must be contemplated that the flight height depends on the study site
characteristics, location and logistics, as mentioned above. Yet, standardizing
flight parameters for a lower GSD (higher resolution) may
force some researchers to limit the flight coverage due to the drone
battery autonomy, eventually losing important information about litter
distribution on wide beaches and dunes. On the other hand, proposing
standardized parameters for a higher GSD (lower resolution) would limit
the possibility of recognizing some type of items, and force to renounce
to the necessary details for replicating and/or replacing with drone the
100 m OSPAR survey (Escobar-S´anchez et al., 2021; Merlino et al.,
2020). Finally, low-cost drones, mounting less-performing cameras than
the ones adopted by the revised studies (Table 1), could be helpful for
increasing data collection on coasts, therefore lower flight altitudes will
be needed to provide reasonable and suitable GSD. Given all the above
observations, it seems difficult to propose a single standardized GSD
value adaptable worldwide. However, future work may investigate and
propose a suitable range of GSD, starting from the fact that GSD varied
between 0.01 and 1.2 cm/pixel in the reviewed studies.
From our point of view, a set of harmonized assessments and products
(Stage 4, Fig. 1) can instead be proposed to homogenize the insights
provided by drone-based litter survey (Fig. 3). A first standard product
may be the number of litter items encountered on images, which can be
used, for instance, to compute the clean-coast index (CCI, Alkalay et al.,
2007; Rangel-Buitrago et al., 2021), and/or evaluate the level of litter
contamination based on the threshold set by the Marine Strategy
Framework Directive (MSFD) of the European Commission (Werner
et al., 2020). Besides, coupling the litter map distribution to the beach
Digital Surface Model (DSM) would allow to understand how beach
configuration, along with wind and nearshore hydrodynamics, would
prevent and/or promote litter accumulation (e.g., Andriolo et al.
(2020b). These would be beneficial to provide quantitative data for
improving models of litter dynamics on coastal areas.
A second possible standard product may be the maps of single litter
type, source and/or material, to recognise how specific categories are
distributed on beaches and dunes (Fig. 3). These outcomes may be
exploited to understand which environmental force (tide, wave, current
and/or wind) played the main role in stranding and moving specific
items on the beach (Andriolo et al., 2020b), or identifying which type of
litter were trapped by different plants on dune environments (Andriolo
et al., 2021b). Finally, given the recent application of drone multispectral
images for automated litter material characterization (Gonçalves
and Andriolo, 2022), further works may outcome the distribution
of plastics on coasts (Fig. 3).
A third possible product may be the spatial distribution of litter items
based on their size (Fig. 3). Most of studies indicated the litter density in
terms of item/m2 (Table 2), however from such analysis two small
plastic caps, for instance, have the same statistical weight of two bottles
or two tyres. The map of size would describe instead the actual area
occupied by litter (Andriolo et al., 2020a; Bao et al., 2018; Merlino et al.,
2020; Taddia et al., 2021) and quantify hotspot accumulation. Beside
representing a scientific advantage in terms of litter survey, such map
could be coupled with the DSM for i) understanding the dynamics of
litter based on their size, in relation to beach and dune configuration
(Andriolo et al., 2021b), ii) estimating the total volume of litter (Kako
et al., 2020), and iii) improving clean-up operations.
The production of thematic grid maps can be easily implemented in a
GIS environment (Fig. 3): after having (manually or automatically)
marked and characterized the litter items on the orthophoto, the desired
category output can be selected and counted within the pre-created grid Table 2
Assessments of drone-based litter surveys. “Methods” refer to litter objects detection on images by manual image screening (MS) and/or automated algorithms. “Analysis” refers to examination of litter detection. “Litter

(Andriolo et al., 2020a; Gonçalves et al., 2020b).
The use of a grid is advantageous for numerous reasons. Firstly, the
grid map differs from a heatmap, as it does not require the setting of
neighbourhood radius and does not depend on data density. Secondly,
the grid map is independent on the orthophoto resolution (GSD),
therefore litter spatial abundance and distribution could be easily
compared among studies, regardless of drone models, flight parameters
and camera set up adopted (Table 1). Thirdly, the grid cell size can be
easily rescaled in GIS environment for different purposes, such as the
potential litter survey calibration and validation from satellites, whose
images have different resolution. Finally, grid maps could be shared
with local and national stakeholders such as authorities, nongovernmental
organizations and volunteers, for both raising awareness
on litter issue and optimizing clean-up operations (Battisti et al.,
2020).
Overall, the above proposal of harmonized assessments and products
(Stage 4, Figs. 1 and 3) does not fully solve the issue of comparing dronebased
surveys performed with likely different image resolution (Stage 2,
Fig. 1), which may determine different outcomes quality. Yet, implementing
manual image screening with different labelling strategies
(Stage 3, Fig. 1) may still produce incomparable data. In this regard,
adopting a common and simplified litter categorization shortlist
(Andriolo et al., 2021a) may help in producing normalized litter census
from images. Finally, suggesting a minimum value and/or an acceptable
threshold of F-score (Pinto et al., 2021) for automated techniques assessments
(Table 2) may be beneficial to guarantee a homogenized level
of accuracy.
To date, best practise guidelines to perform and complete the
different stages of the generalized workflow (Fig. 1) have not been
established yet. This work sets the ground to further discuss the development
of a standardized protocol for drone litter data collection and
analysis. The contribution of the research community is needed to
further improve the above observations and proposal.
5. Conclusions
This work analysed the 15 studies which used drones for beach
macro-litter surveys on an operational basis. Beach litter surveys by
drone have been performed on different coastal ecosystems in Europe
and Asia over the last four years. The analysis of technical parameters for
drone flight deployment revealed that flight altitude varied between 5
and 40 m, thus Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), expressing image
resolution, was between 0.01 and 1.2 cm/pixel. The analysis of final
assessments showed that, through manual and/or automated detection
of litter on images, most of studies provided litter bulk characteristics
(type, material and size), along with distribution maps. Therefore, the
use of drone for litter survey can be considered not only as an alternative
to the traditional visual census, but also as a new methodology to
advance knowledge on litter dynamics, potentially playing a major role
in providing data for litter models development on coasts through time.
Regarding the potential standardization of drone-based litter survey,
which would allow a comparison among surveys, the analysis revealed
difficulties in proposing a homogenized set of flight parameters, given
the wide variety of coastal environments, the different devices available,
and the likely diverse objectives of drone-based litter surveys. On the
other hand, in our view, a set of common outcomes can be proposed,
based on grid mapping, that can be easily generated following the
procedure indicated in this work.
This work is the first review on the use of drones for beach litter
survey. Overall, it sets the ground to further discuss the development of
a standardized protocol for drone litter data collection and analysis. The
protocol would support the provision of broad scale comparative
studies, allowing litter monitoring also through long-term assessments,
to support coastal management at both national and international
scales.
