Based on the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS2016)
data, this study empirically tests the impact of population
aging on household consumption. The results
show that population aging promotes the basic living
consumption expenditure of most households and
inhibits the enjoyment or development consumption
expenditure of most households. At the same time,
low-level consumer families are more affected by population
aging and income than high-level consumer
families. Moreover, the impact of population aging
on developmental consumption varies among families
with different income levels, especially in medical and
health expenditures. The higher the family income
level, the smaller the impact. Finally, this study puts
forward suggestions such as improving the social security
mechanism, improving the level of education,
releasing the consumption potential of the elderly, improving
the consumption level, and promoting consumption
upgrading.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
Consumption is the main driving force for sustained
economic growth. Encouraging and promoting residents’
consumption is an important measure to develop the “internal
circulation” of the economy. According to the data
from the National Bureau of Statistics, the Engel coefficient
of Chinese residents in 2017 was 29.3%, which
was lower than 30% for the first time, and entered the
rich range of 20%–30% as defined by the United Nations,
which was a decrease of 34.6% compared with
1978 (63.9%). The consumption structure of residents has
changed. Traditional basic living consumption has gradually
transitioned to enjoyment and development consumption.
Simultaneously, China’s population structure
is also changing. By 2020, China’s population aged 65
and above reached more than 190 million, accounting for
13.5% of the total population. Compared with the 7%
that officially entered the aging society in 2000, it has
increased by 6.5%, and China’s population aging rate is
evident. The age of consumers is a key factor in determining
the consumption structure (R. Mao and J. Xu [1]).
Thus the questions arise: “Is the change in consumption
structure related to the increasingly severe phenomenon of
population aging?,” “What impact will population aging
have on household consumption?,” and “Will population
aging promote the upgrading of household consumption
structures?” Under the current irreversible trend of population
aging, answering these questions will help provide
suggestions for improving and optimizing the household
consumption structure, thereby improving the level of residents’
consumption, which is of great practical significance
to promoting sustainable growth of China’s economy.
There is no consensus on the relationship between population
aging and consumption. It can be mainly divided
into the following categories: population aging is not
conducive to the improvement of residents’ consumption
rates (C.Wang and Y. Du [2]; H. Pan and J. Tang [3]), and
population aging has a positive effect on residents’ consumption
rate (X. Yi and Q. Jian [4]; Y. Huang et al. [5];
Y.Wang and H. Zhou [6]), the impact of population aging
on residents’ consumption is dynamic (Y. Aksoy et al. [7];
X. Zang and X. Li [8]; P. Liu et al. [9]; H. Jin and Y.
Li [10]), and the effect of population aging on residents’
consumption is not significant (W. Li et al. [11]; K. Li
et al. [12]). Some scholars study the influencing factors
of consumption. For example, X. Zhao and L. Li [13]
found that the education level of the household head and
the number of children in the family positively impact
consumption and significantly impact low-income households.
The age of the household head, the health status
of the household head, and the household size have a sig-

nificant impact on household consumption. F. Wang and
L. Huang [14] found that family characteristics are significantly
related to family consumption choices, and the
family characteristics possessed by residents have obvious
consumption preferences. L. Sheng et al. [15] found
that population aging negatively impacts average household
consumption, and urbanization and residents’ education
level significantly positively impact the average
household consumption rate.
Through the research literature, it can be found that
scholars have obtained many important and enlightening
conclusions based on the research of macro or micro data.
Few studies examine the internal changes in household
consumption structure at the micro level. The scant literature
focusing on this aspect mainly select provincial-level
data. Examining the impact of population aging on household
consumption from the micro level will help us grasp
the general direction of household consumption structure
changes and suggest improving consumption structure
and optimizing consumption upgrades. Thus, this study
analyzes the mechanism’s relationship between population
aging and consumption structure. Moreover, it conducts
an empirical test based on the data of China Family
Panel Studies (CFPS2016).
2. Analysis of Theoretical Mechanism
Due to differences in consumption quantity, consumption
habits, and consumption structure of different age
groups (R. Mao and J. Xu [1]), the impact of population
aging on household consumption can be summed up as
follows:
(1) Basic living expenses, which include food, clothing,
housing, and transportation expenses: The consumption
habits and consumption patterns of different age
groups are quite different. Accordingly, with the
population aging, the household consumption structure
will also change. In terms of food, on the one
hand, the elderly tend to have lighter tastes, which
reduces food consumption expenditure. On the other
hand, the elderly stay longer at home, hence the
number of meals at home also increases, which increases
food consumption. In terms of clothing, the
elderly prefer simplicity, and the elderly are retired
and unemployed at home, reducing the requirements
for dress. Therefore, as the population ages, clothing
consumption will gradually decrease. Regarding
housing, the elderly usually purchase a house
when they are young and middle-aged and generally
have to pay off their mortgage before retirement,
thus significantly reducing housing consumption. In
terms of transportation and communication, on the
one hand, the physical quality of the elderly declines
and the scope of activities is reduced; on the other
hand, after retirement, the social life circle becomes
narrower, so the consumption of transportation and
communication will also decrease.
(2) Cultural and educational entertainment: With the
continuous development of the social economy and
the continuous improvement of people’s living standards,
residents’ consumption has become more diversified.
Gradually, basic living consumption can
no longer meet people’s needs. People are beginning
to pursue high-quality lifestyles. Therefore, the
demand for cultural, educational, and entertainment
consumption gradually increases. The population’s
aging is intensifying. On the one hand, the elderly
are retired and unemployed at home, therefore, in
order to get rid of the state of doing nothing, they
generally enrich their elderly lives through activities,
such as reading, leisure, and vacation travel, which
improves the consumption of culture, education, and
entertainment. On the other hand, the consumption
habits of the elderly are more conservative and difficult
to change, and their social circle is narrow,
which reduces their consumption of entertainment
services related to social interaction. Therefore, the
impact of population aging on cultural, educational,
and entertainment consumption needs to be further
verified.
(3) Healthcare: With the population aging, the physical
conditions and physical functions of the elderly are
declining, and the demand for medical treatment, hygiene,
and health care increases. Therefore, population
aging will drive up healthcare consumption.
(4) Other consumption: Due to the strict implementation
of the family planning policy, more and more families
in our country have a “four-two-one” structure
(Y. Wang [16]). As a result, these families’ demand
for social elderly care services has increased. The
demand for social services, such as elderly family
nannies, elderly nursing services, and elderly housekeeping
services has gradually increased. It can be
observed that with the continuous aging of the age
structure of the population, the demand for elderly
services in the whole society will increase, and the
elderly health care industry, elderly mental health
counseling, and elderly home service industries related
to the elderly will increase rapidly. Therefore,
population aging will inevitably increase the demand
for the elderly service industry, and the proportion
of consumption for elderly services in household expenditure
will also increase.
Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the
following assumptions:
Hypothesis 1: Population aging reduces the consumption
expenditure of the entire society in
terms of clothing, food, housing, and
transportation. Population aging helps the
consumption structure to change from the
traditional survival type to the enjoyment
or development type consumption structure.

Influence of China’s Population Aging on Household Consumption
Hypothesis 2: Population aging increases the consumption
of health care in whole society,
and the impact of population aging on
culture, education, entertainment, transportation,
and communication consumption
has both positive and negative effects.
3. Model Establishment and Data Description
3.1. Model Establishment and Estimation Method
According to the above analysis and mechanism analysis,
we examine whether the aging of the population will
impact household consumption expenditure. First, is this
study consumption expenditure affected by the elderly?
Here, the dummy variable old of the elderly is set (the
family with the elderly is set to 1, and the family without
the elderly is set to 0), and the regression equation is as
follows:
ci = α0+α1oldi+δ Xi+εi . . . . . . . . (1)
where, ci represents the i-th family’s consumption details,
such as food, water and electricity, transportation, and education
expenses; X are other control variables, including
the sex of the head of the household, the highest education
level of the family, the health status of the head of
the household, the size of the family, and the household
registration, among others.
Second, in addition to the factors of population aging,
this study further analyzes other factors that affect
household consumption. While considering the differences
in the influencing factors of household consumption
at different consumption levels, this study uses quantile
and semi-parametric regression models for analysis. The
quantile model is represented as follows:
cq(xi) =βqaodi+φqzi +μi . . . . . . . . (2)
where, aod is the proportion of the family aged 65 and
above in the total family population, and z is the control
variable, including income, the highest education level of
the family, the health status of the head of household, and
family size, among others.
At this time βq is the “q-quantile regression coefficient,”
and the following minimization problem can be
defined by its estimator:
min
βq
n
Σ
i:yi≥x′iβq


+
n
Σ
i:yi<x′iβq
(1−q)

yi−x′iβq

(3)
If q = 1/2, then it is the median regression. At this
time, the objective function is simplified as follows:
min
βq
n
Σi

yi−x′iβq

. . . . . . . . . . . . (4)
Since the objective function of quantile regression contains
an absolute value and is not differentiable, it usually
calculates ˆβ
q by linear programming. It can be
proved that the sample quantile regression coefficient ˆβ
q
is a consistent estimator of the overall quantile regression
coefficient βq, and ˆβ
q obeys an asymptotic normal
distribution, that is: √n(ˆβ
q − βq) d −→ N(0,Avar(ˆβq)),
where, the asymptotic variance Avar(ˆβq) = A−1BA−1,
A ≡ plimn→∞ 1/nΣn
i=1 fuq (0|xi)xix′i, B ≡ plimn→∞ 1/n
Σn
i=1 q(1 − q)xix′i. fuq (0|xi) is the conditional density
function of the disturbance term uq ≡ y−x′βq at the value
of uq = 0.
The semi-parametric model can be expressed as:
yi = x′iβ +g(zi)+εi . . . . . . . . . . . (5)
among them, the parameter part x′iβ is a linear function,
and the non-parameter part g(zi) is an unknown function.
Assume that the mean value of the disturbance term εi is
independent of the xi and zi, that is E(εi|xi, zi) = 0. This
paper sets the family aging rate as a non-parametric factor.
Robinson proposed the “Robinson Difference Estimator”
to eliminate g(zi). Given zi, removing the conditional
expectations on both sides of the equation, we can get:
E(yi|zi) = E(xi|zi)′β +g(zi)+E(εi|zi) . . . (6)
According to the iterative expectation law, we can get:
E(εi|zi) = ExiE

(εi|zi)|xi

= ExiE(εi|xi, zi) =0 (7)
Subtract the two equations to get:
yi−E(yi|zi) =

xi−E(xi|zi)

′β +εi . . . . (8)
The unknown function g(zi) is eliminated in this difference
equation, and non-parametric methods can estimate
the conditional expectation E(yi|zi) and E(xi|zi).
Assuming that ˆE (yi|zi) and ˆE (xi|zi) are the
non-parametric estimates of the E(yi|zi) and E(xi|zi),
respectively, the following linear equations can be used
for OLS estimation:
yi− ˆE (yi|zi) =

xi− ˆE (xi|zi)

′β +μi. . . . . (9)
This estimator is denoted as ˆβ
PL because the conditional
expectation estimator is used to replace the conditional
expectation itself, so the disturbance term is no
longer εi and is recorded as μi.
Assuming εi compliance iid(0,σ2), one can prove:

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (10)
among them, wi ≡ xi −E(xi|zi). In the above formula,
as long as the substitution ˆE(xi|zi) is used to E(xi|zi),
the asymptotic covariance matrix var(ˆβPL) can be estimated.
If there is heteroscedasticity, the sandwich estimator
can be used to get a robust standard error. Finally, the
non-parametric estimate of the pair g(zi) can be obtained
as: ˆ g(zi) = ˆE(yi|zi)− ˆE (xi|zi)′ ˆβPL.
Finally, as income is the main reason for determining
consumption, the impact of population aging on consumption
upgrades is also different for families of differ-

ent income levels. Hence, by drawing on the definitions
of most studies, this study defines the sum of consumption
expenditures on health care, culture, education, entertainment,
and transportation and communication as developmental
consumption. It divides income into three
categories in ascending order, namely low-income (the
top 20%), middle-income (middle 60%), and high-income
(bottom 20%), based on a sample of low-, middle-, and
high-income households to analyze the impact of population
aging on household developmental consumption. The
econometric model representation is as follows:
cf i =α0+α1aodi +δ Xi+εi, . . . . . . . (11)
medf i =α0+α1aodi+δ Xi+εi, . . . . . . (12)
trcf i =α0+α1aodi+δ Xi+εi, . . . . . . (13)
eduf i =α0+α1aodi+δ Xi+εi. . . . . . . (14)
where cf, medf, trcf, and eduf represent consumption in
the areas of household development, medical, transportation
and communication, cultural, educational, and entertainment
consumption, respectively. Other control variables
represented by X, include the proportion of the juvenile
household population, income, household consumption
expenditure, the proportion of household children,
the urbanization rate, and the health status of the head of
the household, among others. Since the current medical
security in China is not perfect, the health status may significantly
affect the effect of population aging on household
consumption expenditure. Therefore, the interaction
term between population aging and health status is added
as a control variable.
3.2. Date Sources and Descriptive Statistics
The data used in this study were extracted from the
2016 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS2016) national
micro survey data. CFPS2016 surveyed 14019 households,
including 6917 urban households, 6682 rural
households, and 320 missing information. In this study,
the research mainly involves the content of household
consumption, household income, household assets, and
household demographic characteristics in the China Family
Panel Studies. The household demographic information
is represented by household head information.
As the head of the household is not clearly defined in
the China Family Panel Studies, this study refers to the
head of the household as the “financial respondent” in
the household questionnaire. For data processing, first,
match the data, take the family code (fid16) as the family
research object, and extract the household consumption,
household income, household assets, and other data of all
14019 households in the household table, and 36892 in
the household adult table. According to the family code,
the age, sex, education, and other data of 8427 children
in the adult and family children tables are matched and
combined into a new data table. The second is to delete
the data.
Delete the samples with null values for household income,
total household consumption expenditures, and

registration and samples with the highest academic qualifications
in the most recent survey as “unknown” or “not
applicable”; the 1%highest and lowest outliers in the consumption
data will be tailed off. Finally, a nationally representative
sample of 6587 households was obtained, including
3382 in urban and 3205 in rural areas. The descriptive
statistics of the variables are shown in Table 1.
Additionally, to avoid the regression coefficient being too
large or too small in the regression process, the logarithm
of the various household consumption expenditure
items, household consumption expenditure, household income,
cash and deposits, and commercial insurance costs,
among others are taken. Simultaneously, the above variables
are 0. The value variable is assigned the value 1,
and then the logarithm is taken.
4. Estimated Results and Analysis
4.1. Regression Benchmark
Tables 2 and 3 report the estimation results using the
ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regression
methods. This is because when the perturbations of the
equations in the seemingly unrelated regression model
satisfy Eεiε ′i = σ2
i I and Eεiε ′j = 0 (i = j), the estimated
results are the same as those of OLS (C. Hsiao [17]).
From the regression results in Tables 2 and 3, it can
be found that whether a family has an elderly person will
affect the family’s consumption, and there are significant
differences in the consumption of each item of this impact.
Next, we will analyze in detail the influence of the
elderly on the expenditures of household consumption
items. (1) Consumption items positively affected by the
elderly. The elderly persons have increased most families’
basic living consumption expenditures, such as food, water
and electricity, fuel, property, tourism, medical treatment,
and health care expenses. (2) Consumer items that
are negatively affected by the elderly. The elderly have reduced
most family enjoyment or developmental consump-

tion expenditures, such as eating out, post and telecommunications,
local transportation, buying cars, education
and training, beauty, and courtesy. (3) Consumption items
not significantly affected by the elderly. Whether elderly
people are in the home does not impact expenditures, such
as heating bills, housing maintenance, and social donations.
The above estimation results agree with our expected
hypothesis.
The above estimates agree with our expected assumptions
that the elderly increasemedical and health care consumption,
mainly due to, on the one hand, the gradual decline
in physical function and health level of the elderly
as their age increases; on the other hand, the elderly will
pay more attention to their health, so medical and health
care costs will inevitably increase. The elderly increase
tourismexpenditure. As children want to accompany their
parents more, family travel is a good way to accompany
parents and include fun in their later lives. The elderly
people reduce the expenditure on postal and telecommunications
services and local transportation. The reason
may be that after the elderly return to family life, they
have less time to socialize with others, thus reducing related
consumption. The elderly people reduce the consumption
of education and training because the young
and middle-aged will participate in some education and
training activities to improve their workability and work
experience. When people are approaching retirement or
have retired, their expectations for themselves are lower,
so they spend less on education and training.
4.2. Influence Factors of Different Levels of
Consumption
In this study, mean, quantile, and semi-parametric regressions
are carried out on household consumption expenditure.
The regression results are shown in Table 4.
From Table 4, we found that except for household registration,
the OLS estimates of the coefficient values of
other variables are all less than 0.5 of the median regression
estimate, indicating that the lower tail consumption
data weaken the effect of these variables on average
consumption. The semiparametric regression results
are close to OLS when only the aging rate is set
as a non-parameter factor. Next, we analyze the quantile
regression results and find that (1) the income coefficient
is positive in each quantile. With the increase
in income, household consumption also increases, which
agrees with the economic theory’s expectations. The income
elasticity of consumption increases with income.
(2) The impact of population aging on the consumption
of low-consumption households is greater than that

highest levels of education and health in the family have
a significantly greater impact on the consumption of
low- and middle-level income households than on the
consumption of high-income households. For low- and
middle-level consumer families, the higher the family education,
the stronger their ability to accept new things;
the decline in health status increases the demand for medical
and health care; and the family medical consumption
expenditure increases. (4) As household consump-

tion transitions from the low quantile to the high quantile,
the household size effect gradually decreases, and
the absolute impact of household population on consumption
becomes smaller and smaller. When the burden increases,
people will consider saving their expenses, while
the impact is negligible for high-consumption households.
(5) The influence of urban households on consumption
is positive, and the influence of household registration
on consumption is inversely related to consumption level,
and gradually decreases at the 0.1–0.9 percentile. (6) The
impact of cash deposits on consumption is negative. In
other words, cash deposits are savings. The corresponding
consumption decreases when a household’s savings
increase. The influence of cash deposits on consumption
in low- and medium-consumption households gradually
increases, while the influence of cash deposits on
high-consumption households is minimal.
4.3. Sample of Households with Different Incomes
According to the regression results in the previous
subsection, household consumption largely depends on
household income level. The regression results based on
three household samples of low, middle, and high income
are shown in Table 5.
From the regression results in Table 5, it can be found
that (1) population aging negatively impacts family developmental
consumption, which is inconsistent with the
research conclusion of W. Wang et al. [18]. The negative
impact of transportation, communication, cultural, educational,
and entertainment consumption is greater than the
positive impact of population aging on health care consumption.
Furthermore, the observation coefficient shows
that the higher the family’s income level, the less the negative
impact of population aging on its developmental consumption.
(2) Population aging has a significant positive
impact on health care consumption. Mainly, this is because
with the development of the social economy and
the improvement of medical and health technology, people
pay more attention to their physical health regardless
of their income level. Physical function is declining with
the aging of the elderly, and the demand for medical and
health care services is increasing. Therefore, the consumption
expenditure on health care increases. In addition,
the observation coefficient shows that the lower the
family’s income, the more significant the impact of population
aging. (3) The aging of low- and middle-income
families significantly negatively impacts transportation,
communication, cultural, educational, and entertainment
consumption. This result may be because, on the one
hand, the elderly people have retired and no longer work,
and their demand for continuing education or job training
and going out has dramatically reduced. On the other
hand, the elderly have changed from family savers to consumers;
thus, the burden of family support and the demand
for medical care will increase, which may have a

“squeeze effect” on transportation, communication, cultural,
educational, and entertainment consumption. The
negative impact on high-income families is insignificant
because the “squeeze effect” of high-income families is
not apparent.
5. Conclusion and Enlightenment
This study explores the mechanism and causes of the
impact of population aging on household consumption,
and uses the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS2016)
data as the research sample to conduct an empirical test.
The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Population aging
will impact household consumption expenditure. On
the one hand, population aging promotes the vast majority
of basic household consumption such as water and
electricity, fuel, heating, property, and housing maintenance
expenses. On the other hand, expenditure inhibits
most family enjoyment or development consumption expenditures,
such as dining out, transportation and communication,
local transportation, culture, education and
entertainment, purchasing cars, furniture, education and
training, and beauty. (2) Population aging, family income,
family’s highest educational level, and family size have a
more significant impact on low-level consumption than on
high-level consumption. (3) The impact of population aging
on developmental consumption varies across income
levels in families. Compared with high-income families,
population aging in low- and middle-income families has
a more significant impact on health care, transportation,
and communication, as well as cultural, educational, and
entertainment consumption.
Based on the above analysis, this study draws the following
inspirations. (1) The elderly significantly impact
household consumption. In order to encourage the elderly
to consume, it is important to improve the social security
mechanism, increase the pension income level of the elderly,
and develop and release the consumption potential
of the elderly. The development of the elderly industry
will improve the supply level of the elderly population industry,
create high-quality elderly care products and services
suitable for the elderly, and promote the upgrading
of the consumption structure. (2) The impact of the highest
family education level on consumption cannot be ignored
either. To improve the level of consumption, it is
important to promote consumption upgrade, adhere to the
priority development of education, and improve the education
level of residents. Increase financial investment
in education expenditure and increase investment in human
capital; improve the compulsory education system,
popularize high school education, increase the enrollment
rate of higher education, and increase the average number
of years of education for residents; strengthen general
education at the social level, and expand the knowledge
and skills of residents. Vision improves residents’
rapid access to information and processing capabilities,
enhances residents’ ability to accept and master new consumption
patterns, cultivates residents’ preferences for
development and enjoyment-oriented consumption, improves
consumption levels, and promotes consumption
upgrades.
