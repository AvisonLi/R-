With the rapid proliferation of e-retailing, the question of how e-shopping affects shopping travel
has attracted increasing attention since the beginning of this century. To date, however, scholars
have failed to reach a consensus on this topic. Meanwhile, China, where currently the highest
level of e-retail shopping in the world takes place, has not received the full focus of previous
studies. Using data from structured interviews with 710 respondents in Chengdu, China, we aim
to explore whether e-shopping for four types of goods (clothes and shoes, electronics, food and
drink, and cosmetics) replaces shopping trips. In addition, regression models are constructed to
demonstrate the determinants of e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors. The results suggest
that consumers’ e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors are significantly determined by sociodemographics,
internet experience, car ownership, and location factors. E-shopping has a
substitution effect on the frequency of shopping trips. It is further suggested that e-shopping
could be regarded as a possible solution for urban congestion. In the long run, the number of
physical stores for the four types of goods may decrease.
1. Introduction
In recent years, e-shopping has grown immensely in most parts of the world. The largest development in e-retailing has occurred
in China. In 2016, the market size of e-retailing was ¥ 2.6 trillion (≈US $ 0.41 trillion) in the United States, but online retail sales
approached ¥ 4.7 trillion (≈US $ 0.74 trillion) in China, nearly doubling the size of retail sales in the United States (IResearch,
2017a). In 2014, the online retail share of total retail sales in China (10.6%) overtook that in the United States (9.5%). To date,
China’s online retail market has become the largest in the world (McKinsey & Company, 2016).
With e-shopping growing rapidly, the impact of e-shopping on shopping travel has been the focus of many researchers, since it is a
topic related to urban land use and transportation systems (Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). To date, four types of impacts have
been proposed (Salomon, 1986; Mokhtarian, 2002; Ferrell, 2005; Cao, 2009; Clarke et al., 2015): (1) Substitution – shopping trips
are replaced by e-shopping; (2) Complementarity – due to e-shopping, the frequency of shopping trips increases; (3) Modification –
owing to e-shopping, trips to physical stores are not replaced but are altered; and (4) Neutrality – e-shopping has no effect on
shopping travel. Not surprisingly, previous empirical studies show conflicting results. Some scholars assert that people reduce their
shopping trips due to e-shopping, which indicates that e-shopping has a substitution effect on shopping trips (Gould & Golob, 1998;

Ferrell, 2005; Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007, 2009; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Irawan & Wirza,
2015). In contrast, other researchers argue that people frequently buying or searching online tend to make more shopping trips,
suggesting a complementarity effect (Farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; Cao, 2012; Cao et al., 2010, 2012; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen
et al., 2016; Ding & Lu, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Xi et al., 2018). In addition, some scholars also state that e-shopping alters the
shopping travel pattern (e.g., duration, distance), which supports the modification effect (Mokhtarian, 2002; Ferrell, 2005; Farag
et al., 2006a, 2007). However, a few studies have shown that e-shopping does not have a significant effect on shopping travel,
indicating a neutrality impact (Sim & Koi, 2002; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014).
As the country with the largest online retail sales in the world, China is a well-suited study area to investigate the effect of eshopping
on shopping travel. It is also reasonable to assume that some significant effects might be found. However, despite some
studies analyzing e-shopping in China (Zhen et al., 2016; Ding & Lu, 2017), the number of studies is rather low compared to other
countries such as the Netherlands (Farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007, 2009; Maat
& Konings, 2018) and the United States (Cao et al., 2010, 2012; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Lee et al., 2017). In addition, the impact of eshopping
on shopping travel among countries may differ considerably. For example, Sim and Koi (2002) attributed the neutral effect
of e-shopping on shopping travel to Singaporean’s preferences. In a Scottish study, Calderwood and Freathy (2014) claimed that
specific situational factors on islands can affect the relationship between e-shopping and shopping travel. It is acknowledged that as
an emerging economy, China has a development context that is quite different from other (Western) countries. Therefore, it is vital to
use evidence from China to clarify this rather controversial issue.
In addition, congestion is a challenge faced by most cities in the world today (Christidis & Rivas, 2012; Alam & Ahmed, 2013;
Chang et al., 2017). Especially in China, with highly rapid urbanization process, traffic congestion has become one of the biggest
challenges for many cities. Therefore, it is important to clarify whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips, which
determines whether shopping online is a solution or a new challenge for urban congestion. As a result, focusing on this topic can have
important implications for urban transportation systems (Cao, 2012; Crocco et al., 2013; Zhen et al., 2016).
In this context, it is the key objective of this paper to examine whether e-shopping replaces shopping trips with evidence from
China. Using data from structured interviews concerning e-shopping behavior in the Chinese city of Chengdu in 2016, we will attempt
to answer the following questions: Q1 – What are the determinants of e-shopping behavior? Q2 – Does e-shopping replace shopping
trips? If yes, Q3 – what are the determinants of whether people substitute e-shopping for shopping trips? The paper is organized as
follows. In the next section, previous research is reviewed and discussed. Section 3 presents the development context in China.
Section 4 contains the research design and methodology, while Section 5 presents the main results. Conclusions and a discussion are
offered in the last section.
2. Literature review
2.1. E-shopping versus shopping trips
The topic of this study, i.e., the effect of e-shopping on shopping travel, has been analyzed for quite a while. Before the widespread
use of e-shopping, a related topic, the effect of telecommunication on transportation, has attracted scholarly attention since the 1960s
(Memmott, 1963; Nilles et al., 1976; Salomon, 1985, 1986; Mokhtarian, 2002). At that time, the relationships between telecommunication
and transportation were in early stages. For example, substitution, complementarity, and neutrality had been raised
by theoretical frameworks. Subsequently, borrowing from these relationships, some scholars attempted to build a conceptual framework
to explain shopping behavior (Salomon, 1985, 1986; Mokhtarian, 2002). From this point on, this framework has been used
widely in empirical research to explore the association between e-shopping and shopping travel (Farag et al., 2006a, 2007;
Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007; Clarke et al., 2015). To date, a significant body of literature has investigated
the impacts of e-shopping on shopping travel. However, four types of effects are supported by substantial empirical evidence.
(1) Substitution. Gould and Golob (1998) were the first to analyze whether e-shopping will replace shopping trips using empirical
evidence. They believed that although a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips exists, its effect is negligible in the
United States. Subsequently, also using data from the United States, research by Ferrell (2005) indicated that respondents avoid
20% of a shopping trip for every 100 min they spend on e-shopping. Evidence from the Netherlands confirms this finding. For
instance, Weltevreden and Rietbergen (2007, 2009) found that more than 20% of respondents agreed that they reduce the
shopping trips to city center stores due to e-shopping. Weltevreden (2007) further noted that in the long run, physical stores for
some retail categories will be substituted by e-stores. Weltevreden and Rotem-Mindali (2009) also showed that e-shopping leads
to a net reduction in the amount of personal shopping trips. In addition, Irawan and Wirza (2015) similarly found in Indonesia
that e-shopping can decrease consumers’ willingness to conduct shopping trips.
(2) Complementarity. In a Dutch study, Farag et al. (2005, 2007) found that frequent online searchers are inclined to make more
shopping trips than infrequent online searchers. Farag et al. (2006a) further showed a complementary effect of e-shopping on
shopping trips, since results indicated that people who purchase online tend to buy at physical stores more frequently. Based on
shopping survey data in the United States, Cao et al. (2010) claimed that 49.3% of respondents were inclined to make a new trip
to physical stores after seeing goods online, which indicated that the shopping trip was encouraged by e-shopping. Cao et al.
(2012) also found that the frequency of e-shopping has a positive effect on the frequency of shopping trips. Cao (2012) further
showed that the generation effect of e-shopping on shopping trips will impose extra burdens on existing transportation systems.
Similarly, Zhou and Wang (2014) and Lee et al. (2017) also found a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and
K. Shi, et al. Transportation Research Part A 122 (2019) 21–33
22
shopping trips. In addition to the studies mentioned above, a limited number of studies from China have been published in recent
years. Using data from Nanjing, Zhen et al. (2016) and Xi et al. (2018) found a positive linkage between the frequency of buying
or searching online and the frequency of shopping trips. Applying a structural equation modeling approach to data from Beijing,
Ding and Lu (2017) claimed that e-shopping frequency has a positive association with the frequency of shopping trips to physical
stores.
(3) Neutrality. Mokhtarian (2002) noted that not every e-shopping activity will replace shopping trips; thus, its impact on shopping
travel could be overlooked. Using Singapore as the study area, Sim and Koi (2002) stated that the effect of e-shopping on
shopping travel is quite slim because Singaporeans prefer to purchase at physical stores rather than e-stores. Calderwood and
Freathy (2014) found that almost 80% of respondents indicated that the frequency of shopping trips was not affected by eshopping
in the Scottish Isles.
(4) Modification. Ferrell (2005) found that e-shoppers tend to take shorter-distance shopping trips in the United States. Similarly,
Farag et al. (2006a, 2007) showed that the more frequently people buy online in the Netherlands, the less time they spend on
shopping trips to physical stores.
From these previous studies, two main lessons can be learned. On the one hand, apart from a few cases, it is evident that eshopping
has an effect on shopping travel. However, it remains rather uncertain whether this is due to substitution or complementarity
effects. In this context, empirical evidence from an area with great e-shopping potential (e.g., China) can shed some new
light on this issue. On the other hand, scholars largely ignored the shopping travel implications of China’s large e-retailing market
before 2016. Since then, only a few studies have begun to reveal this topic using evidence from China (e.g., Zhen et al., 2016; Ding &
Lu, 2017; Xi et al., 2018).
Furthermore, some existing studies do not seem to be able to determine whether e-shopping generates shopping trips. Some
scholars found a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips and consequently claimed that there
exists a complementary effect of e-shopping on shopping trips (e.g., Farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al.,
2016; Ding & Lu, 2017). However, evidence is limited because, for example, most e-shoppers are likely to decrease their frequency of
shopping trips due to e-shopping. Frequent e-shoppers, however, still make more shopping trips than infrequent e-shoppers, as they
have a higher shopping demand. In this case, the frequency of shopping trips is not encouraged by e-shopping, and a positive
association does not indicate complementarity but indicates substitution. Meanwhile, when respondents were asked whether they
changed the frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping, they mostly indicated a reduction in frequency (e.g., Weltevreden, 2007;
Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014). Compared to the former case,
it is more reasonable to explore the issue in the latter case.
Three studies focusing on China indicate a complementary effect of e-shopping on the frequency of shopping trips because a
positive association between e-shopping or online searching and shopping trip frequency was found (Zhen et al., 2016; Ding & Lu,
2017, Xi et al., 2018). However, their findings seem untenable. Previous studies suggest that the effect of e-shopping on shopping
trips to stores is associated with whether these stores will be eliminated (Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2009; Cao
et al., 2013). In other words, assuming that e-shopping stimulates consumers to make more shopping trips to physical stores, new
physical stores might emerge. In this case, the demand for land by the retail industry is more likely to be extended to a certain extent.
However, Zhang et al. (2016) found that the demand for retail real estate is inhibited by e-commerce in China, which is irreconcilable
with the findings of Zhen et al. (2016), Ding and Lu (2017) and Xi et al. (2018).
2.2. E-shopping determinants
To date, many studies have investigated the factors affecting e-shopping behavior. Sociodemographic factors have been tested
frequently in previous studies. First, gender is found to affect e-shopping behavior, but conflicting results have been presented. In
some studies, women are more likely to adopt e-shopping than men (Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). However, some
opposite findings have shown that men are more inclined to purchase online (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Crocco et al., 2013). In
addition, Zhen et al. (2016) stated that men are more likely to conduct e-shopping for electronics than women, but women are more
likely to shop online for clothes and daily goods than men. Lee et al. (2015), on the other hand, found that gender has no significant
effect on e-shopping behavior. Second, some researchers stated that age negatively influences e-shopping behavior (Farag et al.,
2007; Crocco et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Irawan & Wirza, 2015; Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). However, a
nonlinear relationship between age and e-shopping behavior was found by Farag et al. (2006b) and Zhen et al. (2018). They found
that up to the age of 33 years old, the probability of purchasing online rises with increasing age. After 33 years old, the probability of
purchasing online starts to decline. Third, a positive influence of income on e-shopping behavior was found by a considerable number
of studies (Farag et al., 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012, 2013; Crocco et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al., 2016, 2018).
However, Farag et al. (2006b) and Ding and Lu (2017) found an insignificant effect concerning income. Irawan and Wirza (2015)
even stated that low-income groups tend to purchase online more frequently. Fourth, it has been suggested that people with higher
education levels are more inclined to engage in e-shopping (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012; Zhou & Wang,
2014; Zhen et al., 2018), although Ding and Lu (2017) argued that education does not matter for e-shopping behavior. Irawan and
Wirza (2015) even held a contrary opinion that people who are more educated are unlikely to purchase online.
Individual internet experiences have also been tested in previous studies. It has been indicated that the frequency of internet use
positively affects e-shopping behavior (Ding & Lu, 2017; Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Cao et al., 2013; Maat & Konings, 2018). Furthermore,
studies by Farag et al. (2007) and Ren and Kwan (2009) showed that the number of years using the internet positively
K. Shi, et al. Transportation Research Part A 122 (2019) 21–33
23
affects e-shopping behavior. Similarly, Irawan and Wirza (2015) stated that using the internet on a weekly base has a positive effect
on e-shopping. With the widespread use of smartphones, e-shopping on smartphones has become common behavior. Maat and
Konings (2018) stated that people who have a smartphone conduct e-shopping more frequently.
Car ownership is also expected to influence an individual’s e-shopping behavior. A study by Irawan and Wirza (2015) indicated
that both the number of vehicles that households own and the number of family members having a driver’s license positively affect eshopping
frequency in Indonesia. Similarly, Zhen et al. (2016) found that people possessing a driver’s license are more inclined to
purchase online for clothes, electronics, books, and daily goods in Nanjing, China. In contrast, Farag et al. (2006a) claimed that car
ownership has an insignificant effect on the adoption of e-shopping in the United States. Notably, ignoring car ownership, Zhen et al.
(2016) explored only the effect of driver’s license possession on e-shopping behavior in China. Given the conflicting results in
previous studies, it remains unclear how car ownership influences e-shopping behavior in China.
Geographers have paid much attention to the effect of location factors on e-shopping behavior. At the beginning of the 2000s, two
plausible hypotheses were proposed (Anderson et al., 2003; Boschma and Weltevreden, 2004; Farag et al., 2006b). One is the
innovation diffusion hypothesis, stating that urban residents are most likely to adopt e-shopping, as they are better educated and
more likely to actively use the internet for other purposes. The other is the efficiency hypothesis, which postulates that people in
nonmetropolitan or suburban areas are more likely to adopt e-shopping, since they can benefit more from online shopping as a
consequence of lower accessibility to stores. The two hypotheses have subsequently been tested by empirical evidence. Farag et al.
(2005, 2007) stated that people living in more urbanized areas are inclined to purchase online, which tends to support the innovation
diffusion hypothesis. Similarly, Cao et al. (2013) and Zhou and Wang (2014) found that people living in urban areas engage in more
frequent e-shopping. On the other hand, Krizek et al. (2005) showed that – in metropolitan areas – people living in the suburbs or
further from the city center purchase more frequently online, which seems to confirm the efficiency hypothesis. Given that shopping
trips are usually chained with trips for other purposes, especially commuting trips (Salomon, 1986; Ferrell, 2005; Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013), the effect of work location on e-shopping has also been tested (Zhen et al., 2018). The results indicate that
people living and working in urban areas are more likely to purchase books online. Surprisingly, McHugh (2014) found that location
factors have no significant effect on e-shopping behavior.
Except for the above factors examined most frequently in previous studies, other factors are also expected to determine eshopping
behavior. For example, some studies have shown that the type of work can play a key role in e-shopping behavior (Ren &
Kwan, 2009; Cao et al., 2013; Irawan & Wirza, 2015). The effect of attitudes towards e-shopping or in-store shopping on e-shopping
behavior has also been discussed in other studies (Cao et al., 2010, 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Irawan & Wirza, 2015).
Although a significant body of research has explored e-shopping determinants, very few studies have investigated the determinants
of whether people increase or decrease shopping trip frequency due to e-shopping. Weltevreden & Rietbergen (2009) examined
this question and determined some interesting findings: (1) For nondaily goods, people who frequently purchase online, have low
accessibility to shops by car, enjoy in-store shopping to a limited degree, or are relatively young are more likely to substitute eshopping
for shopping trips. However, gender and education do not seem to play a significant role. (2) For specialty goods, people
who purchase online frequently, search online frequently, have low accessibility to shops by car, have less enjoyment for in-store
shopping, or are male tend to substitute e-shopping for shopping trips. Age has a nonlinear effect on the probability of making fewer
shopping trips.
Overall, there have been conflicting results concerning e-shopping determinants. For example, gender, age, and location seem to
play different roles in e-shopping among existing studies. It is reasonable to assume that we can attribute these conflicting outcomes
not only to research limitations (e.g., methodology, definition of e-shopping, quality of data) but also to local contexts of study areas
(e.g., economic development, urbanization, informatization, social culture). Hence, the determinants of e-shopping should be explored
in various regions.
3. Development contexts in China
As an emerging economy, China has a special context that is different from other (Western) countries. Considering that local
contexts have a profound effect on e-shopping behavior (e.g., Sim & Koi, 2002; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014), it is necessary to
present the development contexts in China, which may contribute to the understanding of the following analysis results.
In recent years, China has enjoyed a rapid urbanization. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2016a) indicated
that the urbanization rate (percentage of people living in urban areas) in China increased to 56% in 2015 from 38% in 2001. It was
reported by the Chengdu Municipal Commission of Economy and Information Technology (2017) that the total population reached
15.9 million with an urbanization rate of 70.6% in 2016 in Chengdu. Consequently, the considerable transport congestion is mainly
caused by rapid urbanization and a very high population density in Chengdu and other Chinese large cities. Additionally, compared
to most Western countries, China has a relatively low rate of car ownership (Zhen et al., 2016, 2018). Therefore, it may not be
convenient for many urban residents in China to make shopping trips by private cars. In this context, the residents’ desire for
shopping trips may be reduced because e-shopping has become a viable alternative.
In addition, with the booming growth of the e-retailing market, the demand for delivery service has increased dramatically. It was
reported by the State Post Bureau of China (2016) that the number of fast deliveries, which are mainly used for e-shopping, reached
20.67 billion in 2015, representing a 48% increase from 2014. Furthermore, the revenue from fast deliveries was 276.96 billion Yuan
(≈US $ 43.90 billion) in 2015, representing a 35% increase from 2014. Consequently, delivery companies have emerged rapidly in
China. In recent years, some have become listed companies, such as Shunfeng Co. Ltd., Yuantong Co. Ltd., and Shentong Co. Ltd.
Thus, unlike most Western countries, delivery service stations are distributed densely from cities to villages in China, partially
K. Shi, et al. Transportation Research Part A 122 (2019) 21–33
24
because these companies offer fast delivery services at a relatively low price. Usually, consumers living in large cities can receive
goods on the day or the day after they order online. Consumers living in other areas can always receive goods within seven days.
Thus, high-quality delivery services may attract people to adopt e-shopping, which is one of the main reasons why the largest online
retail development has occurred in China.
China also has particular experience in terms of retail development. Before e-shopping emerged, purchasing by telephone or mail
was popular in most Western countries. Hence, some scholars postulated that people might substitute e-shopping for buying by
telephone or mail but not for shopping trips (Salomon, 1985; Keskinen et al., 2001; Mokhtarian, 2004; Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013). However, unlike Western countries, telephone and internet were not used frequently in China before the 1990s.
Consequently, the retail marketing by telephone and mail was not fully mature before e-shopping emerged. Therefore, in China, it
seems that people might substitute e-shopping for shopping trips but not for buying by telephone or mail.
4. Methodology
4.1. Data collection
4.1.1. Study area and dataset
Data from this research is drawn from structured interviews conducted in July and August 2016 in Chengdu, China. Chengdu, the
capital of Sichuan Province, is located in southwest China (see Fig. 1). In 2016, Chengdu was listed as one of eight National Central
Cities by the National Development and Reform Commission of China (2016). The National Bureau of Statistics of China (2016b)
reported that in Chengdu, the number of internet service subscribers was 4.74 million households in 2015 and total retail sales of
consumer goods reached ¥ 494.62 billion (≈US $ 78.03 billion). Apparently, Chengdu has enjoyed rapid urbanization and informatization
and has had a significant body of demand for retail, suggesting an enormous potential for e-shopping. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that Chengdu is a good and representative case city for this study.
A cluster sampling approach was used to select neighborhoods and respondents in five steps. First, we defined the target population
as people who have used e-shopping at least once in their life, i.e., e-shoppers (partly because people who had never
purchased online in Chengdu turned out very hard to find when conducting a preliminary survey). Second, we determined the desired
sample size (approximately 600–1000 respondents) which would make it possible to conduct regression analyses with ample confidence.
Third, the sampled area was defined as the built-up area within the Third Ring Road of Chengdu (see Fig. 1), where most of
Chengdu’s residents live. Fourth, the number of the sampled neighborhoods was determined (10 sampled neighborhoods). Fifth,
among the public spaces (which were open and accessible for every resident), we geographically randomly selected 10 sampled
neighborhoods (within the sampled area), in which the structured interviews were performed: Chunxilu Shopping Center, Jinniu-
Wanda Shopping Center, Laifushi Shopping Center, Hongpailou Shopping Center, Kaide Shopping Center, Tianfu Square, Shahe Park,
Huanhuaxi Park, Tazishan Park, and Dongjiaojiyi Music Park (see Fig. 1).
To minimize selection bias, we made some efforts. On the one hand, our interviews were conducted after people finished work on
weekdays and during the entire day on weekends. On the other hand, a set of postcards marked with the Lanzhou University logo was
provided as an incentive after the respondent finished the survey. In the end, 1796 people were approached to participate in the
survey, and 882 accepted our invitation. The response rate was 49.1%. The group of people who did not participate in this survey
were those who indicated being in a rush or not being interested or people who had never adopted e-shopping. After removal of some
questionnaires missing key responses, 710 valid samples were collected.
As shown in Table 1, 51.1% of the respondents are men, and 58.5% of them are younger than 26. According to a report by the
China Electronic Commerce Research Center (2016), 47.4% of e-shoppers in China are men, and 51.2% of them are younger than 27.
Based on this rudimentary comparison (due to a lack of additional information on Chinese e-shoppers), our respondents seem rather
representative of China’s e-shoppers. However, conducting the survey in public spaces might result in a certain level of selection bias.
First, at these locations (but also at other places in China), older people are less inclined to participate in surveys. However, because
these people often do not purchase goods online, this was not a major problem for this study. Consequently, our respondents are
relatively young (but not considerably younger than the total population of Chinese e-shoppers). Second, people who lived in the
sampled area but do not regularly visit these public spaces were ignored.
The dataset consists of five categories of information. The first category includes individual sociodemographic information, such
as age, gender, and educational background. The second category is information about internet experience and car ownership. The
third category is the departure place from which the respondent mostly makes a shopping trip. The fourth category is the frequency of
e-shopping and shopping trips to physical stores. Considering that the frequency of e-shopping might vary among types of goods
(Weltevreden, 2007; Zhen et al., 2016, 2018), we selected four types of goods that are purchased online most frequently in China:
clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics. The respondents were asked to provide the monthly frequency of eshopping
for four types of goods (see Table 2) and to provide the monthly frequency of shopping trips to physical stores for these
goods (both for a “regular month”). Based on the methodologies of previous studies (Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen,

trips and total shopping1 owing to e-shopping. The respondents were asked to answer two questions: After adopting e-shopping for
the four types of goods, (1) do you change your frequency of shopping trips to physical stores? (2) do you change your frequency of

total shopping? The alternative answers to the two questions were set on a 5-point scale: decreased substantially, decreased somewhat,
no change, increased somewhat, and increased substantially.
4.1.2. Dependent variable
In this study, we used two dependent variable categories:
(1) The frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips for four types of goods are extracted as the data source of the dependent variable.
First, we sum the frequency of e-shopping for four types of goods, representing the frequency of e-shopping (see Table 1). Second,
the frequency of shopping trips to physical stores for these goods is used to reflect the frequency of shopping trips. Third, as
performed by Maat and Konings (2018), we calculate the share of e-shopping frequency in total shopping frequency to indicate
the probability that the respondents adopt e-shopping when having a shopping demand.
(2) As mentioned earlier, the determinants of whether to decrease or increase the frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping have
not been explored properly before. This study will attempt to fill this research gap. To do so, we analyze whether e-shopping
replaces or generates shopping trips as a dependent variable.
4.1.3. Explanatory variable
Based on the literature review above, we identify several explanatory variable categories (sociodemographics, internet experience,
car ownership, and spatial attributes) as reported in Table 3. Given a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trip frequency,
Weltevreden and Rietbergen (2007, 2009) found that people frequently purchasing online have a higher probability of
reducing their shopping trips. Since it is currently unclear whether this effect can also be found in China, the frequency of e-shopping
is added as the explanatory variable of whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips.
Additionally, home location is expected to be an explanatory variable of e-shopping behavior in previous studies, since it determines
the accessibility to physical stores (Farag et al., 2005, 2007; Cao et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014). However, some scholars
have argued that the residential location may not indicate accessibility because shopping trips are usually chained with other trips,
especially commuting trips (Salomon, 1986; Ferrell, 2005; Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). In other words, assuming that
someone lives in a weakly urbanized area but works in a strongly urbanized area, he/she usually departs for a shopping trip from a
work location. In this case, he/she has a high accessibility to physical stores even though he/she lives in a weakly urbanized area.
Therefore, the accessibility to physical stores is not determined by residential location but by the departure location for a shopping
trip. Using the residential location as the explanatory variable has its shortcomings. Although Zhen et al. (2018) made an effort to
consider both home location and work location as the spatial variable, it is still not the best solution to make up for this shortcoming.
Hence, we regard the departure location where the respondent mostly makes a shopping trip as the independent variable representing
the location factor. Chengdu is a city with a high urbanization level that continuously decreases from city center to city periphery. In
this context, we define the area within the Third Ring Road as the urban area, the area between the Third Ring Road and the Fourth
Ring Road as the suburban area, and the area outside the Fourth Ring Road as the exurban area (see Fig. 1).

4.2. Modeling approach
In this study, we develop three types of regression models. First, given that the frequency of e-shopping and the frequency of
shopping trips are two sets of count variables, both Poisson and negative binomial regression models can be adopted. However, the
means of two sets of count variables are both smaller than their variances,2 which does not support the requirement of the Poisson
regression model that the mean of the dependent variable is roughly equal to its variance. Negative binomial regression models are
therefore employed to investigate the determinants of e-shopping and shopping trip frequency. Second, considering that the share of
e-shopping is a continuous variable and largely follows a normal distribution,3 we develop a linear regression model to identify the
determinants of the share of e-shopping. Third, we further develop a binomial logistic regression model to search for the determinants
of whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips, which is a set of binary variables.
5. Results
5.1. Determinants of e-shopping frequency, shopping trip frequency, and share of e-shopping
As reported in Tables 4 and 5, sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership and spatial attributes are found to significantly
affect e-shopping frequency, shopping trip frequency, and share of e-shopping.
The results indicate that women are more likely to purchase online frequently, which is consistent with the findings of several
previous studies (e.g., Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). Additionally, women also make more shopping trips and have a
higher share of e-shopping. This finding is in line with the Chinese study of Ding and Lu (2017), suggesting that women are,
compared to men, more likely to purchase both online and in-store. Zhen et al. (2016) found that shopping responsibility is largely
determined by gender. In China, women usually bear more shopping responsibility for families than men, probably resulting in a
higher shopping demand.
We found that older respondents are also more likely to purchase online frequently. This result seems to contradict with many
previous studies (Farag et al., 2007; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Irawan & Wirza, 2015; Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). However,
this result is not that surprising, since our respondents are relatively young. To a large extent, our findings are consistent with the
findings of Farag et al. (2006b) and Zhen et al. (2018), claiming that for respondents younger than 34, age has a positive effect on eshopping
frequency. Similarly, older people tend to make more shopping trips probably because shopping responsibilities for families
grow with increasing age. People with higher education are more likely to purchase online frequently, which supports many previous
studies (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al., 2018). Additionally, people with a
higher educational background are also inclined to make more shopping trips, which is consistent with the finding of Farag et al.
(2005).
Income is negatively associated with the frequency of both e-shopping and shopping trips, possibly because people with higher
incomes have more time pressure and a higher value of time, resulting in a lower demand for both e-shopping and in-store shopping.
Although quite a number of researchers found that higher-income respondents are more likely to purchase online frequently (e.g.,
Farag et al., 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012, 2013, Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al., 2016, 2018), it seems that respondents with
lower incomes can benefit more from purchasing online. It is an important asset for e-retailers that, using the same amount of money
as before, consumers can purchase more goods online since the goods are provided at a lower price by e-retailers (Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013). Hence, purchasing online is a good strategy for consumers to save money, resulting in high levels of e-shopping
for people who have low income levels. In addition, people who have a higher income may pay more attention to the quality of goods
than price. Thus, they are less likely to purchase online, as the quality of online goods is relatively low in China (Ding & Lu, 2017). We
also found that people with a high cost of living are more likely to conduct both e-shopping and shopping trips frequently, which can
be largely explained by their higher shopping demand.
However, our results show that people with considerable experience using internet on PCs have a lower interest in e-shopping,
which is inconsistent with most existing research (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Farag et al., 2007; Ren & Kwan, 2009; Cao et al., 2013;
Irawan & Wirza, 2015; Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). This finding may be attributed to the new context of the information
era in China. It has been reported that 55.5% of Chinese e-retailing sales in 2015 were conducted by mobile terminals, such as
smartphones and iPads (IResearch, 2017b). The possible reasons why people transfer e-shopping partially to mobile devices instead
of a personal computer (PC) in China are as follows. On the one hand, compared to PCs, mobile devices have unique advantages, such
as ubiquity, convenience, localization, and personalization (Groß, 2015). On the other hand, some apps installed on mobile terminals
for payment are very popular in China, such as Alipay, WeChat payment. Therefore, with the widespread use of smartphones, the use
of PCs is no longer necessary for e-shopping and can even be regarded as burdensome. Moreover, people who have a long history of
using PCs may have developed risk awareness. Some studies have indicated that risk aversion has a negative effect on e-shopping
(Park and Kim, 2003; Al-Debei et al., 2015). Thus, they may tend to partake in less e-shopping. Although Ding and Lu (2017) found
that the duration of internet use has a significant positive effect on online shopping in China, the data in their study were collected in
2012, when only 5.8% of e-retailing sales were conducted by mobile devices (IResearch, 2017b).
2 The means of e-shopping and shopping trip frequency are 8.50 and 7.40, and the variances are 68.76 and 43.17, respectively.
3 The skewness and kurtosis of e-shopping shares are 0.60 and 0.15, respectively (smaller than 1), indicating that the set of variables largely
follows the normal distribution.

Moreover, people owning a car tend to conduct fewer shopping trips, which is in line with the finding of Farag et al. (2007),
possibly because they can transport more goods by car at a time. On the other hand, traffic congestion at shopping centers may also
inhibit them from driving a car to go shopping.
In addition, location plays a key role in e-shopping behavior. The results indicate that people who mostly start their shopping trips
from urban areas are more likely to purchase online frequently. Furthermore, people who mostly start their shopping trips from urban
areas or exurban areas are inclined to have a higher e-shopping share compared to respondents departing from suburban areas. Since
the individual factors (e.g., age, education, income, internet experience) are controlled for in the model, the built environment seems
to have a significant effect on e-shopping share. For people departing from urban areas, higher accessibility to physical stores might
result in a higher interest in e-shopping. For example, it is more convenient for them to visit a physical store to ensure the quality of
goods before shopping online, which could stimulate them to conduct more e-shopping because of lower prices of online goods

(Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). This result seems consistent with the innovation diffusion hypothesis (Anderson et al., 2003)
and roughly confirms the findings of some studies on e-shopping (Farag et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014). For people
departing from exurban areas, it is more convenient to conduct e-shopping compared to shopping trips because of lower accessibility
to physical stores. This result is in line with the findings of Ren and Kwan (2009) and provides empirical evidence to loosely support
the efficiency hypothesis. However, compared to urban areas, people who mostly start a shopping trip from suburban areas find it less
convenient to visit a physical store before e-shopping. Respondents starting their trips from suburban areas also benefit less from
online shopping because of higher accessibility to physical stores compared to exurban areas. Both explanations might partly explain
the finding that people departing in suburban areas are less likely to conduct e-shopping.
Interestingly, some factors play similar roles in both e-shopping and shopping trip frequency. For instance, women, or people who
are older, better educated, with a lower income, or with a higher cost of living tend to conduct both e-shopping and shopping trips
frequently. This finding is probably attributed to their higher shopping demand.
5.2. The effect of e-shopping on shopping trip frequency
In this section, we aim to explore the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips by analyzing change in the frequency of shopping trips
owing to e-shopping. As shown in Table 6, more than 44% of the respondents indicate that they make fewer shopping trips due to eshopping,
although 14.9% of the respondents say that they increase shopping trip frequency. As a result, it can be suggested that in
most cases, e-shopping has a substitution effect on shopping trips, which is consistent with some previous studies (Ferrell, 2005;
Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007, 2009; Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Irawan & Wirza, 2015). We can
attribute this finding to China’s emerging contexts mentioned above: urban traffic congestion, relatively low rate of car ownership,
and developed e-retailing and (fast) delivery service.
5.3. The effect of e-shopping on total shopping frequency
Interestingly, we also find that more than 70% of the respondents indicate that e-shopping makes them increase the frequency of
total shopping, i.e., conventional shopping and e-shopping combined (see Table 7). That is, e-shopping has a promotion effect on the
shopping demand. Three reasons may lead to this result. First, it is widely acknowledged that saving time is one of the most important
motivations for e-shopping (Farag et al., 2006a, 2007). Hence, the time saved by e-shopping may be exploited by consumers to
conduct more shopping. Second, compared to conventional channels, e-commerce provides more convenience to consumers to acquire
goods information, which may seduce consumers to have more desire for shopping (Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2004; Cao,
2012). Third, the goods are usually sold with a lower price on the e-retail website. Thus, using the same amount of money as before,
the consumer can buy more goods online (Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). It should be noted that, the finding that e-shopping
partially replaces shopping trips but also generates more shopping in total is not necessarily conflicting.
5.4. Determinants of whether e-shopping replaces shopping trips
Given a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips, we aim to explore the determinants of whether respondents substitute
e-shopping for shopping trips by using a binomial logistic regression model in this section. As shown in Table 8, People who do not
own a private car tend to reduce their shopping trips. Usually, they use public transport for shopping trips and thus must spend more

time on a shopping trip than those who drive to shops. Hence, compared to in-store shopping, purchasing online becomes a better
way for them to save time, resulting in the substitution of shopping trips. The outcome also indicates that, due to e-shopping, people
who purchase online frequently are less likely to reduce shopping trip frequency. Although this result is inconsistent with the finding
of Weltevreden and Rietbergen (2007, 2009), it could be explained as follows. As observed before, people who purchase online more
frequently seem to have a higher shopping demand, which may make them have less likelihood to reduce their shopping trips. In
addition, no significant associations between other factors (e.g., sociodemographics, internet experience, or spatial attributes) and
substitution of e-shopping for shopping trips are found.
6. Conclusion and discussion
Using data from 710 structured interviews in 2016 in Chengdu, China, we aim to examine whether e-shopping for four types of
goods (clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics) replaces shopping trips. This paper made the following contributions.
First, we investigated the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips with evidence from China, where the largest amount of eretailing
in the world takes place, as China was largely ignored by previous studies. Second, we identified the determinants of
whether people substitute e-shopping for shopping trips, which is an important gap in previous studies. Third, we redefined the
“location” as where people mostly start their shopping trips, which is different from that in previous studies. The new definition of

“location” in this study may be regarded as an improvement compared to previous studies, since shopping trips are mostly chained
with other trips.
In sum, our results indicate that sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership, and location factors (partially) affect
consumers’ e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors. In particular, with regard to location, two approaches measuring e-shopping
lead to different results. People who mostly start their shopping trips from urban areas are likely to purchase online more frequently.
However, people who mostly start their shopping trips from urban or exurban areas are likely to have a higher e-shopping share.
Roughly speaking, we find empirical evidence from China to support both the innovation diffusion hypothesis and efficiency diffusion.
Moreover, the results also suggest that more than 44% of the respondents tend to reduce their shopping trips due to eshopping,
although a limited number of respondents (14.9%) indicate the opposite. Hence, by and large, e-shopping has a substitution
effect on the frequency of shopping trips in China. Meanwhile, more than 70% of the respondents indicate that e-shopping
increases the frequency of total shopping, suggesting that their shopping demands are generated by e-shopping. Furthermore, people
who own a car, or purchase online more frequently are less likely to substitute e-shopping for shopping trips.
Given the finding that e-shopping has a substitution effect on the shopping trips to physical stores, these stores may experience a
loss of consumers. In this case, it is reasonable to believe that in the long run, physical stores for clothes and shoes, electronics, food
and drink, and cosmetics will reduce in number. Our conclusion is directly or indirectly supported by some previous publications. For
example, IResearch (2017a) reported that the sale size of grocery stores and large markets declined 10.4% and 0.2%, respectively, in
Chinese cities from 2013 to 2015. Zhang et al. (2016) also found that the extension of urban commercial land is inhibited by ecommerce.
Although the continuous growth of shopping demands in China may offset the negative effect of e-shopping on physical
stores, a loss of revenue for conventional stores still exists owing to such a large size and dramatic-rapid growth rate of e-shopping
market in China.
Our results have two implications for transportation systems. On the one hand, e-shopping might be a possible solution for urban
congestion because a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips is found. On the other hand, people who do not have a
private car normally make a shopping trip to stores on foot or by public transportation. Meanwhile, our results indicate that,
compared to people who own a private car, those who do not own a private car are more likely to substitute e-shopping for shopping
trips. Hence, it could be concluded that e-shopping can reduce the travel demand for public transportation to a certain extent.
However, some important issues should be considered when the effect of e-shopping on the transportation system is discussed.
First, some researchers claim that, for some intangible goods (e.g., hairdressing), e-shopping can hardly replace the personal trips
because the consumer has to travel to collect or consume them (Clark & Unwin, 1981; Cohen-Blankshtain and Rotem-Mindali, 2016).
In this study, we only focus on these tangible goods (e.g., clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics), which are
transportable. It remains unclear whether e-shopping for intangible goods has the same effect on shopping trips (in China). Second,
although the substitution effect of e-shopping indicates that e-shopping can help consumers attain the strategy of saving time, it is not
certain whether the time saved by e-shopping is used to make other trips (Gould & Golob, 1997; Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden,
2013). Third, the more frequently people buy online, the higher demand for delivery service they will have. It is also possible that
delivery services cause additional urban congestion (Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Crocco et al., 2013; Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013), which we did not analyze in this study. Finally, the frequency of shopping trips is not the only factor affecting
urban traffic because the distance and duration of shopping trips also play important roles. In other words, it is possible that eshoppers
substitute e-shopping for shopping trips but extend the distance and duration of shopping trips at the same time. In this case,
the net effect of e-shopping on urban congestion might be negligible or even positive. The above-mentioned points could be regarded
as the future research directions.
In addition, the selection bias resulting from respondents being recruited in certain public spaces in Chengdu limits the generalizability
of our findings. Future studies might therefore approach respondents in varied types of spaces within Chengdu, but also
in other Chinese cities. Furthermore, other factors, such as individual work types, attitudes towards e-shopping and in-store shopping,
should be considered as potential determinants of e-shopping behavior in future research.

With the rapid proliferation of e-retailing, the question of how e-shopping affects shopping travel
has attracted increasing attention since the beginning of this century. To date, however, scholars
have failed to reach a consensus on this topic. Meanwhile, China, where currently the highest
level of e-retail shopping in the world takes place, has not received the full focus of previous
studies. Using data from structured interviews with 710 respondents in Chengdu, China, we aim
to explore whether e-shopping for four types of goods (clothes and shoes, electronics, food and
drink, and cosmetics) replaces shopping trips. In addition, regression models are constructed to
demonstrate the determinants of e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors. The results suggest
that consumers’ e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors are significantly determined by sociodemographics,
internet experience, car ownership, and location factors. E-shopping has a
substitution effect on the frequency of shopping trips. It is further suggested that e-shopping
could be regarded as a possible solution for urban congestion. In the long run, the number of
physical stores for the four types of goods may decrease.
1. Introduction
In recent years, e-shopping has grown immensely in most parts of the world. The largest development in e-retailing has occurred
in China. In 2016, the market size of e-retailing was ¥ 2.6 trillion (≈US $ 0.41 trillion) in the United States, but online retail sales
approached ¥ 4.7 trillion (≈US $ 0.74 trillion) in China, nearly doubling the size of retail sales in the United States (IResearch,
2017a). In 2014, the online retail share of total retail sales in China (10.6%) overtook that in the United States (9.5%). To date,
China’s online retail market has become the largest in the world (McKinsey & Company, 2016).
With e-shopping growing rapidly, the impact of e-shopping on shopping travel has been the focus of many researchers, since it is a
topic related to urban land use and transportation systems (Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). To date, four types of impacts have
been proposed (Salomon, 1986; Mokhtarian, 2002; Ferrell, 2005; Cao, 2009; Clarke et al., 2015): (1) Substitution – shopping trips
are replaced by e-shopping; (2) Complementarity – due to e-shopping, the frequency of shopping trips increases; (3) Modification –
owing to e-shopping, trips to physical stores are not replaced but are altered; and (4) Neutrality – e-shopping has no effect on
shopping travel. Not surprisingly, previous empirical studies show conflicting results. Some scholars assert that people reduce their
shopping trips due to e-shopping, which indicates that e-shopping has a substitution effect on shopping trips (Gould & Golob, 1998;

Ferrell, 2005; Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007, 2009; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Irawan & Wirza,
2015). In contrast, other researchers argue that people frequently buying or searching online tend to make more shopping trips,
suggesting a complementarity effect (Farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; Cao, 2012; Cao et al., 2010, 2012; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen
et al., 2016; Ding & Lu, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Xi et al., 2018). In addition, some scholars also state that e-shopping alters the
shopping travel pattern (e.g., duration, distance), which supports the modification effect (Mokhtarian, 2002; Ferrell, 2005; Farag
et al., 2006a, 2007). However, a few studies have shown that e-shopping does not have a significant effect on shopping travel,
indicating a neutrality impact (Sim & Koi, 2002; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014).
As the country with the largest online retail sales in the world, China is a well-suited study area to investigate the effect of eshopping
on shopping travel. It is also reasonable to assume that some significant effects might be found. However, despite some
studies analyzing e-shopping in China (Zhen et al., 2016; Ding & Lu, 2017), the number of studies is rather low compared to other
countries such as the Netherlands (Farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007, 2009; Maat
& Konings, 2018) and the United States (Cao et al., 2010, 2012; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Lee et al., 2017). In addition, the impact of eshopping
on shopping travel among countries may differ considerably. For example, Sim and Koi (2002) attributed the neutral effect
of e-shopping on shopping travel to Singaporean’s preferences. In a Scottish study, Calderwood and Freathy (2014) claimed that
specific situational factors on islands can affect the relationship between e-shopping and shopping travel. It is acknowledged that as
an emerging economy, China has a development context that is quite different from other (Western) countries. Therefore, it is vital to
use evidence from China to clarify this rather controversial issue.
In addition, congestion is a challenge faced by most cities in the world today (Christidis & Rivas, 2012; Alam & Ahmed, 2013;
Chang et al., 2017). Especially in China, with highly rapid urbanization process, traffic congestion has become one of the biggest
challenges for many cities. Therefore, it is important to clarify whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips, which
determines whether shopping online is a solution or a new challenge for urban congestion. As a result, focusing on this topic can have
important implications for urban transportation systems (Cao, 2012; Crocco et al., 2013; Zhen et al., 2016).
In this context, it is the key objective of this paper to examine whether e-shopping replaces shopping trips with evidence from
China. Using data from structured interviews concerning e-shopping behavior in the Chinese city of Chengdu in 2016, we will attempt
to answer the following questions: Q1 – What are the determinants of e-shopping behavior? Q2 – Does e-shopping replace shopping
trips? If yes, Q3 – what are the determinants of whether people substitute e-shopping for shopping trips? The paper is organized as
follows. In the next section, previous research is reviewed and discussed. Section 3 presents the development context in China.
Section 4 contains the research design and methodology, while Section 5 presents the main results. Conclusions and a discussion are
offered in the last section.
2. Literature review
2.1. E-shopping versus shopping trips
The topic of this study, i.e., the effect of e-shopping on shopping travel, has been analyzed for quite a while. Before the widespread
use of e-shopping, a related topic, the effect of telecommunication on transportation, has attracted scholarly attention since the 1960s
(Memmott, 1963; Nilles et al., 1976; Salomon, 1985, 1986; Mokhtarian, 2002). At that time, the relationships between telecommunication
and transportation were in early stages. For example, substitution, complementarity, and neutrality had been raised
by theoretical frameworks. Subsequently, borrowing from these relationships, some scholars attempted to build a conceptual framework
to explain shopping behavior (Salomon, 1985, 1986; Mokhtarian, 2002). From this point on, this framework has been used
widely in empirical research to explore the association between e-shopping and shopping travel (Farag et al., 2006a, 2007;
Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007; Clarke et al., 2015). To date, a significant body of literature has investigated
the impacts of e-shopping on shopping travel. However, four types of effects are supported by substantial empirical evidence.
(1) Substitution. Gould and Golob (1998) were the first to analyze whether e-shopping will replace shopping trips using empirical
evidence. They believed that although a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips exists, its effect is negligible in the
United States. Subsequently, also using data from the United States, research by Ferrell (2005) indicated that respondents avoid
20% of a shopping trip for every 100 min they spend on e-shopping. Evidence from the Netherlands confirms this finding. For
instance, Weltevreden and Rietbergen (2007, 2009) found that more than 20% of respondents agreed that they reduce the
shopping trips to city center stores due to e-shopping. Weltevreden (2007) further noted that in the long run, physical stores for
some retail categories will be substituted by e-stores. Weltevreden and Rotem-Mindali (2009) also showed that e-shopping leads
to a net reduction in the amount of personal shopping trips. In addition, Irawan and Wirza (2015) similarly found in Indonesia
that e-shopping can decrease consumers’ willingness to conduct shopping trips.
(2) Complementarity. In a Dutch study, Farag et al. (2005, 2007) found that frequent online searchers are inclined to make more
shopping trips than infrequent online searchers. Farag et al. (2006a) further showed a complementary effect of e-shopping on
shopping trips, since results indicated that people who purchase online tend to buy at physical stores more frequently. Based on
shopping survey data in the United States, Cao et al. (2010) claimed that 49.3% of respondents were inclined to make a new trip
to physical stores after seeing goods online, which indicated that the shopping trip was encouraged by e-shopping. Cao et al.
(2012) also found that the frequency of e-shopping has a positive effect on the frequency of shopping trips. Cao (2012) further
showed that the generation effect of e-shopping on shopping trips will impose extra burdens on existing transportation systems.
Similarly, Zhou and Wang (2014) and Lee et al. (2017) also found a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and
K. Shi, et al. Transportation Research Part A 122 (2019) 21–33
22
shopping trips. In addition to the studies mentioned above, a limited number of studies from China have been published in recent
years. Using data from Nanjing, Zhen et al. (2016) and Xi et al. (2018) found a positive linkage between the frequency of buying
or searching online and the frequency of shopping trips. Applying a structural equation modeling approach to data from Beijing,
Ding and Lu (2017) claimed that e-shopping frequency has a positive association with the frequency of shopping trips to physical
stores.
(3) Neutrality. Mokhtarian (2002) noted that not every e-shopping activity will replace shopping trips; thus, its impact on shopping
travel could be overlooked. Using Singapore as the study area, Sim and Koi (2002) stated that the effect of e-shopping on
shopping travel is quite slim because Singaporeans prefer to purchase at physical stores rather than e-stores. Calderwood and
Freathy (2014) found that almost 80% of respondents indicated that the frequency of shopping trips was not affected by eshopping
in the Scottish Isles.
(4) Modification. Ferrell (2005) found that e-shoppers tend to take shorter-distance shopping trips in the United States. Similarly,
Farag et al. (2006a, 2007) showed that the more frequently people buy online in the Netherlands, the less time they spend on
shopping trips to physical stores.
From these previous studies, two main lessons can be learned. On the one hand, apart from a few cases, it is evident that eshopping
has an effect on shopping travel. However, it remains rather uncertain whether this is due to substitution or complementarity
effects. In this context, empirical evidence from an area with great e-shopping potential (e.g., China) can shed some new
light on this issue. On the other hand, scholars largely ignored the shopping travel implications of China’s large e-retailing market
before 2016. Since then, only a few studies have begun to reveal this topic using evidence from China (e.g., Zhen et al., 2016; Ding &
Lu, 2017; Xi et al., 2018).
Furthermore, some existing studies do not seem to be able to determine whether e-shopping generates shopping trips. Some
scholars found a positive association between the frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips and consequently claimed that there
exists a complementary effect of e-shopping on shopping trips (e.g., Farag et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al.,
2016; Ding & Lu, 2017). However, evidence is limited because, for example, most e-shoppers are likely to decrease their frequency of
shopping trips due to e-shopping. Frequent e-shoppers, however, still make more shopping trips than infrequent e-shoppers, as they
have a higher shopping demand. In this case, the frequency of shopping trips is not encouraged by e-shopping, and a positive
association does not indicate complementarity but indicates substitution. Meanwhile, when respondents were asked whether they
changed the frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping, they mostly indicated a reduction in frequency (e.g., Weltevreden, 2007;
Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014). Compared to the former case,
it is more reasonable to explore the issue in the latter case.
Three studies focusing on China indicate a complementary effect of e-shopping on the frequency of shopping trips because a
positive association between e-shopping or online searching and shopping trip frequency was found (Zhen et al., 2016; Ding & Lu,
2017, Xi et al., 2018). However, their findings seem untenable. Previous studies suggest that the effect of e-shopping on shopping
trips to stores is associated with whether these stores will be eliminated (Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2009; Cao
et al., 2013). In other words, assuming that e-shopping stimulates consumers to make more shopping trips to physical stores, new
physical stores might emerge. In this case, the demand for land by the retail industry is more likely to be extended to a certain extent.
However, Zhang et al. (2016) found that the demand for retail real estate is inhibited by e-commerce in China, which is irreconcilable
with the findings of Zhen et al. (2016), Ding and Lu (2017) and Xi et al. (2018).
2.2. E-shopping determinants
To date, many studies have investigated the factors affecting e-shopping behavior. Sociodemographic factors have been tested
frequently in previous studies. First, gender is found to affect e-shopping behavior, but conflicting results have been presented. In
some studies, women are more likely to adopt e-shopping than men (Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). However, some
opposite findings have shown that men are more inclined to purchase online (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Crocco et al., 2013). In
addition, Zhen et al. (2016) stated that men are more likely to conduct e-shopping for electronics than women, but women are more
likely to shop online for clothes and daily goods than men. Lee et al. (2015), on the other hand, found that gender has no significant
effect on e-shopping behavior. Second, some researchers stated that age negatively influences e-shopping behavior (Farag et al.,
2007; Crocco et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Irawan & Wirza, 2015; Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). However, a
nonlinear relationship between age and e-shopping behavior was found by Farag et al. (2006b) and Zhen et al. (2018). They found
that up to the age of 33 years old, the probability of purchasing online rises with increasing age. After 33 years old, the probability of
purchasing online starts to decline. Third, a positive influence of income on e-shopping behavior was found by a considerable number
of studies (Farag et al., 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012, 2013; Crocco et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al., 2016, 2018).
However, Farag et al. (2006b) and Ding and Lu (2017) found an insignificant effect concerning income. Irawan and Wirza (2015)
even stated that low-income groups tend to purchase online more frequently. Fourth, it has been suggested that people with higher
education levels are more inclined to engage in e-shopping (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012; Zhou & Wang,
2014; Zhen et al., 2018), although Ding and Lu (2017) argued that education does not matter for e-shopping behavior. Irawan and
Wirza (2015) even held a contrary opinion that people who are more educated are unlikely to purchase online.
Individual internet experiences have also been tested in previous studies. It has been indicated that the frequency of internet use
positively affects e-shopping behavior (Ding & Lu, 2017; Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Cao et al., 2013; Maat & Konings, 2018). Furthermore,
studies by Farag et al. (2007) and Ren and Kwan (2009) showed that the number of years using the internet positively
K. Shi, et al. Transportation Research Part A 122 (2019) 21–33
23
affects e-shopping behavior. Similarly, Irawan and Wirza (2015) stated that using the internet on a weekly base has a positive effect
on e-shopping. With the widespread use of smartphones, e-shopping on smartphones has become common behavior. Maat and
Konings (2018) stated that people who have a smartphone conduct e-shopping more frequently.
Car ownership is also expected to influence an individual’s e-shopping behavior. A study by Irawan and Wirza (2015) indicated
that both the number of vehicles that households own and the number of family members having a driver’s license positively affect eshopping
frequency in Indonesia. Similarly, Zhen et al. (2016) found that people possessing a driver’s license are more inclined to
purchase online for clothes, electronics, books, and daily goods in Nanjing, China. In contrast, Farag et al. (2006a) claimed that car
ownership has an insignificant effect on the adoption of e-shopping in the United States. Notably, ignoring car ownership, Zhen et al.
(2016) explored only the effect of driver’s license possession on e-shopping behavior in China. Given the conflicting results in
previous studies, it remains unclear how car ownership influences e-shopping behavior in China.
Geographers have paid much attention to the effect of location factors on e-shopping behavior. At the beginning of the 2000s, two
plausible hypotheses were proposed (Anderson et al., 2003; Boschma and Weltevreden, 2004; Farag et al., 2006b). One is the
innovation diffusion hypothesis, stating that urban residents are most likely to adopt e-shopping, as they are better educated and
more likely to actively use the internet for other purposes. The other is the efficiency hypothesis, which postulates that people in
nonmetropolitan or suburban areas are more likely to adopt e-shopping, since they can benefit more from online shopping as a
consequence of lower accessibility to stores. The two hypotheses have subsequently been tested by empirical evidence. Farag et al.
(2005, 2007) stated that people living in more urbanized areas are inclined to purchase online, which tends to support the innovation
diffusion hypothesis. Similarly, Cao et al. (2013) and Zhou and Wang (2014) found that people living in urban areas engage in more
frequent e-shopping. On the other hand, Krizek et al. (2005) showed that – in metropolitan areas – people living in the suburbs or
further from the city center purchase more frequently online, which seems to confirm the efficiency hypothesis. Given that shopping
trips are usually chained with trips for other purposes, especially commuting trips (Salomon, 1986; Ferrell, 2005; Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013), the effect of work location on e-shopping has also been tested (Zhen et al., 2018). The results indicate that
people living and working in urban areas are more likely to purchase books online. Surprisingly, McHugh (2014) found that location
factors have no significant effect on e-shopping behavior.
Except for the above factors examined most frequently in previous studies, other factors are also expected to determine eshopping
behavior. For example, some studies have shown that the type of work can play a key role in e-shopping behavior (Ren &
Kwan, 2009; Cao et al., 2013; Irawan & Wirza, 2015). The effect of attitudes towards e-shopping or in-store shopping on e-shopping
behavior has also been discussed in other studies (Cao et al., 2010, 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Irawan & Wirza, 2015).
Although a significant body of research has explored e-shopping determinants, very few studies have investigated the determinants
of whether people increase or decrease shopping trip frequency due to e-shopping. Weltevreden & Rietbergen (2009) examined
this question and determined some interesting findings: (1) For nondaily goods, people who frequently purchase online, have low
accessibility to shops by car, enjoy in-store shopping to a limited degree, or are relatively young are more likely to substitute eshopping
for shopping trips. However, gender and education do not seem to play a significant role. (2) For specialty goods, people
who purchase online frequently, search online frequently, have low accessibility to shops by car, have less enjoyment for in-store
shopping, or are male tend to substitute e-shopping for shopping trips. Age has a nonlinear effect on the probability of making fewer
shopping trips.
Overall, there have been conflicting results concerning e-shopping determinants. For example, gender, age, and location seem to
play different roles in e-shopping among existing studies. It is reasonable to assume that we can attribute these conflicting outcomes
not only to research limitations (e.g., methodology, definition of e-shopping, quality of data) but also to local contexts of study areas
(e.g., economic development, urbanization, informatization, social culture). Hence, the determinants of e-shopping should be explored
in various regions.
3. Development contexts in China
As an emerging economy, China has a special context that is different from other (Western) countries. Considering that local
contexts have a profound effect on e-shopping behavior (e.g., Sim & Koi, 2002; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014), it is necessary to
present the development contexts in China, which may contribute to the understanding of the following analysis results.
In recent years, China has enjoyed a rapid urbanization. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2016a) indicated
that the urbanization rate (percentage of people living in urban areas) in China increased to 56% in 2015 from 38% in 2001. It was
reported by the Chengdu Municipal Commission of Economy and Information Technology (2017) that the total population reached
15.9 million with an urbanization rate of 70.6% in 2016 in Chengdu. Consequently, the considerable transport congestion is mainly
caused by rapid urbanization and a very high population density in Chengdu and other Chinese large cities. Additionally, compared
to most Western countries, China has a relatively low rate of car ownership (Zhen et al., 2016, 2018). Therefore, it may not be
convenient for many urban residents in China to make shopping trips by private cars. In this context, the residents’ desire for
shopping trips may be reduced because e-shopping has become a viable alternative.
In addition, with the booming growth of the e-retailing market, the demand for delivery service has increased dramatically. It was
reported by the State Post Bureau of China (2016) that the number of fast deliveries, which are mainly used for e-shopping, reached
20.67 billion in 2015, representing a 48% increase from 2014. Furthermore, the revenue from fast deliveries was 276.96 billion Yuan
(≈US $ 43.90 billion) in 2015, representing a 35% increase from 2014. Consequently, delivery companies have emerged rapidly in
China. In recent years, some have become listed companies, such as Shunfeng Co. Ltd., Yuantong Co. Ltd., and Shentong Co. Ltd.
Thus, unlike most Western countries, delivery service stations are distributed densely from cities to villages in China, partially
K. Shi, et al. Transportation Research Part A 122 (2019) 21–33
24
because these companies offer fast delivery services at a relatively low price. Usually, consumers living in large cities can receive
goods on the day or the day after they order online. Consumers living in other areas can always receive goods within seven days.
Thus, high-quality delivery services may attract people to adopt e-shopping, which is one of the main reasons why the largest online
retail development has occurred in China.
China also has particular experience in terms of retail development. Before e-shopping emerged, purchasing by telephone or mail
was popular in most Western countries. Hence, some scholars postulated that people might substitute e-shopping for buying by
telephone or mail but not for shopping trips (Salomon, 1985; Keskinen et al., 2001; Mokhtarian, 2004; Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013). However, unlike Western countries, telephone and internet were not used frequently in China before the 1990s.
Consequently, the retail marketing by telephone and mail was not fully mature before e-shopping emerged. Therefore, in China, it
seems that people might substitute e-shopping for shopping trips but not for buying by telephone or mail.
4. Methodology
4.1. Data collection
4.1.1. Study area and dataset
Data from this research is drawn from structured interviews conducted in July and August 2016 in Chengdu, China. Chengdu, the
capital of Sichuan Province, is located in southwest China (see Fig. 1). In 2016, Chengdu was listed as one of eight National Central
Cities by the National Development and Reform Commission of China (2016). The National Bureau of Statistics of China (2016b)
reported that in Chengdu, the number of internet service subscribers was 4.74 million households in 2015 and total retail sales of
consumer goods reached ¥ 494.62 billion (≈US $ 78.03 billion). Apparently, Chengdu has enjoyed rapid urbanization and informatization
and has had a significant body of demand for retail, suggesting an enormous potential for e-shopping. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that Chengdu is a good and representative case city for this study.
A cluster sampling approach was used to select neighborhoods and respondents in five steps. First, we defined the target population
as people who have used e-shopping at least once in their life, i.e., e-shoppers (partly because people who had never
purchased online in Chengdu turned out very hard to find when conducting a preliminary survey). Second, we determined the desired
sample size (approximately 600–1000 respondents) which would make it possible to conduct regression analyses with ample confidence.
Third, the sampled area was defined as the built-up area within the Third Ring Road of Chengdu (see Fig. 1), where most of
Chengdu’s residents live. Fourth, the number of the sampled neighborhoods was determined (10 sampled neighborhoods). Fifth,
among the public spaces (which were open and accessible for every resident), we geographically randomly selected 10 sampled
neighborhoods (within the sampled area), in which the structured interviews were performed: Chunxilu Shopping Center, Jinniu-
Wanda Shopping Center, Laifushi Shopping Center, Hongpailou Shopping Center, Kaide Shopping Center, Tianfu Square, Shahe Park,
Huanhuaxi Park, Tazishan Park, and Dongjiaojiyi Music Park (see Fig. 1).
To minimize selection bias, we made some efforts. On the one hand, our interviews were conducted after people finished work on
weekdays and during the entire day on weekends. On the other hand, a set of postcards marked with the Lanzhou University logo was
provided as an incentive after the respondent finished the survey. In the end, 1796 people were approached to participate in the
survey, and 882 accepted our invitation. The response rate was 49.1%. The group of people who did not participate in this survey
were those who indicated being in a rush or not being interested or people who had never adopted e-shopping. After removal of some
questionnaires missing key responses, 710 valid samples were collected.
As shown in Table 1, 51.1% of the respondents are men, and 58.5% of them are younger than 26. According to a report by the
China Electronic Commerce Research Center (2016), 47.4% of e-shoppers in China are men, and 51.2% of them are younger than 27.
Based on this rudimentary comparison (due to a lack of additional information on Chinese e-shoppers), our respondents seem rather
representative of China’s e-shoppers. However, conducting the survey in public spaces might result in a certain level of selection bias.
First, at these locations (but also at other places in China), older people are less inclined to participate in surveys. However, because
these people often do not purchase goods online, this was not a major problem for this study. Consequently, our respondents are
relatively young (but not considerably younger than the total population of Chinese e-shoppers). Second, people who lived in the
sampled area but do not regularly visit these public spaces were ignored.
The dataset consists of five categories of information. The first category includes individual sociodemographic information, such
as age, gender, and educational background. The second category is information about internet experience and car ownership. The
third category is the departure place from which the respondent mostly makes a shopping trip. The fourth category is the frequency of
e-shopping and shopping trips to physical stores. Considering that the frequency of e-shopping might vary among types of goods
(Weltevreden, 2007; Zhen et al., 2016, 2018), we selected four types of goods that are purchased online most frequently in China:
clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics. The respondents were asked to provide the monthly frequency of eshopping
for four types of goods (see Table 2) and to provide the monthly frequency of shopping trips to physical stores for these
goods (both for a “regular month”). Based on the methodologies of previous studies (Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rietbergen,
2007; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Calderwood & Freathy, 2014), the fifth category is change in the frequency of shopping
trips and total shopping1 owing to e-shopping. The respondents were asked to answer two questions: After adopting e-shopping for
the four types of goods, (1) do you change your frequency of shopping trips to physical stores? (2) do you change your frequency of
1 In this study, we define total shopping as the sum of e-shopping and in-store shopping, which roughly reflects respondents’ shopping demand.

total shopping? The alternative answers to the two questions were set on a 5-point scale: decreased substantially, decreased somewhat,
no change, increased somewhat, and increased substantially.
4.1.2. Dependent variable
In this study, we used two dependent variable categories:
(1) The frequency of e-shopping and shopping trips for four types of goods are extracted as the data source of the dependent variable.
First, we sum the frequency of e-shopping for four types of goods, representing the frequency of e-shopping (see Table 1). Second,
the frequency of shopping trips to physical stores for these goods is used to reflect the frequency of shopping trips. Third, as
performed by Maat and Konings (2018), we calculate the share of e-shopping frequency in total shopping frequency to indicate
the probability that the respondents adopt e-shopping when having a shopping demand.
(2) As mentioned earlier, the determinants of whether to decrease or increase the frequency of shopping trips due to e-shopping have
not been explored properly before. This study will attempt to fill this research gap. To do so, we analyze whether e-shopping
replaces or generates shopping trips as a dependent variable.
4.1.3. Explanatory variable
Based on the literature review above, we identify several explanatory variable categories (sociodemographics, internet experience,
car ownership, and spatial attributes) as reported in Table 3. Given a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trip frequency,
Weltevreden and Rietbergen (2007, 2009) found that people frequently purchasing online have a higher probability of
reducing their shopping trips. Since it is currently unclear whether this effect can also be found in China, the frequency of e-shopping
is added as the explanatory variable of whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips.
Additionally, home location is expected to be an explanatory variable of e-shopping behavior in previous studies, since it determines
the accessibility to physical stores (Farag et al., 2005, 2007; Cao et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014). However, some scholars
have argued that the residential location may not indicate accessibility because shopping trips are usually chained with other trips,
especially commuting trips (Salomon, 1986; Ferrell, 2005; Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). In other words, assuming that
someone lives in a weakly urbanized area but works in a strongly urbanized area, he/she usually departs for a shopping trip from a
work location. In this case, he/she has a high accessibility to physical stores even though he/she lives in a weakly urbanized area.
Therefore, the accessibility to physical stores is not determined by residential location but by the departure location for a shopping
trip. Using the residential location as the explanatory variable has its shortcomings. Although Zhen et al. (2018) made an effort to
consider both home location and work location as the spatial variable, it is still not the best solution to make up for this shortcoming.
Hence, we regard the departure location where the respondent mostly makes a shopping trip as the independent variable representing
the location factor. Chengdu is a city with a high urbanization level that continuously decreases from city center to city periphery. In
this context, we define the area within the Third Ring Road as the urban area, the area between the Third Ring Road and the Fourth
Ring Road as the suburban area, and the area outside the Fourth Ring Road as the exurban area (see Fig. 1).

4.2. Modeling approach
In this study, we develop three types of regression models. First, given that the frequency of e-shopping and the frequency of
shopping trips are two sets of count variables, both Poisson and negative binomial regression models can be adopted. However, the
means of two sets of count variables are both smaller than their variances,2 which does not support the requirement of the Poisson
regression model that the mean of the dependent variable is roughly equal to its variance. Negative binomial regression models are
therefore employed to investigate the determinants of e-shopping and shopping trip frequency. Second, considering that the share of
e-shopping is a continuous variable and largely follows a normal distribution,3 we develop a linear regression model to identify the
determinants of the share of e-shopping. Third, we further develop a binomial logistic regression model to search for the determinants
of whether e-shopping replaces or generates shopping trips, which is a set of binary variables.
5. Results
5.1. Determinants of e-shopping frequency, shopping trip frequency, and share of e-shopping
As reported in Tables 4 and 5, sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership and spatial attributes are found to significantly
affect e-shopping frequency, shopping trip frequency, and share of e-shopping.
The results indicate that women are more likely to purchase online frequently, which is consistent with the findings of several
previous studies (e.g., Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). Additionally, women also make more shopping trips and have a
higher share of e-shopping. This finding is in line with the Chinese study of Ding and Lu (2017), suggesting that women are,
compared to men, more likely to purchase both online and in-store. Zhen et al. (2016) found that shopping responsibility is largely
determined by gender. In China, women usually bear more shopping responsibility for families than men, probably resulting in a
higher shopping demand.
We found that older respondents are also more likely to purchase online frequently. This result seems to contradict with many
previous studies (Farag et al., 2007; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Irawan & Wirza, 2015; Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). However,
this result is not that surprising, since our respondents are relatively young. To a large extent, our findings are consistent with the
findings of Farag et al. (2006b) and Zhen et al. (2018), claiming that for respondents younger than 34, age has a positive effect on eshopping
frequency. Similarly, older people tend to make more shopping trips probably because shopping responsibilities for families
grow with increasing age. People with higher education are more likely to purchase online frequently, which supports many previous
studies (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012; Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al., 2018). Additionally, people with a
higher educational background are also inclined to make more shopping trips, which is consistent with the finding of Farag et al.
(2005).
Income is negatively associated with the frequency of both e-shopping and shopping trips, possibly because people with higher
incomes have more time pressure and a higher value of time, resulting in a lower demand for both e-shopping and in-store shopping.
Although quite a number of researchers found that higher-income respondents are more likely to purchase online frequently (e.g.,
Farag et al., 2007; Blasio, 2008; Cao et al., 2012, 2013, Zhou & Wang, 2014; Zhen et al., 2016, 2018), it seems that respondents with
lower incomes can benefit more from purchasing online. It is an important asset for e-retailers that, using the same amount of money
as before, consumers can purchase more goods online since the goods are provided at a lower price by e-retailers (Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013). Hence, purchasing online is a good strategy for consumers to save money, resulting in high levels of e-shopping
for people who have low income levels. In addition, people who have a higher income may pay more attention to the quality of goods
than price. Thus, they are less likely to purchase online, as the quality of online goods is relatively low in China (Ding & Lu, 2017). We
also found that people with a high cost of living are more likely to conduct both e-shopping and shopping trips frequently, which can
be largely explained by their higher shopping demand.
However, our results show that people with considerable experience using internet on PCs have a lower interest in e-shopping,
which is inconsistent with most existing research (Farag et al., 2006b, 2007; Farag et al., 2007; Ren & Kwan, 2009; Cao et al., 2013;
Irawan & Wirza, 2015; Ding & Lu, 2017; Maat & Konings, 2018). This finding may be attributed to the new context of the information
era in China. It has been reported that 55.5% of Chinese e-retailing sales in 2015 were conducted by mobile terminals, such as
smartphones and iPads (IResearch, 2017b). The possible reasons why people transfer e-shopping partially to mobile devices instead
of a personal computer (PC) in China are as follows. On the one hand, compared to PCs, mobile devices have unique advantages, such
as ubiquity, convenience, localization, and personalization (Groß, 2015). On the other hand, some apps installed on mobile terminals
for payment are very popular in China, such as Alipay, WeChat payment. Therefore, with the widespread use of smartphones, the use
of PCs is no longer necessary for e-shopping and can even be regarded as burdensome. Moreover, people who have a long history of
using PCs may have developed risk awareness. Some studies have indicated that risk aversion has a negative effect on e-shopping
(Park and Kim, 2003; Al-Debei et al., 2015). Thus, they may tend to partake in less e-shopping. Although Ding and Lu (2017) found
that the duration of internet use has a significant positive effect on online shopping in China, the data in their study were collected in
2012, when only 5.8% of e-retailing sales were conducted by mobile devices (IResearch, 2017b).
2 The means of e-shopping and shopping trip frequency are 8.50 and 7.40, and the variances are 68.76 and 43.17, respectively.
3 The skewness and kurtosis of e-shopping shares are 0.60 and 0.15, respectively (smaller than 1), indicating that the set of variables largely
follows the normal distribution.

28
Moreover, people owning a car tend to conduct fewer shopping trips, which is in line with the finding of Farag et al. (2007),
possibly because they can transport more goods by car at a time. On the other hand, traffic congestion at shopping centers may also
inhibit them from driving a car to go shopping.
In addition, location plays a key role in e-shopping behavior. The results indicate that people who mostly start their shopping trips
from urban areas are more likely to purchase online frequently. Furthermore, people who mostly start their shopping trips from urban
areas or exurban areas are inclined to have a higher e-shopping share compared to respondents departing from suburban areas. Since
the individual factors (e.g., age, education, income, internet experience) are controlled for in the model, the built environment seems
to have a significant effect on e-shopping share. For people departing from urban areas, higher accessibility to physical stores might
result in a higher interest in e-shopping. For example, it is more convenient for them to visit a physical store to ensure the quality of
goods before shopping online, which could stimulate them to conduct more e-shopping because of lower prices of online goods

(Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). This result seems consistent with the innovation diffusion hypothesis (Anderson et al., 2003)
and roughly confirms the findings of some studies on e-shopping (Farag et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2013; Zhou & Wang, 2014). For people
departing from exurban areas, it is more convenient to conduct e-shopping compared to shopping trips because of lower accessibility
to physical stores. This result is in line with the findings of Ren and Kwan (2009) and provides empirical evidence to loosely support
the efficiency hypothesis. However, compared to urban areas, people who mostly start a shopping trip from suburban areas find it less
convenient to visit a physical store before e-shopping. Respondents starting their trips from suburban areas also benefit less from
online shopping because of higher accessibility to physical stores compared to exurban areas. Both explanations might partly explain
the finding that people departing in suburban areas are less likely to conduct e-shopping.
Interestingly, some factors play similar roles in both e-shopping and shopping trip frequency. For instance, women, or people who
are older, better educated, with a lower income, or with a higher cost of living tend to conduct both e-shopping and shopping trips
frequently. This finding is probably attributed to their higher shopping demand.
5.2. The effect of e-shopping on shopping trip frequency
In this section, we aim to explore the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips by analyzing change in the frequency of shopping trips
owing to e-shopping. As shown in Table 6, more than 44% of the respondents indicate that they make fewer shopping trips due to eshopping,
although 14.9% of the respondents say that they increase shopping trip frequency. As a result, it can be suggested that in
most cases, e-shopping has a substitution effect on shopping trips, which is consistent with some previous studies (Ferrell, 2005;
Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2007, 2009; Weltevreden, 2007; Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Irawan & Wirza, 2015). We can
attribute this finding to China’s emerging contexts mentioned above: urban traffic congestion, relatively low rate of car ownership,
and developed e-retailing and (fast) delivery service.
5.3. The effect of e-shopping on total shopping frequency
Interestingly, we also find that more than 70% of the respondents indicate that e-shopping makes them increase the frequency of
total shopping, i.e., conventional shopping and e-shopping combined (see Table 7). That is, e-shopping has a promotion effect on the
shopping demand. Three reasons may lead to this result. First, it is widely acknowledged that saving time is one of the most important
motivations for e-shopping (Farag et al., 2006a, 2007). Hence, the time saved by e-shopping may be exploited by consumers to
conduct more shopping. Second, compared to conventional channels, e-commerce provides more convenience to consumers to acquire
goods information, which may seduce consumers to have more desire for shopping (Weltevreden & Rietbergen, 2004; Cao,
2012). Third, the goods are usually sold with a lower price on the e-retail website. Thus, using the same amount of money as before,
the consumer can buy more goods online (Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013). It should be noted that, the finding that e-shopping
partially replaces shopping trips but also generates more shopping in total is not necessarily conflicting.
5.4. Determinants of whether e-shopping replaces shopping trips
Given a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips, we aim to explore the determinants of whether respondents substitute
e-shopping for shopping trips by using a binomial logistic regression model in this section. As shown in Table 8, People who do not
own a private car tend to reduce their shopping trips. Usually, they use public transport for shopping trips and thus must spend more

time on a shopping trip than those who drive to shops. Hence, compared to in-store shopping, purchasing online becomes a better
way for them to save time, resulting in the substitution of shopping trips. The outcome also indicates that, due to e-shopping, people
who purchase online frequently are less likely to reduce shopping trip frequency. Although this result is inconsistent with the finding
of Weltevreden and Rietbergen (2007, 2009), it could be explained as follows. As observed before, people who purchase online more
frequently seem to have a higher shopping demand, which may make them have less likelihood to reduce their shopping trips. In
addition, no significant associations between other factors (e.g., sociodemographics, internet experience, or spatial attributes) and
substitution of e-shopping for shopping trips are found.
6. Conclusion and discussion
Using data from 710 structured interviews in 2016 in Chengdu, China, we aim to examine whether e-shopping for four types of
goods (clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics) replaces shopping trips. This paper made the following contributions.
First, we investigated the effect of e-shopping on shopping trips with evidence from China, where the largest amount of eretailing
in the world takes place, as China was largely ignored by previous studies. Second, we identified the determinants of
whether people substitute e-shopping for shopping trips, which is an important gap in previous studies. Third, we redefined the
“location” as where people mostly start their shopping trips, which is different from that in previous studies. The new definition of

“location” in this study may be regarded as an improvement compared to previous studies, since shopping trips are mostly chained
with other trips.
In sum, our results indicate that sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership, and location factors (partially) affect
consumers’ e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors. In particular, with regard to location, two approaches measuring e-shopping
lead to different results. People who mostly start their shopping trips from urban areas are likely to purchase online more frequently.
However, people who mostly start their shopping trips from urban or exurban areas are likely to have a higher e-shopping share.
Roughly speaking, we find empirical evidence from China to support both the innovation diffusion hypothesis and efficiency diffusion.
Moreover, the results also suggest that more than 44% of the respondents tend to reduce their shopping trips due to eshopping,
although a limited number of respondents (14.9%) indicate the opposite. Hence, by and large, e-shopping has a substitution
effect on the frequency of shopping trips in China. Meanwhile, more than 70% of the respondents indicate that e-shopping
increases the frequency of total shopping, suggesting that their shopping demands are generated by e-shopping. Furthermore, people
who own a car, or purchase online more frequently are less likely to substitute e-shopping for shopping trips.
Given the finding that e-shopping has a substitution effect on the shopping trips to physical stores, these stores may experience a
loss of consumers. In this case, it is reasonable to believe that in the long run, physical stores for clothes and shoes, electronics, food
and drink, and cosmetics will reduce in number. Our conclusion is directly or indirectly supported by some previous publications. For
example, IResearch (2017a) reported that the sale size of grocery stores and large markets declined 10.4% and 0.2%, respectively, in
Chinese cities from 2013 to 2015. Zhang et al. (2016) also found that the extension of urban commercial land is inhibited by ecommerce.
Although the continuous growth of shopping demands in China may offset the negative effect of e-shopping on physical
stores, a loss of revenue for conventional stores still exists owing to such a large size and dramatic-rapid growth rate of e-shopping
market in China.
Our results have two implications for transportation systems. On the one hand, e-shopping might be a possible solution for urban
congestion because a substitution effect of e-shopping on shopping trips is found. On the other hand, people who do not have a
private car normally make a shopping trip to stores on foot or by public transportation. Meanwhile, our results indicate that,
compared to people who own a private car, those who do not own a private car are more likely to substitute e-shopping for shopping
trips. Hence, it could be concluded that e-shopping can reduce the travel demand for public transportation to a certain extent.
However, some important issues should be considered when the effect of e-shopping on the transportation system is discussed.
First, some researchers claim that, for some intangible goods (e.g., hairdressing), e-shopping can hardly replace the personal trips
because the consumer has to travel to collect or consume them (Clark & Unwin, 1981; Cohen-Blankshtain and Rotem-Mindali, 2016).
In this study, we only focus on these tangible goods (e.g., clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics), which are
transportable. It remains unclear whether e-shopping for intangible goods has the same effect on shopping trips (in China). Second,
although the substitution effect of e-shopping indicates that e-shopping can help consumers attain the strategy of saving time, it is not
certain whether the time saved by e-shopping is used to make other trips (Gould & Golob, 1997; Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden,
2013). Third, the more frequently people buy online, the higher demand for delivery service they will have. It is also possible that
delivery services cause additional urban congestion (Weltevreden & Rotem-Mindali, 2009; Crocco et al., 2013; Rotem-Mindali &
Weltevreden, 2013), which we did not analyze in this study. Finally, the frequency of shopping trips is not the only factor affecting
urban traffic because the distance and duration of shopping trips also play important roles. In other words, it is possible that eshoppers
substitute e-shopping for shopping trips but extend the distance and duration of shopping trips at the same time. In this case,
the net effect of e-shopping on urban congestion might be negligible or even positive. The above-mentioned points could be regarded
as the future research directions.
In addition, the selection bias resulting from respondents being recruited in certain public spaces in Chengdu limits the generalizability
of our findings. Future studies might therefore approach respondents in varied types of spaces within Chengdu, but also
in other Chinese cities. Furthermore, other factors, such as individual work types, attitudes towards e-shopping and in-store shopping,
should be considered as potential determinants of e-shopping behavior in future research.
