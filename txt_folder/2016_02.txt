Objectives
HIV-positive people have increased risk of infection-related malignancies (IRMs) and infectionunrelated
malignancies (IURMs). The aim of the study was to determine the impact of aging on
future IRM and IURM incidence.
Methods
People enrolled in EuroSIDA and followed from the latest of the first visit or 1 January 2001 until
the last visit or death were included in the study. Poisson regression was used to investigate the
impact of aging on the incidence of IRMs and IURMs, adjusting for demographic, clinical and
laboratory confounders. Linear exponential smoothing models forecasted future incidence.
Results
A total of 15 648 people contributed 95 033 person-years of follow-up, of whom 610 developed 643
malignancies [IRMs: 388 (60%); IURMs: 255 (40%)]. After adjustment, a higher IRM incidence was
associated with a lower CD4 count [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) CD4 count < 200 cells/lL: 3.77;
95% confidence interval (CI) 2.59, 5.51; compared with ≥ 500 cells/lL], independent of age, while a
CD4 count < 200 cells/lL was associated with IURMs in people aged < 50 years only (aIRR: 2.51; 95%
CI 1.40–4.54). Smoking was associated with IURMs (aIRR: 1.75; 95% CI 1.23, 2.49) compared with
never smokers in people aged ≥ 50 years only, and not with IRMs. The incidences of both IURMs and
IRMs increased with older age. It was projected that the incidence of IRMs would decrease by 29% over
a 5-year period from 3.1 (95% CI 1.5–5.9) per 1000 person-years in 2011, whereas the IURM incidence
would increase by 44% from 4.1 (95% CI 2.2–7.2) per 1000 person-years over the same period.
Conclusions
Demographic and HIV-related risk factors for IURMs (aging and smoking) and IRMs
(immunodeficiency and ongoing viral replication) differ markedly and the contribution from
IURMs relative to IRMs will continue to increase as a result of aging of the HIV-infected
population, high smoking and lung cancer prevalence and a low prevalence of untreated HIV
infection. These findings suggest the need for targeted preventive measures and evaluation of the
costbenefit of screening for IURMs in HIV-infected populations.

Introduction
HIV-positive people are at increased risk of many malignancies
compared with the general population [1,2]; however,
the exact mechanisms are poorly understood [3]. The
increased risk could be attributable to a high prevalence of

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
traditional cancer risk factors such as smoking [4] and
alcohol use [5]. However, coinfection with other pro-oncogenic
viruses [6], immunodeficiency [2,7], activated
inflammation and coagulation [8], a potential direct prooncogenic
effect of HIV and combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART) toxicity [3] may also contribute to the
increased risk. The introduction of cART in 1996 led to
restored immune function, a reduced incidence of AIDSdefining
malignancies (ADMs) [9–11] and increased survival
[12]. As a result, the burden of cancers traditionally
associated with older age is becoming increasingly important
in the HIV-positive population. There is a growing
need to address the changing epidemiology of cancers as
the population ages. This has been done in several studies
in the USA [1,13]; however, research in the European population
is needed.
The burden of non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADMs)
is now surpassing that of ADMs in HIV-positive people in
the USA and Europe [1,13]. Furthermore, some NADMs
occur more frequently than ADMs in HIV-positive people;
for example, more cases of anal cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma
are diagnosed than invasive cervical cancer [1,14].
For these reasons, recent research has shifted towards
defining malignancies as infection-related malignancies
(IRMs) and infection-unrelated malignancies (IURMs) [8].
The changing epidemiology of malignancies and the
impact of aging on cancer incidence need to be better
characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the
impact of aging in HIV-positive people on the incidence
of IRMs and IURMs within EuroSIDA, a large European
cohort of HIV-positive people with a long follow-up period,
and to estimate the likely impact of IRMs and IURMs
in the HIV-positive population in the next 5 years for
future health care planning, treatment and prevention.
Patients and methods
The EuroSIDA study
EuroSIDA is a prospective observational open cohort of
18 587 HIV-1-positive patients in 108 centres across 33
European countries, Israel and Argentina (details at
www.cphiv.dk). Patients were enrolled into nine cohorts
from May 1994 and informed consent was obtained from
all patients. All information is prospectively collected via
standardized forms which are completed by personnel at
the sites at the time of enrolment and every 6 months
thereafter. The forms collect basic demographic, clinical
and laboratory data, including all CD4 counts and HIV
viral loads (HIV-VLs), starting and stopping dates of all
antiretroviral drugs, smoking status, and dates and diagnoses
of all new AIDS-defining diagnoses [using the
1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
clinical definition [15], which includes ADMs] since last
follow-up. In 2001, the standardized forms were updated
to collect data on all new non-AIDS-defining diagnoses
identified by clinical diagnosis or autopsy (including
NADMs) [16], allowing the sites to report date of diagnosis,
method of diagnosis (definitive, presumptive or
autopsy), and location (selected from a list of common
malignancies or as free text). All reported AIDS-defining
and non-AIDS-defining malignancies were source verified
against case notes at the sites by members of the coordinating
office to ensure data accuracy, as well as for all
other major clinical events and a random sample of 10%
of all other patients. Loss to follow-up in EuroSIDA is
< 5% per 100 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) and is
consistent over time [17].
Inclusion criteria
All subjects enrolled in EuroSIDA with prospective follow-
up after 1 January 2001 were included in the study.
Patients were followed from the later of the first visit or
1 January 2001 until the last visit or death. The median
date of the last visit was March 2012 [interquartile range
(IQR) August 2009 to June 2012].
All malignancies, both AIDS-defining and non-AIDSdefining,
diagnosed during the follow-up period were
included and classified using the International Classification
of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition
code classification system [18]. Multiple
malignancies per person were included; however, preexisting
cancers, secondary diagnoses, metastasis, reoccurrence
of the same malignancy type, pre-cancers and
nonmelanoma skin cancers were excluded. IRMs were
defined as all malignancies with a probably infectious
cause: Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) [caused by human herpesvirus-
8 (HHV8)], non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (caused by EpsteinBarr virus
(EBV)], invasive cervical cancers (ICCs), and selected
malignancies of the head and neck (base of tongue, pharynx
and tonsils), anus, penis, vulva and vagina [caused
by human papilloma virus (HPV)], liver [caused by hepatitis
B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)] and
stomach (caused by Helicobactor pylori [H.Pylori] [19].
All remaining malignancies were defined as IURMs.
Statistical methods
Poisson generalized estimating equations assuming
autoregressive (AR1) correlation were used to estimate
the association between age and IRM and IURM incidence.
Models were adjusted for the following baseline

Malignancies, infection and aging in HIV 591
variables: ethnicity, region, gender, mode of transmission
[homosexual, male injecting drug user (IDU), female IDU,
male heterosexual, female heterosexual or missing] and
body mass index (BMI); they were also adjusted for the
following time-updated variables: age, calendar year,
smoking status (current, previous, never or missing), current
HIV-VL plasma level, CD4 cell count, prior HBV
[prior positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) test or presence
of detectable HBV DNA] and HCV (prior positive
HCV surface antibody test or presence of detectable HCV
RNA) coinfection, prior diagnoses of ADMs, NADMs,
AIDS-defining events (excluding ADMs) and non-AIDSdefining
events (defined as cardiovascular, end-stage
renal disease, liver failure and pancreatitis, excluding
NADMs) [16], cART use (antiretroviral regimen containing
at least three drugs from any class), and regimen according
to intention to treat [protease inhibitor (PI)- or nonnucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based].
It was decided a priori to stratify associations of IRMs
and IURMs with CD4 cell count and smoking status by
age (< 50 and ≥ 50 years) because of strong associations
with both age and cancer risk. Interactions between age
and all other variables were also investigated.
The proportions of excess malignancies within our
cohort attributable to each significant modifiable factor
and age were calculated using an internally valid version
of the population attributable risk in the presence of confounding
[20]. This is interpreted as the percentage of
excess malignancies attributable to each factor relative to
a reference category, within the cohort.
Future crude IRM and IURM biannual incidence was
forecast using linear exponential smoothing models,
stratified by baseline age group (< 50 and ≥ 50 years),
CD4 count (< 350 and ≥ 350 cells/lL), HIV risk group
and smoking status. Forecasts were restricted to those
enrolled prior to 2001. This ensures a stable population
over time (i.e. no new recruitments); however, people
were allowed to leave the cohort (because of death or loss
to follow-up). No further adjustments for covariates were
made.
All statistical tests were two-sided and the type I error
rate was 5%. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Characteristics
A total of 15 648 persons contributed 95 033 PYFU with
a median follow-up time of 6.0 [interquartile range (IQR)
2.5, 10.7] years. Baseline characteristics according to
malignancy status are shown in Table 1. At baseline,
16.0% of patients were aged ≥ 50 years, 72.6% of the
population were male, 88.3% were of white ethnic origin
and 38.7% of men were infected with HIV through homosexual
exposure. Approximately one-third of patients
were current smokers and one-third had never smoked.
The median CD4 count at baseline was 410 (IQR 265,
588) cells/lL, with 14.8% having a CD4 count ≤ 200
cells/lL, and HIV-VL was 123 (IQR < 50, 5200) HIV-1
RNA copies/mL, with 54.5% having HIV-VL ≤ 400
copies/mL. Prior AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining
events were present in 24.4% and 1.9% of patients,
respectively. Coinfection with HCV and HBV was prevalent
in 23.1% and 5.5% of people, respectively.
A total of 610 people developed 643 malignancies, of
which 60.3% were IRMs and the remaining 39.7% were
IURMs (Table 2). The most common IRMs were NHL
(n = 116), anal cancer (85), KS (62) and HL (43). Lung
(n = 55), prostate (28), colorectal (23) and breast (22) cancers
were common IURMs. At diagnosis, those who developed
IURMs relative to those who developed IRMs were
older [median age 54 (IQR 46, 61) years for IURMs vs. 46
(IQR 39, 52) years for IRMs] and had a higher CD4 count
[median 446 (IQR 295, 608) cells/lL vs. 342 (IQR 182,
546) years, respectively] and a lower HIV-VL [median
< 50 (IQR < 50, 86) copies/mL vs. 61 (IQR < 50, 20 002)
copies/mL, respectively]. A lower proportion of those with
IURMs had prior HCV coinfection and the proportions of
those with prior HBV coinfection were similar. Proportions
of ever smokers with IRMs (45%) and IURMS (46%)
were similar. The majority of cancers diagnosed in those
younger than 50 years (n = 353 cancers) were IRMs
(75%), with EBV related malignancies accounting for 31%
of IRMs and HPV related malignancies accounting for
25%. In those aged ≥ 50 years (290 cancers), more than
half had IURMs (57%), with lung cancer accounting for
13% of IURMs and prostate cancer accounting for 10%.
Adjusted incidence of IRM and IURM
In adjusted models, those aged ≥ 50 years had a 1.62
(95% CI 1.14, 2.30) times higher IRM incidence compared
with those aged 36–40 years (Table 3), corresponding to
a 17% higher incidence per 10 years older age (adjusted
rate ratio (aRR) 1.17; 95% CI 1.05, 1.32). The percentage
of excess IRMs attributable to being aged ≥ 51 years
compared with 36–40 years was 12%. Factors strongly
related to a high IRM incidence were HIV associated.
Specifically, HIV-VL > 400 copies/mL was associated
with a higher IRM incidence (aRR 1.84; 95% CI 1.39,
2.43; P < 0.01) and accounted for 19% of excess malig-

nancies, relative to those with well-controlled viraemia
(HIV-VL ≤ 400 copies/mL). A lower current CD4 cell
count was associated with a higher IRM incidence
(Table 3), which was similar in those aged < 50 years and
≥ 50 years (Fig. 1c; P interaction = 0.82). CD4 counts
< 200 and 200–349 cells/lL accounted for 21% and 11%
of excess IRMs, respectively (Table 3), relative to those
with a CD4 count of ≥ 500 cells/lL. There was no association
between IRM incidence and current smoking
(Table 3) in younger or older people (Fig. 1d; P for interaction
= 0.31). Prior HBV coinfection was associated with
a higher IRM incidence (aRR 1.70; 95% CI 1.24, 2.32),
but only 5% of IRMs were attributable to HBV coinfection
within the cohort (Table 3).
The IURM incidence was 7.33-fold (95% CI 4.07,
13.21; P < 0.01) and 2.37-fold (95% CI 1.31, 4.27;
P < 0.01) higher in those aged ≥ 51 years and aged 41–
50 years compared with those aged 36–40 years
(Table 3), and explained 56% and 17% of excess IURMs
within the cohort, respectively. This corresponds to a
twofold increase in IURM incidence per 10 years older
age (aRR 2.07; 95% CI 1.84, 2.32). Current smoking was

Malignancies, infection and aging in HIV 593
associated with elevated IURM incidence and explained
16% of IURMs overall. Stratifying by age, IURMs were
elevated in current smokers relative to nonsmokers in
those aged ≥ 50 years (aRR 1.75; 95% CI 1.23, 4.49;
P < 0.01; Fig. 1b), but not in those aged < 50 years
(aRR 1.12; 95% CI 0.71, 1.77; P = 0.51), although the Pvalue
of the interaction term was nonsignificant
(P = 0.32). Current smoking was not associated with
IURM incidence after the exclusion of lung cancers. A
low current CD4 count was associated with a higher
IURM incidence (CD4 count < 200 cells/lL: aRR 1.99;
95% CI 1.26, 3.17; P < 0.01, relative to CD4 count
> 500 cells/lL). Despite this, the overall excess of IURMs
attributable to a CD4 count < 200 cells/lL (6%) was
small. The association between higher IURM incidence
and low CD4 count was evident in those aged
< 50 years (aRR 2.52; 95% CI 1.40, 4.54; P = 0.01;
Fig. 1a), but not in those aged ≥ 50 years (aRR 1.14;
95% CI 0.62, 2.12; P = 0.56; Fig. 1a), although the Pvalue
of the interaction term did not reach statistical
significance (P = 0.09). Prior HBV coinfection was also
associated with higher IURM incidence (aRR 1.73; 95%
CI 1.17, 2.55; P < 0.01), but only 5% were attributable
to HBV coinfection within the cohort (Table 3).
Future incidence
There were 6111 people enrolled prior to 1 January 2001,
contributing 54 030 PYFU [median of 11.1 (IQR 5.8–11.3)
PYFU per person] who developed 243 IRMs and 161
IURMs during follow-up. At baseline, 82% of patients
were aged < 50 years, 78% were male and 41% had a
CD4 count < 350 cells/lL. Forty-seven per cent were
homosexual, 25% were heterosexual and 21% were IDUs.
Twenty-six per cent were smokers at baseline, 21% were
nonsmokers at baseline and 52% had unknown smoking
status.
Assuming current trends continue, the crude IRM incidence
for those recruited before 2001 was forecast to
decline from an incidence of 3.1 (95% CI 1.5, 5.9)/1000
PYFU in July to December 2011 to 2.2 (95% CI 0.9, 4.3)/
1000 PYFU after 5 years (Fig. 2a). This was consistent in
all strata, with the exception of IDUs, in whom the incidence
was stable (Table 4). The forecasted crude IURM
incidence increased from 4.1 (95% CI 2.2, 7.2)/1000 PYFU
in July to December 2011 to 5.9 (95% CI 3.2, 10.2)/1000
PYFU after 5 years (Fig. 2b), and was consistent in all
strata, except in never smokers for whom the IURM incidence
was forecast to decrease from 1.7 (95% CI 0.0,
10.6)/1000 PYFU in July to December 2011 to 0.8 (95%
CI 0.0, 7.0)/1000 PYFU after 5 years (Table 4). The incidence
of IURMs surpassed that of IRMs from January to
June 2009 onwards, and was forcast to continue to
increase over the subsequent 5 years.
Discussion
Demographic and HIV-related risk factors for IURMs and
IRMs differ markedly. The incidence of IURMs has
exceeded that of IRMs since JanuaryJune 2009 (in
those enrolled in EuroSIDA prior to 2001) and the contribution
from IURMs is forecast to increase over the
subsequent 5 years as a result of aging of the HIV-positive
population, a high smoking prevalence [4], and a
low prevalence of untreated and advanced HIV infection.
These findings suggest the need to develop targeted preventive
measures and evaluate the costbenefit of
screening for IURMs in HIV-positive populations. Ours is
one of the few large prospective studies in a European
population with free access to care. The majority of the
research to date has focussed largely on patients within
the USA.
A higher IRM incidence was strongly associated with
traditional HIV factors such as a higher HIV-VL and a
lower CD4 cell count and, to a lesser extent, older age.
The incidence of IRMs steadily increased with lower CD4
count category. However, the proportions of IRMs attributable
to older age, higher HIV-VL and lower CD4 count
were similar to each other in EuroSIDA, as a result of
ongoing aging and a low prevalence of uncontrolled HIV
infection in this cohort. Those aged ≥ 51 years may have

had longer exposure to oncogenic viruses, which could
explain the increased IRM incidence.
Older age was the largest contributor to IURM incidence.
Our finding of a twofold higher IURM incidence
for a 10-year increase in age is similar to findings of the
The Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy
(SMART) study [24] and to data published online by the
European Cancer Observatory, which showed a 1.9-fold
increase in the incidence of all malignancies in the general
population [23]. The effects of aging, including
reduced immune function, are thought to be accelerated
in HIV-positive populations and may also contribute to
an increased IURM incidence [22].
Current smoking status was associated with a higher
IURM incidence, driven by lung cancer, in people aged
≥ 50 years, probably reflecting the lag time between
smoking and the onset of consequences. As the proportion
of the cohort aged over 50, 60 and 70 years increases, the
relative impact of characteristics associated with IURM
risk is likely to continue to shift, highlighting the need for
ongoing monitoring of the changing epidemiology of
malignancies. This is a comparatively new research area
in HIV infection and large, well-designed observational
studies are crucial to understand both existing and emerging
comorbidities in HIV-positive people. A higher IURM
incidence was associated with a CD4 cell count < 200
cells/lL in people aged < 50 years only, which appeared
to be attributable to a relatively high number of lung cancers
in this group. However, numbers were small and further
investigation was not possible.
The incidence of IRMs was forecast to decline over
time, probably driven by the low prevalence of advanced

Malignancies, infection and aging in HIV 595
and untreated HIV infection, following improvements in
treatment efficacy, uptake and adherence. Antiretroviral
therapy controls HIV viraemia, leading to CD4 recovery,
and reduces the risk of some IRMs, such as KS and NHL
[1,11,13,14,25], but not all (e.g. HL, ICC and anal cancers)
[11,25–27]. This was consistent in all strata except IDUs,
who are less likely to be on treatment and have poorer
outcomes. The incidence of IURMs was forecast to gradually
increase in the near future, driven by aging of the
HIV-positive population. The only exception was in nonsmokers,
reflecting lower lung cancer rates and further
supporting the need for cessation programmes. The
malignancy incidence in an American study was projected
to increase by approximately 45% between 2010
and 2030, driven by malignant diagnoses in older age
groups in the general population [28]. A similar result
was found for the UK population [21].
This study has a number of limitations. EuroSIDA has
a relatively large number of prospectively collected
source validated malignancies, but, despite this, the frequencies
of individual malignancies were small and could
not be investigated or forecasted individually. Furthermore,
this is an observational study and residual
confounding cannot be ruled out. The predicted small
increase in IURMs may be influenced by changes in and
uptake of cancer screening practices, such as cervical,
breast, colorectal and prostate screening, in clinics. However,
no significant changes in the incidence of these
cancers occurred in our study, although numbers were
small. EuroSIDA does not routinely collect data on
screening practices and therefore we cannot investigate
the role of screening further. However, recent survey data
on HIV management in active EuroSIDA sites found that
screening rates for cervical and anorectal cancers were
low [29]. Linear exponential smoothing models are a simple
method of forecasting which assumes the continuation
of previous population trends. A limited amount of
historical data was available for forecasting, contributing
to uncertainty around forecasts. HIV-specific population
projections are not currently available, which prevents
the use of more advanced methodologies, such as ageperiod-
cohort models.
As the HIV-infected population ages, the incidence of
IURMs is expected to increase as a result of aging of the
HIV-infected population and the high prevalence of lung
cancer caused by smoking, the effects of which generally

manifest with longer term exposure and thus at older
ages. Conversely, IRM incidence is expected to decline as
a result of the low prevalence of advanced and untreated
HIV infection and severe immunodeficiency. IURMs
should therefore be a priority in the coming years as
higher proportions of HIV-positive people live past 50, 60
