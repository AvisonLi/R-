Abstract
Purpose – The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries are facing
unprecedented challenges related to climate change and population aging. The purpose of the analysis is to
explore the relationship between population aging and environmental degradation, accounting for human
capital, using a sample of 19 OECD countries over the period 1980–2019.
Design/methodology/approach – On the empirical methodology, the analysis uses panel estimators with
heterogenous coefficients and an error structure that takes into consideration cross-country heterogeneity and
cross-sectional dependence for a panel of 19 OECD countries over the period 1980–2019. To examine the
relationship between population aging and environmental degradation, the authors employ two alternative
measures of environmental degradation that is energy consumption and CO2 emissions in metric tons per
capita. Concerning the regressors, the authors account for two alternative aging indicators, namely the elderly
population and the old-age dependency ratios to confirm robustness.
Findings – The analysis provides evidence that population aging and human capital development (IHC) lead
to lower energy consumption in the OECD sample. Overall, the growing number of elderly people in the OECD
seems to act as a mitigating factor for energy consumption. The authors view these results as conveying the
message that the evolution of population aging along with channeling government expenditures towards
human capital enhancement are important drivers of curbing energy consumption and ensuring environmental
sustainability. The authors’ research is of great significance for environmental policymakers by illuminating
the favorable energy consumption patterns that population aging brings to advanced economies.
Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of this study concerns data availability. Future
research, and subject to greater data availability in the future, could dig deeper into understanding the dynamics
of this complex nexus by incorporating additional control variables. Similarly, the authors focus on aggregate
renewable energy consumption, and the authors do not explicitly model the sources of renewable energy (wind,
hydropower, solar power, solid biofuels and other). Additional analysis of the breakdown of renewable energy
sourceswould be insightful – subject to data availability – especially formeeting the recently agreed new target of
42.5% for European Union (EU) countries by 2030. A deep transformation of the European energy system is
needed for the EU tomeet the target. Finally, extending the model to include a range of non-OECD countries that
are also experiencing demographic transformations is a promising avenue for future research.
Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects of
population aging and human capital on environmental degradation using a broad set of OECD countries and
advanced spectrumestimationmethods. Given cross-sectional dependencies and cross-country heterogeneity, the
authors’ empirical results underline the importance of cross-OECD policy spillovers and knowledge diffusions
across the OECD countries. The new “energy culture” calls for concerted policy action even in an aging era.

1. Introduction
Population aging and the more palpable risk of climate action failure constitute major
challenges for advanced economies. It is beyond any doubt that energy is fundamental in our
modern societies for both households and enterprises. However, the world is facing a severe
climate emergency. Bold action is needed to address climate change risks and meet the goals
of the Paris Agreement to reach zero-net emissions by 2025. To achieve this, we need to alter
our conventional way of thinking about energy and, ultimately, minimize our reliance on
fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy. This feeling is also shared by the latest
United Nations Environment Programme Annual Report (UNEP, 2022). Concurrently,
population aging is at the heart of modern economies and may have an impact on energy
consumption and the emissions level. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22%
between 2015 and 2050 (WHO, 2022). Such a shift in the distribution of a country’s population
towards older ages is more prominent in advanced economies but developing countries are
now experiencing a similar change. At this unique confluence of risks, the notion of human
capital takes centre stage. While the debate on what lessons does this era offer for
policymakers is still open, it is clear that human capital development (IHC) has an important
role to play in enhancing a proper understanding of the demographic patterns and drivers of
environmental degradation. Nonetheless, we know very little about the linkages among
demographic, educational, economic and environmental variables. Our paper aims to fill
this gap.
In most recent empirical analyses, uncovering the relevant drivers of climate change
mitigation remains one of the most controversial and urgent issues. As to whether population
aging can lead to lower energy consumption, many authors have put forth different views
(Estiri and Zagheni, 2019; Pais-Magalh~aes et al., 2020, 2022; Yaziz et al., 2022). Still,
the challenge of population aging on economic degradation remains unclear. From
one standpoint, studies suggest that aging can enhance carbon emission and therefore
contribute to environmental degradation as the elderly tend to have consumed more energy
intensive goods and services. However, other studies point out to a negative effect of the
elderly on energy consumption as they tend to be more environmentally friendly (Yang and
Wang, 2020). Recently, the effect of human capital enhancement on combatting
environmental degradation is examined (Opoku et al., 2022; Shahbaz et al., 2022).
The relationship between human capital and environmental degradation points to a
negative relationship as societies with more human capital tend to be more environmentally
cautious consuming less energy (Hondroyiannis et al., 2022). Still, little is known about the
impact of population aging on energy consumption and carbon emissions controlling for
human capital accumulation. Ignoring this impact remains an important drawback in
empirical literature. Our paper contributes to empirical literature by exploring the
relationship between population aging and environmental degradation, accounting for
human capital, with the use of a sample of 19 OECD countries over the period 1980–2019.
In other words, we move beyond the extant focus of empirical analysis to account for
currently pressing issues for policymakers. To shed further light on this relationship, we
employ two alternative measures of environmental degradation that is energy consumption
and CO2 emissions in metric tons per capita. Concerning the regressors and further to the
impact of human capital, we account for two alternative aging indicators, namely the elderly
population and the old-age dependency ratios to confirm robustness. Our data along with a
novel empirical approach to studying this link, allows us to make use of panel estimators with
heterogenous coefficients and an error structure that takes into consideration cross-country
heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. This offers a new tool for accounting for the
presence of various sources of heterogeneity among countries (the OECD is composed of an
heterogeneous group of countries), such as cross-country variations in economic structures

and governance, as well as potential common effects among countries, such as advances in
research and development programs, human capital expenditures, retirement policies,
advances in energy saving methods, that are considered by introducing non-zero error
variances in the panel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to
examine the effects of population aging and human capital on environmental degradation
using a broad set of OECD countries and advanced spectrum estimation methods, leading us
to clarify how several potential explanatory factors impact on environmental degradation.
To get a flavor of the empirical findings of our analysis we provide evidence that
population aging and IHC lead to lower energy consumption in the OECD sample. We view
these results as conveying the message that the evolution of population aging along with
channeling government expenditures towards human capital enhancement are important
drivers of curbing energy consumption and ensuring environmental sustainability.
Our findings extend our understanding on the role of population aging in preventing
environmental degradation and remain robust to sensitivity checks. At the same time, our
modeling approach allows us to control for IHC and connect results from the aging/human
capital literature with the recently flourishing literature on climate change and environmental
sustainability.
The remainder of this analysis is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical
and empirical evidence on the effects of population aging and human capital on sustainable
development. Section 3 presents the methodology and describes the data. Section 4 presents
the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.
2. Population aging, human capital and sustainable development: a brief
literature review
The role of population aging on macroeconomic outcomes, such as inflation, output, labor
force participation, is only until recently that has been studied extensively (Papapetrou and
Tsalaporta, 2020). However, the effect of population aging on carbon emissions and in
particular environmental degradation has not been studied considerably and the research
outcome remains inconclusive.
The impact of population aging on economic degradation remains incomplete and some
studies support the notion of a positive influence on carbon emissions and others point out to
a negative impact (Yang and Wang, 2020; Yang et al., 2021). The basic idea behind the
positive influence of population aging on economic degradation stems from the fact that
elderly people tend to consume more energy intensive goods and services thus triggering
higher level of carbon emissions. At the same time, an aging population combined with a
declining share of youths tend to raise the pressure on environmental degradation. On the
other hand, elderly tend to adopt consumption and income styles and patterns that support
pro-environment actions that are favoring a low-carbon model and thus fostering lower
environmental footprints.
Studies accounting for population aging have used different population indicators
(Zhang and Tan, 2016; Yang et al., 2021). One strand of literature focuses on population
growth (Knapp and Mookerjee, 1996). The study utilizing a cointegration framework
examined the nexus between global population growth and CO2 emissions to support a
short-term dynamic relationship between them. Other studies combine population
age-structures and cohort effects to examine their impact on carbon emissions
(Menz and Welsch, 2012; Zhang and Tan, 2016). The analysis provides evidence of a
positive impact on aging population on carbon emissions. Zhang and Tan (2016) account
for a pool of disaggregated population factors, such as population intensity, population
growth, population quality and population age-structure to examine their effect on carbon
emissions in China provinces over the period 1997–2012.

Many studies have documented that the impact of population aging on carbon emissions
is related to the state of development of the examined countries. In a seminal work, Shi (2003)
using a pool of 93 countries over the period 1975–1996 shows that population’s change is
more than proportionally related with rising carbon emissions, and this effect is more
significant in developing countries than in developed countries. Menz and Welsch (2012)
employing a panel of 26 countries over the period 1060–2005 and including in the estimation
age (life cycle) and cohort composition effects suggest that both life cycle and cohort
outcomes have positively affected carbon emissions in OECD countries. Zhang and Tan
(2016) utilized population factors to account for their effect on carbon emission at the national
and regional levels. Their analysis reveals a positive effect of population aging and
population quality on carbon emissions at the national level whereas there exist differences at
the urban-rural level and at the regional level. Recently, Wang and Wang (2021) using data
from 2002 to 2012 for 137 countries or regions examine the nonlinear effects of population
aging on carbon emissions. They employ panel threshold regression methodology and show
that an increase in the level of population aging, the industrial structure and urbanization
results in higher levels of carbon emissions but the findings are sensitive to the countries
under different levels of development.
As for the relationship between population aging, human capital and carbon emissions,
four models have been utilized in the environmental literature to examine the nexus between
population aging, human capital and energy consumption (Menz and Welsch, 2012; Yang
et al., 2021; Hondroyiannis et al., 2022). The Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis
(Grossman and Krueger, 1991) suggests that there is an inverted U-shaped association
between output and environmental degradation in the form of energy consumption
and/or CO2 emissions. This suggests that as the country advances, environmental expansion
reverses CO2 emissions that are high in the early faces of economic development.
The pollution heaven hypothesis (PHH) links environmental deterioration and openness in
the environmental literature. The PHH suggests policies adopted by international companies
initially point to low cost options in terms of resources and labor input that results in a of
environmental quality. The pollution halo hypothesis suggests that companies from
advanced countries by implementing environmentally friendly production processes and
following eco-friendly environmental framework can result in reductions of CO2 emissions in
the host country. Lastly, in line with the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population,
Affluence and technology (STIRPAT) model basis it is population, affluence and technology
that impose an environmental footprint on the economy.
In that framework, many researchers have identified of a negative relationship between
human capital and energy consumption. The evidence is ample for studies using micro data
(Broadstock et al., 2016; Steenblik, 2006; Salim et al., 2017). Broadstock et al. (2016) and
Steenblik (2006) show that households with higher human capital in China are more energyefficient
consuming less energy as they have access to more efficient technologies.
Employing Chinese provincial data over the period 1990–2021 Salim et al. (2017) found a
negative association among human capital and energy consumption and have attributed this
finding to post-school human capital.
However, at an aggregate-macro level the relationship between human capital, energy
consumption and CO2 emissions is not unanimous. A plausible explanation is that human
capital as it produces growth-enhancing effects in the economy may increase energy
consumption, but on the other hand may result in energy preservation effects. In this manner,
Huang et al. (2008) document an inverse relationship between human capital and energy
consumption for high income countries and a positive relationship for low-income countries
for a panel of 82 countries from 1972 to 2002. For a panel of Asian Pacific countries for 1970–
2011 and employing a human capital index as measured by the years of schooling Fang and
Chang (2016) support the presence of a long-run relationship among economic growth,

human capital and energy consumption. They justify their findings as they suggest that
strengthening human capital investment supports the research and development of new
energy-efficient technologies. Yao et al. (2019) account for clean and dirty energy
consumption for a panel of OECD countries over the period 1965–2014 to find that human
capital decreases dirty energy consumption and increases clean energy consumption after
controlling for energy prices, capital, research and development and labor market
institutions. Also, Yao et al. (2020) using data for a panel of 20 OECD counties over an
1870–2014 find that human capital is associated with reductions in CO2 emissions.
Hondroyiannis et al. (2022) using data for 19 OECD countries with advance expenditures
in education show that human capital advancement is robustly associated with reduction in
CO2 emissions, a finding that is robust across the energy consumption distribution.
Opoku et al. (2022) use data for OECD countries over the period 1996–2016 to examine the
impact of human development on environmental degradation and show that progress in
human development ensures environmental sustainability. Recently, Chondrogianni and
Tsalaporta (2023) using a data from 14 developing countries with a large share of carbon
emissions over the period 1980–2019 examine the role of human capital on mitigating
environmental deterioration. The results show that human capital progress is strongly
associated with reductions in CO2 emissions.
Despite of the richness of empirical approaches on accounting for the effects of population
aging or human capital on environmental degradation, to the best of our knowledge, the
relationship between population aging on economic degradation accounting for human
capital has been overlooked in the literature. Our paper contributes to this shortcoming by
deriving policy prescriptions in the presence of such a relationship.
3. Methodology and data
3.1 Empirical model
Our panel consists of 19 OECD countries, over the period 1980–2019, based on data
availability. The selected country group not only stands out for the level of human capital and
the environmental consciousness but is also characterized by a rise in the share of the older
people mainly resulting from longer life expectancy [1]. Demographic developments and
human capital advancement can both play a key role in averting environmental degradation.
The sample countries, with an aging population, higher human capital and greater
environmental awareness achieve better environmental outcomes (Yang et al., 2021;
Alvarado et al., 2021). We employ two variables as proxies for environmental degradation,
energy consumption and CO2 emissions, to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the relationship between population aging, human capital and sustainable
development. Government expenditure per student (as percentage of gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita) is used as proxy for human capital to provide an in-depth look at the muchneeded
climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in the OECD.
Following the aforementioned empirical strategy and a combination of theories, i.e. the
EKC and PHH hypotheses and new growth theories and a set of control variables that
account for omitted variable bias, our model is specified as follows:
energyit ¼ a1 þ β1ageit þ β2HCit þ β3GDPrealitþβ4oilpriceit þ β5openit þ Uit (1)
co2emit ¼ a1 þ β1ageit þ β2HCit þ β3GDPrealitþβ4oilpriceit þ β5openit þ Uit (2)
where ageit captures either the elderly ratio (elderlyit) or the old-age dependency ratio (oldageit)
of country i at time t and βi denote coefficients to be estimated. HCit is the human capital index,
GDPrealit is GDP per capita, oilpriceit denotes crude oil import prices, openit is the economic
openness measure and Uit is the error term. All variables enter the regressions in logarithmic

form. It is assumed that the regressors are uncorrelated with the disturbance term Uit.
However, the disturbances themselves are allowed to be autocorrelated, heteroskedastic and
cross-sectionally dependent. All variables used in equations (1) and (2) are explained below.
3.2 Econometric methodology
Using advanced spectrum estimation methods, we estimate equations (1) and (2) to explore
the relationship between population aging, human capital and environmental degradation.
Building on traditional fixed effects (FE) panel estimators, we go one step further and allow
the slope coefficients to differ across panel members by using the mean group (MG) estimator
that implements a panel time-series estimator, allowing for heterogeneous slope coefficients
across group members and cross-sectional dependence (Eberhardt, 2012). To estimate effects
in a large heterogeneous panel data model with cross-sectional dependence and slope
heterogeneity, we employ the newly developed (Dynamic) Common Correlated Effects Model
(DCCE) proposed by Ditzen (2019).
This works satisfactorily for static and dynamic models. The variances are calculated
using the delta method. In contrast to the MG estimation, DCCE partials out the crosssectional
means internally to account for dependencies between units. The cross-sectional
means approximate the unobserved common factors between units. On top of the inclusion of
the cross-sectional averages, there is another important difference; MG calculates the
coefficients using maximum likelihood while DCCE estimates our equation entirely by
ordinary least squares (OLS) using common correlated effects. This recently developed
econometric approach upgrades statistical inference in the estimation of heterogeneous
coefficient models in panels with a large number of observations over country groups and
time periods, as is the case in our model.
3.3 Data
The dataset covers annual frequency data for a panel of 19 advanced countries from 1980 to
2019, based on data availability. Variables employed in the analysis are sourced from the
World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) and the OECD databases. All variables are
in logarithmic form. Variables expressed in natural logarithms are denoted by l in the
regression output. Dependent variables include the following indicators: Energy
consumption is measured as energy use in kg of oil equivalent per capita (energy) and
proxies for overall environmental pollution in a country. An alternative measure of
environmental degradation is CO2 emissions in metric tons per capita (co2em). Carbon
dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of
cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid and gas
fuels and gas flaring. Monitoring and mitigating carbon emissions is one of the key aspects of
the Paris Agreement on climate change. Independent variables cover a broad set of policy
areas and include the following indicators: The elderly population is defined as people aged
65 and over (elderly) measured as a percentage of population. It is a key variable in the
analysis. A higher elderly ratio is expected to be negatively associated with energy
consumption. Another demographic indicator employed in the analysis is the old-age
dependency ratio (oldage) that is defined as the number of individuals aged 65 and over per
100 people of working age defined as those at ages 20 to 64. The evolution of old-age to
working-age ratios depends on mortality rates, fertility rates and migration. Turning to
human capital variables, the human capital index (HC) is based on government expenditure
per student, tertiary (% of GDP per capita) and is expected to be negatively associated with
energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The choice of this variable offers a better insight
into the role of policy making in promoting sustainable development. GDP per capita as
constant 2010 US dollars (GDPreal) is employed as a proxy for income effects. Growing per
JES
51,2
476
capita GDP will most likely lead to increasing energy consumption and carbon dioxide
emissions. To account for energy price developments, we employ crude oil import prices (oil).
Crude oil import prices come from the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Crude Oil Import
Register and are influenced not only by traditional movements of supply and demand, but
also by other factors such as geopolitics. Information is collected from national agencies
according to the type of crude oil, by geographic origin and by quality of crude. Values are
recorded at the time of import and include cost, insurance and freight, but exclude import
duties. This indicator is measured in USD per barrel of oil. It is expected to be negatively
associated with energy consumption and carbon emissions. We also control for economic
openness measure (open). Calculated as the sum of exports (exports) and imports (imports) of
goods and services as a percentage of GDP, economic openness is a key indicator of a
country’s integration into the world economy. It is expected to lead to a decrease in energy
demand by enabling countries to import advanced energy supply technologies, which could
eventually lower energy intensity. Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the dependent
and independent variables employed in the analysis.
4. Empirical results
4.1 Preliminary tests
In this section, various specification tests are employed to verify that the empirical model is
correctly specified, taking into consideration the sample of 19OECDcountries. First, to estimate
the impact of human capital on environmental degradation, we begin by employing the
Pesaran’s cross-sectional dependence (CD) test to examine the existence of cross-sectional
dependence in the panel due to increasing integration of countries and to strong
interdependencies among them (De Hoyos and Sarafidis, 2006). Disregarding the existence of
sufficient cross-sectional dependence in the data that is ignored in the estimation,may well lead
to estimation biases. The Pesaran CD-test shows that the null hypothesis of cross-sectional
independence is rejected as, on average, the (absolute) correlation between the residuals of
OECDcountries is 0.526 forModel Ia, 0.515 forModel Ib, 0.445 forModel IIa and 0.447 for Model
IIb (Table 2). Model Ia denotes specifications where energy consumption is the dependent

where energy consumption is the dependent variable and the old-age dependency ratio is
employed as a control variable. Model IIa denotes specifications where CO2 emissions is the
dependent variable and the elderly ratio is employed as a control variable. Model IIb denotes
specifications where CO2 emissions is the dependent variable and the old-age dependency ratio
is employed as a control variable. As can be drawn from Table 2, we additionally perform the
Friedman’s test for the presence of cross-sectional dependence that provides similar results as
those of the Pesaran’s CD test. The existence of cross-sectional dependence is confirmed.
To choose the model that best fits in the sample, as a second step, we employ the slope
homogeneity test of Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) to check whether heterogeneity exists
across countries for the analyzed dataset. Using Monte Carlo experiments, the adjusted
(Delta-adjusted: Δadj) version of the dispersion test has the correct size and satisfactory
power in panels with exogenous regressors for various combinations of N and T, irrespective
of whether the errors are normally distributed or not. The results of the slope homogeneity
test, as shown in Table 2 (Delta and Delta-adjusted), show that the delta test statistic is
sufficiently large to reject the null of slope homogeneity, pointing to the heterogeneity of the
slope coefficients.
Third, having verified that the data are cross-sectionally dependent and slope coefficients
are heterogeneous, we run the cross-sectional augmented Dickey-Fuller second-generation
unit root test proposed by Pesaran (2007) in the context of heterogeneous panels with crosssectional
dependence and slope heterogeneity (PESCADF test). Results generally indicate
evidence against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. The PESCADF tests ensures that
the series are stationary (Table 3).

4.2 Empirical results
Following up on the overview of preliminary tests’ results, we estimate the relationship
between explanatory and dependent variables using the most recently developed estimation
methods. Table 4 presents the average (mean) energy consumption (Model I) (columns 1, 3, 5
and 7) and CO2 emissions coefficients (Model II) (columns 2, 4, 6 and 8) under MG
(columns 1–4) and DCCE estimators (columns 5–8) for panel data. The MG estimates
overcome the presence of slope heterogeneity in large panels. The DCCE estimates account
not only for slope heterogeneity but also for cross-sectional dependence. Under the DCCE
estimator, we partial out the cross-sectional averages of the dependent variables (energy
consumption and CO2 emissions) internally to account for dependencies between countries
manifesting as unobserved common factors. To ensure robustness, we employ two
alternative aging indicators, that is the elderly population (lelderly) and the old-age
dependency ratios (loldage).
Results show that population aging mitigates environmental degradation. Other studies
have also confirmed this view (Yang et al., 2021; Yaziz et al., 2022). We observe this pattern
irrespective of the aging indicator employed as a control variable. The increase in the elderly
population (lelderly) and in the old-age dependency ratio (loldage) have a noticeable negative
effect on energy consumption (lenergy) (columns 1, 3, 5 and 7), a finding which is consistent
over different estimation methods. Their impact on CO2 emissions (lco2em) is statistically
significant though solely under theMGestimator (columns 2 and 4). The main reason for that
is the energy consumption patterns of the elderly which tend to be more low-carbon and
environmentally friendly than the younger generations. In particular, the elderly tend to use
less electricity due to decreased reliance on energy consuming home appliances (such as
washing machines, fridges, consumer electronics, kitchen appliances) relative to their
younger counterparts. Older people tend to make less use of private vehicles and planes
which are major polluters and generate the most direct emissions. Habit formation matters as
well as the size of the household. Older households are typically smaller households (with
fewer members). Therefore, older households are generally expected to cause less
environmental pollution in the long run as they consume less energy overall. Taking a
different angle, the robustly negative association between population aging and
environmental degradation (especially in terms of energy consumption) might stem from
greater investment in renewable energy technologies. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) show
that countries undergoing faster aging have grown more in recent decades owing to a more
rapid adoption of automation technologies.
Empirical estimates also reveal that lHC reduces energy consumption (lenergy),
as demonstrated in Hondroyiannis et al. (2022). Related literature (Khan et al., 2020)
confirms the negative effect of human capital and eco-innovation on both non-renewable and
total energy consumption in G-7 countries. Interestingly, the effects of human capital (lHC)

become considerably larger in magnitude under the MG estimator (columns 1 and 3)
compared to results from the DCCE estimator (columns 5 and 7). However, there is a lack of
robust evidence on the link between human capital (lHC) and CO2 emissions (lco2em).
The negative impact of human capital on energy consumption portrays that education,
manifesting – among others – as greater environmental awareness, can play a vital role in
averting environmental degradation. Along these lines, climate-conscious consumers exert
pressure on regulators to take action to protect the environment (Herweg and Schmidt, 2022).
Oil prices (loil) have a negative and statistically significant effect on energy consumption
(lenergy), which likely reflects the fact that higher oil prices decrease the demand for energy
and reduce high-carbon energy consumption. Consistent with this interpretation, and in line
with the existing studies which document that higher energy prices promote clean energy
consumption (Yao et al., 2019), we find that oil prices (loil) are negatively associated with
energy consumption (lenergy) solely under the MG estimates (columns 1 and 3). In contrast,
the nexus between oil prices and CO2 emissions is negligible except for column 4 which
documents a robustly negative impact of high oil prices (loil) on carbon emissions (lco2em).
Empirical outcomes disclose that economic growth (lGDPreal) is positively associated
with energy consumption (lenergy) and CO2 emissions (lco2em), especially under the MG
estimator (columns 1–5). From the economic perspective, increasing income spurs the
demand for energy consumption and enhances carbon emissions due to lifestyle trends of the
wealthy such as high levels of car ownership, high domestic usage due to a large assortment
of appliances and high industry concentration in wealthier regions (Shahbaz et al., 2022; Yaziz
et al., 2022).
Economic openness (lopen) does not appear to have a statistically significant effect on the
dependent variables in our sample, although the point estimates are negative, suggesting that
higher openness would depress energy consumption (lenergy) and CO2 emissions (lco2em).
Overall, population aging – as reflected in higher elderly ratio (lelderly) and old-age
dependency ratio (loldage) – is an important channel for curbing energy consumption
(lenergy) in the OECD sample. Empirical estimates for lHC paint a similar picture. The other
control variables do not have a clear impact on the set of dependent variables. Economic
growth (lGDPreal) increases energy consumption (lenergy) and CO2 emissions (lco2em), but
this effect is not statistically significant across all specifications. At the same time, empirical
evidence for oil prices (loil) is rather mixed.
5. Conclusions
The OECD countries are facing unprecedented challenges related to climate change and
population aging. The urgent need to avert environmental degradation amid an aging
population has raised significant economic and environmental concerns in academic research
and policymaking. The notion of human capital, including – among others – elements of
environmental literacy, plays a central role for economic inference. Considering its
importance, many studies have been carried out on this topic. However, none of the
existing studies has focused on the nexus between population aging and environmental
degradation accounting for human capital in the presence of cross-country heterogeneity and
cross-sectional dependence, as is the case in our model.
To fill this gap, we make several important contributions to the extant literature. First, we
shed light on the joint impact of population aging on environmental degradation in the OECD
over the period 1980–2019 accounting for human capital, an issue relatively unexplored.
Second, apart from having a different focus, our study differs in terms of the empirical
methodology. Our approach offers significant advantages in terms of accounting for
cross-country heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependencies among the OECD sample
countries. Third, our paper differs in that we move beyond existing papers by controlling for

a rich set of alternative measures of the dependent and independent variables, a crucial issue
for ensuring the robustness of the outcomes.
One of the main findings of our paper is that population aging is robustly associated with
reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions under the MG panel estimator. Results
provide evidence that countries with a relatively higher share of elderly citizens are more inclined
to a lower level of energy consumption and tend to emit fewer emissions. However, this study
provides a mixed picture on the impact of population aging on carbon emissions under the most
recently developed Dynamic Common Correlated Effects (DCCE) estimator. Overall, the growing
number of elderly people in theOECDseems to act as amitigating factor for energy consumption.
Our research is of great significance for environmental policymakers by illuminating the
favorable energy consumption patterns that population aging brings to advanced economies.
Re-echoing the findings of several recent studies and moving beyond them to account for
recent demographic developments, results suggest that human capital enhancement is robustly
associated with reductions in energy consumption. This finding is consistent across estimation
methods. One of themain reasons for this is the fact that environmentally aware citizens tend to
embrace low-carbon consumption patterns and make use of environmentally friendly
technologies, which helps to meet the energy efficiency targets as part of the 2050
decarbonization objectives. Channeling government expenditures towards human capital
development (and nurturing environmental consciousness) can be used by policymakers as a
key tool in the long-term response to climate change related risks. Given cross-sectional
dependencies and cross-country heterogeneity, empirical results underline the importance of
cross-OECD policy spillovers and knowledge diffusions across the OECD countries. The new
“energy culture” calls for concerted policy action even in the presence of an aging era.
Importantly, the model allows us to draw inference with important societal implications in the
fields of attitudes’ formation and quality of life. In particular, an increase in renewable energy
use has several societal benefits such as mitigating climate change, improving health by
reducing pollution associatedwith carbon emissions, improving energy security (uninterrupted
availability of energy sources at an affordable price) and enhancing environmental quality.
The main limitation of this study concerns data availability. Future research, and subject
to greater data availability in the future, could dig deeper into understanding the dynamics of
this complex nexus by incorporating additional control variables. Similarly, we focus on
aggregate renewable energy consumption, and we do not explicitly model the sources of
renewable energy (wind, hydropower, solar power, solid biofuels and other). Additional
analysis of the breakdown of renewable energy sources would be insightful – subject to data
availability – especially for meeting the recently agreed new target of 42.5% for EU countries
by 2030. A deep transformation of the European energy system is needed for the EU to meet
its target. Finally, extending the model to include a range of non-OECD countries that are also
experiencing demographic transformations is a promising avenue for future research.
