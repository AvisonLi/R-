Elastically driven shape change, or springback, in a press-hardened U-channel part made
from a tailor-welded blank (TWB) was simulated using a fully coupled thermo-mechanicalemetallurgical
finite element (FE) method. The TWB consists of boron steel and
high-strength low-alloy steel, which have significantly different hardenabilities. A combined
impliciteexplicit three-step simulation consisting of air cooling, forming and die
quenching, and springback was used for computational efficiency. All the required material
models such as the modified phase-transformation kinetics and phasetransformation-
related stress-update scheme were implemented in the FE software
ABAQUS with the user-defined subroutines UMAT, VUMAT, and HETVAL. The developed
FE procedure, including the material models, satisfactorily predicted the experimentally
measured shape changes of the TWB part. Here we present an in-depth analysis of the
residual stress development during forming and die quenching using different material
modeling schemes. It should be noted that the stress evolution of the two materials with
high and low hardenabilities were significantly different depending on the phase
transformation kinetics during forming and quenching. Moreover, in order to enhance
the prediction capability of the press-hardening simulations, it was essential to include
the phase-transformation-related strains in the material model.

1. Introduction
Press hardening is a hot-forming process of steel sheets to manufacture crash-relevant parts for autobody structures.
Because of its enhanced hardenability, 22MnB5 boron steel has generally been used as a blank material for the presshardening
process (Karbasian and Tekkaya, 2010). The process begins with the austenization of a boron-steel sheet at
about 900 C. The hot austenized blank is then formed by special tools, in which cooling channels allow quenching of the
deformed sheet for about 30 s. A substantial amount of martensite can be obtained during this die quenching, mostly by heat

transfer between the hot part and the surrounding cooler tools. The strength in the final part reaches values as high as
1500 MPa. For this reason, boron steel is often referred to as press-hardenable steel (PHS). In addition to the high strength
induced by the martensitic phase transformation, the almost negligible shape distortion (or springback) is another major
advantage of the press-hardening process (Altan, 2006; Lee et al., 2009a, 2009b). The low flow-stress levels of the forming
process, attributed to the high forming temperature, and phase-transformation plasticity are known to contribute to this
minimal shape change after forming.
Recently, less press-hardenable steels compared to boron steel, such as high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels, have been
utilized to compensate for the lack of ductility in press-hardened parts made with boron steel. The strength of HSLA steels
after press hardening is about 600 MPa (Choi et al., 2012, 2013), but higher uniform elongations can be achieved. Hereafter,
the less hardenable steel applied to the press-hardening process is referred to as L-PHS (low hardenability-PHS), while
conventional boron steel, which exhibits higher hardenability, is referred to as H-PHS (high hardenability-PHS).
Non-uniform stress distribution over the entire part, resulting from imperfect cooling, has been reported as a source of
shape distortion even after press hardening. This shape change occurring after forming and die quenching can be a critical
issue in the press-hardening process as well (Wagoner et al., 2013). Moreover, the tailor-welded blank (TWB) approach, in
which a blank made of different gauges or PHS sheets, or a blank made of both different gauges and PHS sheets, is used to
optimize strength and ductility simultaneously. This requires more investigations regarding the mechanical behavior during
the press-hardening process because of a larger shape change on the L-PHS side of a TWB part (Choi et al., 2013). Recently,
Choi et al. (2013) conducted press-hardening experiments with a TWB sheet consisting of HSLA steel and boron steel as L-PHS
and H-PHS, respectively. The L-PHS side of this sheet exhibited larger shape change than that on the H-PHS side. This
experimental observation was counter-intuitive because the strength of the H-PHS part was higher during forming, which
contradicts the classical interpretation based on elasticeplasticity; i.e., the higher the strength, the larger the springback. This
finding was one of the motivations behind the current study.
In the present study, the development of a stress field during press hardeningwas simulated using a fully coupled thermomechanicalemetallurgical
finite-element (FE) analysis. A specially designed U-channel, which is an accurate representation
of usual autobody structural parts, was adopted in this study to simplify the problem. All the simulations were conducted
using the commercial software ABAQUS (Dassault Systemes), in which the developed material models and phasetransformation
kinetics were implemented through the user-defined material subroutines. The phase transformation kinetics
considered in this study is phenomenological, which can be readily implemented in the finite element simulations for
metal forming process, although there are significant studies on the phase transformation at microscale (Ma and Hartmaier,
in press; Ortwein et al., 2014; Auricchio et al., 2014; Kato and Sasaki, 2013; Levitas and Ozsoy, 2009). In the material modeling,
the plasticity part of mechanical behaviorwas described by the classical J2 plasticity theory, to which transformation-induced
plasticity (TRIP) was specially added. In other words, constitutive modeling was carried out based on macroscale phenomenological
elasticeplastic model, in which the inter-granular (type 2 in Knezevic et al. (2013)) and intra-granular (type 3)
stresses in microscale were ignored for practical aspect of simulation for realistic sheet metal forming process.
Using the finite-element model, we attempted to systematically explain the stress development and shape-change
mechanism in the press-hardened TWB part. In addition, detailed stress analysis of the blank materials is provided to
demonstrate the role of the material model on the prediction capability of the modeling procedure.
2. Thermo-mechanicalemetallurgical modeling
When subjected to a heat cycle consisting of heating to the austenizing temperature (A3) followed by cooling, steel
components experience either free dilatation or significant thermal stress development depending on whether there are
geometrical constraints. Fig. 1(a) illustrates a steel rod with a free end. When linear heating and cooling is applied to the rod,
ferrite-to-austenite transformation (a/g) occurs during the heating cycle and austenite-to-ferrite transformation (g/a)
occurs during cooling cycle. Because there is no constraint at the end of the rod, free thermal expansion and contraction can
be activated without thermal axial stress. In this figure, the S-shape of the strain profiles during the transformations is
attributed to the difference between the densities of body-centered cubic (bcc) a phase and the face-centered cubic (fcc) g
phase. Satoh (1972), however, considered a geometrically constrained condition, shown in Fig. 1(b), for the same thermal
cycle in order to understand the development of residual stress in welding processes. In this case, large compressive and
tensile stresses developed during heating and cooling, respectively, because the constraints at both ends did not allow the
development of an axial strain. An opposite sense of stress development is shown in Fig. 1(b) during the phase transformations.
The two schematic figures illustrate that it is necessary to consider the effect of phase transformations on the
stress and strain development when steel parts are under complicated thermal and geometrical boundary conditions.
2.1. Modeling of phase transformation
Steels subjected to press hardening are designed to undergo solid-to-solid phase transformations in order to obtain the
desired part strengths. Depending on the chemical composition, imposed cooling rate, prior austenite state, and so forth, the
phase transformations occur either diffusionally or non-diffusionally.
To numerically implement diffusional transformations, the JMAK type equation (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl,
1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) or the Kirkaldy type equation (Kirkaldy and Venugopalan, 1984) can be utilized. Based on
H.H. Bok et al. / International Journal of Plasticity 73 (2015) 142e170 143
the ZenereHillert type isothermal kinetics equation (Zener,1946; Hillert, 1957), Kirkaldy and Venugopalan (1984) established
a generalized semi-empirical-isothermal transformation model based on multiplicative form, in which the transformation
rates depend on chemical composition, austenite grain size (AGS), temperature, and transformed phase volume fractions
affecting sigmoidal growth behavior.
In the original Kirkaldy model, the AGS is mainly associated with the area of nucleation sites at grain boundaries to account
for the larger nucleation sites for smaller average AGS. The chemical composition term represented the retardation effect of
Fig. 1. Stress and strain responses in a steel rod subjected to (a) unconstrained heatingecooling (dilatometry test) and (b) constrained heatingecooling (Satoh
test) cycles.

diffusional transformations by e.g., C, Mn, Cr, Mo. The semi-empirical model was fitted to various isothermal transformation
diagrams (IT diagram) of low carbon steels, published in the U.S. Steel Atlas data (U.S. Steel, 1963). This original model,
however, underestimated hardenability of steels in continuous cooling (Li et al., 1998). Then it was further improved by Li
et al. (1998), and was employed as a basis for the transformation kinetics in the present study. The modification by Li
et al. was mostly done to the chemical composition and sigmoidal growth terms of the Kirkaldy model. The Li model was
directly calibrated with data prepared by various continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams to obtain kinetics parameters.
To represent the effect of grain size, temperature, chemical composition and current phase transformation state, the
following rate form of the kinetics equation is expressed as:

where the variables G, T, Comp, and f stand for the ASTM AGS number, temperature, composition, and phase volume fraction,
respectively. The subscript k represents a specific phase, i.e., k ¼ 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for ferrite, pearlite, bainite, martensite, and
austenite, respectively.
Bk(G) in Eq. (2) is the AGS term to consider the grain boundary area, acting as nucleation sites of transformations. For B1, B2
and B3, the forms are 20.41G, 20.32G and 20.29G, respectively.
In the under-cooling effect term, (Tk  T)Nk, Tk for k ¼ 1, 2 and 3 are Ae3, Ae1 and Bs temperatures of the steels, respectively.
The reference temperatures Ae3 and Bs were based on empirical equations (Lusk and Lee, 1999; Steven and Haynes, 1956). The
exponent Nk are 3 for k ¼ 1, 2 and 2 for k ¼ 3 (Kirkaldy and Venugopalan, 1984; Li et al., 1998). In the same equation, Qk
represents activation energies of diffusional transformation reactions which are given by 27,500 cal/mol for all diffusional
transformations. R is the gas constant of 1.987 cal/mol K.
In Eq. (3), aelement
k is weight factor to the effect of chemical composition on kth diffusional transformation by the corresponding
alloy element, while bk is a constant. Celement denotes chemical content of alloy element in mass percent. The exponents
in Eq. (4) are defined by ck ¼ n0

In previous studies conducted by the present authors (2013, 2014), the model was further modified because the original
model revised by Li et al. largely underestimated the hardenability of the H-PHS sample owing to the omission of the boron

effect. First, we defined AGS as a function of the austenite deformation, based on a dislocationedensity model, in order to take
strain-induced diffusional transformation into account. Second, the exponent coefficients n0
k and n00
k in the sigmoidal function
of Eq. (4), which were constants in the original model, were modified as functions of temperature, namely,
nkðTÞ ¼ nk0 þ nk1DTk þ nk2DT2k
, to capture the transformation kinetics of H-PHS more precisely. Another under-cooling DTk
was set to be equal to Ae3  T (for k ¼ 1, 2) or Bs  T (for k ¼ 3).
The unidentified kinetic constants of the modified model were obtained through numerical optimization using fminsearch
program, which was based on the NeldereMead Simplex search algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965), of MATLAB® software
(MathWorks) by comparing the resulting hardness according to linear cooling processes. The objective function to be

Furthermore, the non-diffusional martensitic transformation approach of Koistinen and Marburger (KeM) (1959), or
1  exp[0.011(Ms  T)], was also modified to represent an S-shaped transformation curve below the martensite start
temperature Ms (Bok et al., 2013, 2014). Thus, the proposed modified martensitic (k ¼ 4) transformation kinetics is represented

In the above equation, HI and HII are the Heaviside step functions, i.e., HI is equal to one only when Ms_I ⩾ T ⩾ Tc, and HII is
equal to one when HI is zero. The super-cooling terms DTI and DTII in Eq. (5) are (Ms I  T) and (Ms II  T), respectively. The
reference temperatures Ms_I, Ms_II, and Tc for the H-PHS material are 422, 355, and 353 C, respectively. Finally, b, xI, xII, and N
were set to 1.496  103, 6.65 102, 0.117, and 0.651, respectively.
In contrast to H-PHS, the original Li and KeMmodels were used for L-PHS, which behaves as standard low-carbon steel in
terms of kinetics. All required chemical-composition data and material parameters in the transformation models for both HPHS
and L-PHS are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The isothermal transformation model was converted into a
non-isothermal transformation model by applying Scheil’s additivity principle (Scheil,1935) to account for the delaying effect
of transformation when the steel sheet undergoes cooling. In this study, the effect of dynamic recrystallization (Takaki et al.,
2014) during hot-working is not considered due to the forming temperature of the current hot press forming process. A
detailed treatment of the non-isothermal kinetics is omitted here, but interested readers can refer to our previous work (Bok
et al., 2014).

the total strain (dε):

In the case of steels, the elastic strain and the thermal-transformation-related additional strain components are relatively
smaller as compared to the plastic strain. Han et al. (2003) proved that the validity of additive decomposition when the elastic
strain is small in the metal plasticity. Also, it was found that this additive decomposition approach provided similar results as
and the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor under a moderately large plastic strain range (Miehe
and Apel, 2004). Then, this additive strain decomposition strategy has reasonably been applied to commercial codes such as
LS-DYNA (Åkerstr€om et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2012), DEFORM3D (Choi et al., 2013), ABAQUS (Bok et al., 2014). In particular,
Choi et al. (2012) accurately predicted thickness distributions, formability, weld-line movement in a real hot press formed
automobile TWB part using the same additive decomposition employed in the current study.

In Eq. (8), the thermal strain is associated to the density change of existing phases according to temperature change. The
volumetric strain, however, occurs due to the difference in densities between fcc austenite and bcc phases. Therefore, the
former always exists under temperature gradient condition, while the latter is temporarily active only when transformation
proceeds.

transformation process. Nonlinear mixture rule can be an alternative assumption of yielding (Åkerstr€om et al., 2007). For
more detailed description for the yield stress calculation of mixed microstructure, more in-depth investigation might be
necessary.
Due to difficulties in measuring single phase flowstresses of ferritic phases as they tend to form a mixture of phases during
cooling, the flow stresses of the ferrite, pearlite, bainite, martensite were predicted by Choi et al. (2013) with the thermodynamics
database software, JMatPro® (Sente Software), which predicts the thermodynamic and mechanical properties of
various alloys (Saunders et al., 2003). JMatPro® provided the flow stresses of ferritic phases of H-PHS and L-PHS using a
thermophysical model based on the chemical composition of the steels (Choi et al., 2013). Applied strain rate was 0.1/s.
Temperatures were at 500, 600, 700 C for pearlite and bainite, 600, 700, 800, 900 C for ferrite and 100, 200, 300, 400 C for
martensite. Then, these flowcurves of ferritic phases (k ¼ 1, 2, 3, 4) were fitted to the Swift lawas a function of temperature in
Eq. (14).
However, the flow stress of austenite (k ¼ 5) was measured experimentally applying various temperature and strain rates
because the mechanical properties of the austenitic phase are the most important in the forming step (Yoo et al., 2010). To
consider strain rate sensitivity of austenite while forming, a modified form of the JohnsoneCook law was employed, namely,

The stress update in the user-material subroutine was conducted based on a predictorecorrector method (Simo and Ortiz,
1985; Lee et al., 2005; Voyiadjis et al., 2012; Shojaei and Li, 2013). First, a trial stress vector was elastically computed with the
given strain increment at a given time step n þ 1. It was then modified to consider the thermo-metallurgical contribution, i.e.,

In Eq. (17), the generalized Hooke’s lawwas used to calculate the stress increment. The variations of the elastic modulus as
a function of temperature with increasing time were ignored from the calculation of the trial stress, which does not affect the

2.3. Implementing material models via user-defined subroutines
The user-defined subroutines UMAT for the implicit code and VUMAT for the dynamic explicit code were considered for
the implementation of the material models and phase-transformation kinetics. Note that a consistent tangent modulus
should be coded for UMAT in order to obtain a quadratic convergence rate in the implicit code (Abaqus, 2006). Furthermore,
the user-defined subroutine for heat generation, HETVAL, was employed to account for the latent heat during phase transformation.
In HETVAL, the heat generation qtrs is defined as
qtrs ¼
X5
k¼1
DHk_fk; (23)
where latent heats DHk of 89.4, 77.5, 66.5, and 81.5 kJ/kg for k ¼ 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, were selected from the literature
(Lee et al., 2010). The other thermal properties such as the density r, specific heat cp, and conductivity l were also modeled as
functions of temperature or both temperature and phase fractions, namely,
rðTÞ ¼
X5
k¼1
fkrkðTÞ: (24)
In this case, the phase fractions calculated by either UMAT or VUMAT were regarded as field variables of USDFLD, another
user-defined subroutine for the definition of any field variable. The thermal properties in Eq. (24) were defined through the
input deck of ABAQUS, in which temperaturewas incorporated with the field variables. The thermal coefficients in Eq. (24) are
listed in Table 4. In this table, specific heat cp, and conductivity l were experimentally measured with H-PHS and L-PHS sheets
using the TC-700 calorimeter by ULVAC Technology Inc. (Choi et al., 2012) and fitted to be functions of temperature.

3. FE simulations
3.1. Validation of the developed model and implementation
The overall phase-transformation behavior and resulting strain changes can be captured through dilatometry tests, as
shown in Fig. 1(a).
As explained in the last part of Section 2.1, the original model that was improved by Li et al. was used to model the
diffusional transformation behavior of L-PHS. Meanwhile, the modified diffusional transformation was modeled for H-PHS.
To verify the feasibility of the developed material model, a series of dilatometry tests were simulated for L-PHS and H-PHS
and compared to the corresponding experimental results. For this attempt, the specimens were subjected to three different
linear cooling rates of 0.5, 10, and 50 C/s. As shown in Fig. 2, the calculated dilatations are, on the whole, in reasonable
agreement with the experiments for both steels. Compared to the simulated dilatations of H-PHS, those of L-PHS show less
accurate results because the Li model is supposed to follow an average behavior of nonisothermal kinetics behaviors of
various steels as explained in Section 2.1. One of the reasons for the deviation from the experiment is that a perfect optimization
of the kinetics parameters using the current kinetics equation is rather difficult to cover the highly nonlinear
dilatation behaviors under the entire cooling rate range. In particular, the clear and complete separation of ferrite and pearlite
transformations in the calculated transformation (leading to the non-monotonic behavior) results in the major deviation from
the continuous-wise transformation in the experiment. This continuous ferrite and pearlite transformation is likely due to a
common transformation range in which ferrite and pearlite transformations coexist in the end of ferrite transformation (or in
the beginning of pearlite transformation). Another reason is the selection of the objective function in the optimization. The
authors regarded the Vickers hardness should represent the resulting transformation behavior. Based on this assumption, an
objective function, comparing the calculated hardness to the corresponding experimental one, was established.
In the experiment and simulation, the phase transformations of L-PHS are densely located in the temperature range of
700e900 C, which led to ferrite dominant microstructures even at the highest cooling rate. This implies that the kinetics of LFig.

PHS has a less effect on the final expected mechanical property and residual stresses due to the similarity of microstructure
and transformation range regardless of the cooling rates.
Meanwhile, the range of transformation temperature for H-PHSwas much broader and lower because of the higher carbon
content and the addition of boron as a strong hardenability enhancer. Therefore, the final microstructures of boron steel were
more diverse: a mixture of ferrite, pearlite, bainite, and martensite depending on the cooling rate. The calculated phase
volume fractions of ferrite and martensite are shown in Fig. 3. Through these simulations, it can be concluded that the basic
transformation kinetics and corresponding strain responses were appropriately captured for the two different steels.
For the validation of the developed material models and their implementation, the simulated formability of more complex
TWB mini-pillar was compared to the experiment. The thickness distribution and weld-line movement were well matched
with measurements, which successfully validated the availability of the current modeling approach.
3.2. Shape change in press-hardening process for U-channel prepared with TWB of L-PHS and H-PHS
3.2.1. Modeling procedure
The shape change (or distortion) of the TWB made of L-PHS and H-PHS sheets, joined by CO2 laser welding, was simulated
by considering a full press-hardening process: transferring the blank to the tool, forming, die quenching, and springback. The
simulation for the blank transfer was simplified as air cooling for 10 s from the heating temperature of 930 C.
In this FE model, the fusion and heat-affected zones (HAZ) were not physically considered by the fact that the applied CO2
laser welding left a narrow weld line in the TWB. The width of weld affected zone was approximately 3 mm. In addition, an
annealing was automatically conducted during the austenitization for around 5 min. before press-hardening, which might
reduce the effect of the HAZ.
For efficient handling of computational cost and the convergence issue, a coupled impliciteexplicit FE approach was
employed. In other words, the air cooling and springback were solved by the implicit code with UMAT and HETVAL, while the
forming was solved by the explicit code with VUMAT.

H.H. Bok et al. / International Journal of Plasticity 73 (2015) 142e170 155
To describe the air cooling, a temperature-dependent film coefficient hair was applied against the ambient temperature
of 20 C: hair ¼ 11.8 þ 2.49  103T þ 1.14 104T2 W/m2K (Choi et al., 2013). On the other hand, for the forming
process, the contact-heat-transfer coefficient hc between the blank and tools was expressed as a function of the contact
distance lgap (Choi et al., 2012). The magnitude of hc was 1500W/m2K when lgap was within a critical distance lgap_c,
which was 0.067 mm in this study. When lgap was between lgap_c and the maximum distance lgap_max, hc was set to (0.1/
lgap) W/m2K. The Newton’s cooling law was employed to obtain these heat transfer coefficients with measured cooling
curves.
The FE model used in this study is depicted in Fig. 4. The width and thickness of the TWB were set to 275 mm and
1.5 mm, respectively. A plane-strain boundary condition was imposed on a 1.5-mm-long section along the longitudinal
direction of the U-channel. In this FE model, the heat-affected zone along the weld line was ignored for the sake of
simplicity. Six elements in the thickness direction were employed to appropriately model the die radii and bending by the
punch. The ABAQUS 3D continuum element C3D8T (with temperature degree of freedom) was chosen for the TWB sheet.
The simulation consisting of air cooling, forming, and die quenching was then implemented with the initial temperatures of
930 and 25 C for the TWB blank and tools, respectively. The temperature of the (rigid) die was kept constant to reduce
computation time.
In the air-cooling step, the simulation of natural cooling via heat loss to the ambient air through the free surfaces lasted for
10 s. The average computation time including air cooling, high temperature forming, die quenching and final air cooling was
approximately 8 h with the Intel Xeon CPU X5690 3.46 GHz. Most of the computation time was spent to calculate the shape
change during cooling and only a couple hourswas required for forming step. The temperature of the H-PHS side decreased to
740 C without any ferritic phase transformation. However, the temperature of the L-PHS sidewas 40 C higher because of the
latent heat during the ferritic transformation, as shown in Fig. 5.
The distributions of temperature, phase fraction, stress, and strain at the end of the air-cooling step were imported to
the forming step as a set of initial conditions. Fig. 6 shows this forming step, which consisted of a drawing mode followed
by a bending mode as the upper die moved down with a velocity VD of 25 mm/s; the full stroke was 50 mm in length. Until
the half die stroke, the blank was geometrically constrained by the binders leading to the drawing mode. Since the gap was

larger than the blank thickness, no blank holding force was generated. This loose blank holding was, in fact, introduced not
only to allow smooth drawing but also to prevent premature cooling by contact between the sheet flange and the tools. The
TWB was then relieved from the holding as the edges of the flange escaped from the short binders, thus removing the
constraint. Eventually, at the end of forming, the flange regions were freely bent as the die corners successively swept the
outer surfaces of the flanges. This forming procedure can be roughly divided into drawing and bending modes, as presented
in Fig. 6.
Consequently, the upper region of the part was subjected to a drawing-like process without the blank holding force as
long as the outer-flange regions were located inside the gap. However, the lower region of the part, including the lower
walls, underwent a tension-free bendingeunbending with the bending radius, which was initially much larger than the
die-corner radius owing to the unclamping. Finally, a simple bending in the die-corner regions of the part followed (see
Fig. 6).
The next process was 20 s of die quenching for rapid cooling of the formed part via contact heat transfer. Relatively
uniform cooling was obtained because most part surfaces were firmly in contact with the tool surfaces, even in the wall
regions owing to the slanted angles of the walls. Fig. 7 shows the resulting distributions of temperature and martensite
volume fractions at the end of the forming and die-quenching steps.
After completing the forming and die-quenching steps, the stress and other state variables of the die-quenching
stage were transferred as the initial values of the springback step. This step was simulated by removal of the

tools with the import option of ABAQUS, and the relief of the residual stresses led to the final equilibrium-displacement
field.
In this work, simulations with (FEM_TR) and without (FEM_No_TR) phase-transformation effects were performed and the
results are shown in Fig. 8.
3.2.2. Shape changes in press-hardening part
The main deformation modes during press hardening can be classified as follows. First, the part undergoes free dilation in
the manner depicted in Fig. 1(a) during air cooling. During the die-quenching step, the Satoh test mode is expected since the
tools acted as the fixture in Fig.1(b). Therefore, a large amount of thermal stress evolved in the part during this step. Then, the
magnitude and mode of springback (or shape distortion) depended on the stress relaxation from the final distribution of
residual stress at the end of die quenching.
The shape change in the wall and top regions of the part was not very noticeable for both cases, i.e., FEM with (FEM_TR)
and without (FEM_No_TR) phase transformation, as shown in Fig. 8(a).
Compared to shape changes in other regions, the shape changes in the flange regions were more significant, especially on
the L-PHS side. This is clearly presented in Fig. 8(b) and (c), which are magnified views of the flange regions in Fig. 8(a).
Interestingly, the distortion predicted without phase transformation was more noticeable than the case with full consideration
of the phase-transformation effect.
When compared to the experiment, the presented modeling approach with phase-transformation effect (FEM_TR) was
very successful in predicting the shape change after the press-hardening process. The enlarged figures (Fig. 8(b) and (c)) show
a major difference in the trends of shape changes and between the magnitudes of the changes in FEM_No_TR and FEM_TR in
the flange regions. In particular, a reverse springback, or the so-called springforward, took place predominately in the FEM_TR
simulation of the L-PHS side, as shown in Fig. 8(c). This reasonably predicted the experimental observation.

during forming and die quenching.
158 H.H. Bok et al. / International Journal of Plasticity 73 (2015) 142e170
The springforward phenomenon is theoretically explained in a previous article (Narayanaswamy, 1980) as a phenomenon
that takes place in the presence of a large tension stress in a bent sheet during the cold-forming process. Bottoming in a Vbending
process also leads to springforward (Ogawa et al., 2010). In warm forming, this phenomenon is also observed in a
shape-memory alloy after warm bending followed by constrained cooling (Duerig and Albrecht, 1983). In these cases, the
commonly required condition for springforward is the existence of a combination of part bending and tensile stress before the
stress-relaxation step. Presumably, a similar situation arose around the die-corner regions of the current U-channel during
the press-hardening process. This issue will be dealt with in more detail in the following sections.
3.2.3. Investigation of through-thickness stress distributions during forming and die quenching
The stress distributions in the regions of the die corners were investigated because they were likely to play an important
role in different shape changes depending on the material model. The cross sections of the upper, center, and lower regions of
the die corner area on the H-PHS side were defined as AAUPR, AACTR, and AALWR, as indicated in Fig. 9. Similarly, those on the LPHS
side were defined as BBUPR, BBCTR, and BBLWR. The through-thickness stress profiles of these particular areas were
inspected thoroughly.
Fig. 10 shows that the trends of the through-thickness profiles in the longitudinal stress component S11, defined in
ABAQUS, were similar for both steels after the forming step. In particular, a compressive stress of about 150 MPa developed in
the lower cross sections facing the die corners, AALWR and BBLWR (die side), because of the simple blank bending at the end of
the forming step.
However, the trends in stress profiles at the end of forming deviated from each other after the die-quenching step, as
shown in Fig. 11. The longitudinal stress component in H-PHS decreased (almost) linearly from the die-side surface to the
punch-side surface (Fig. 11(a)). In contrast, a V-shaped profile was observed in L-PHS (Fig. 11(b)). Fig. 12(a) and (b) clearly
show that the change in the longitudinal stress, denoted as DS11 (¼ S11_end of die quenching  S11_end of forming), during die
quenching developed with different patterns. Moreover, Figs. 11 and 12 also show that, after die quenching, the through-

die quenching.
H.H. Bok et al. / International Journal of Plasticity 73 (2015) 142e170 159
thickness stress profiles of the bent regions were very similar. This indicates that the final stress profile was mostly determined
by the stress change DS11 during die quenching.
3.2.4. Discussion on the role of thermal strain and phase transformation
In this section, the role of stress distribution on the shape of the U-channel part (especially in the flange region) is
examined. Fig. 13(a) and (b) show the distributions of the longitudinal stress S11 after forming and die quenching. The nonuniformity
of the stress field in thewall regions at the end of formingwas significantly mitigated after die quenching. This can
be explained as follows.
In the absence of constraints, the thermal strain during cooling would result in contraction of the sheet, but because
of the geometrical constraint between the flange and the punch, this free thermal contraction was suppressed.
This constraining effect led to the development of tensile stress, replacing the previous non-uniform stress field. The
temperature drop during die quenching was as high as ~700 C, which was large enough to cause even plastic
deformation.
The magnitude of the developed stress on the H-PHS side during die quenching was larger than that on the L-PHS side,
which was due to the larger strength induced by the martensite-dominant phase transformation.
The springback, the primarily elastically driven shape change of the part, was roughly proportional to the residual stress
before the tools were removed. Therefore, the difference between the springback values on the H-PHS and L-PHS sides was
related to the difference between the residual stress of the two materials. Although there are several reasons for the
difference in the residual-stress levels, this study focuses on the characteristics of phase transformation between the two
materials. To analyze the possible effect of the latter on the stress levels, the stress component S11 and the total transformed
volume fraction were extracted from the outermost nodes PA and PB facing the die on AACTR and BBCTR. A critical
aspect was observed and shown in Fig. 14: the phase transformation occurred during the die-quenching step on the H-PHS
side (Fig. 14(a)) but during the forming step on the L-PHS side (Fig. 14(b)). In addition, about 30% of the austenite was
transformed before the forming step on the L-PHS side. This transformation characteristic is important because significant
stress relaxation could have taken place owing to the transformation plasticity during the phase change. Moreover, the
volume expansion resulting from the transformation may have overridden the thermal contraction (see Fig. 1(b)).
Therefore, the compressive stress by volume expansion could have been temporarily predominant in the transforming
range when subjected to a geometrical constraint. In fact, Fig. 14(a) shows that the stress component S11 decreased to
Fig. 16. Stressestrain responses at different nodes: (a) PA with (b) its enlarged figure of die-quenching region; (c) PB with (d) its enlarged figure of die-quenching
region.

e120 MPa in the die-quenching step (at 14.5 s) because of the volume expansion resulting from the austenite-tomartensite
transformation on the H-PHS side. The thermal stress then rapidly increased again after the martensitic
transformation was completed. In contrast to the H-PHS side, such a large stress fluctuation was not observed on the L-PHS
side during die quenching, as shown in Fig. 14(b), because the amount of austenite to be transformed was limited by the
earlier transformation before die quenching.
Fig. 15 shows a comparison of the values of equivalent plastic strain over time in H-PHS and L-PHS sections. The plastic
strain accumulated mainly during forming. Interestingly, additional plastic strains of about 0.003 and 0.006, which resulted
from the thermal stress during die quenching, accumulated in the H-PHS and L-PHS sections, respectively. This implies that
the thermally induced stress could reach the yield stress during die quenching. In the H-PHS section, there was no accumulation
of plastic strain after the peak compression (Fig. 15(a)) because the thermal stress did not overcome the high
strength of the transformed martensite.
In order to determine the effectiveness of the geometrical constraint by the tools during die quenching, the evolution of
the stresswas plotted as a function of the strain in the particular material points of the H-PHS and L-PHS sections, as shown in
Fig. 16. The constraining effect strongly suppressed the development of strain during die quenching (indicated by the dotted
box in Fig. 16(a) and (c)). It should be noted that the development of a tensionecompressionetension stress pattern is
featured in the H-PHS portion in Fig. 16(b), but monotonic tension for the L-PHS portionwas predicted, as shown in Fig. 16(d).
The stress developments for the two sections of the TWB were confirmed by the cyclic and monotonic behavior of the stress
through the thickness at the die corner, as shown in Fig. 17.
3.2.5. Explanation of stress development in L-PHS and H-PHS during press hardening
In this section, a simple schematic explanation of stress development in L-PHS and H-PHS is provided to account for the
different deformation results during springback. In the case of L-PHS, we assumed that the common S-shaped stress profile
along the longitudinal direction after forming would sufficiently represent the bending dominant effect, which is
Fig. 17. Comparison of stress profile changes in (a) AACTR of H-PHS and (b) BBCTR of L-PHS during die quenching and after stress relaxation.

illustrated in Fig. 18(a). The stress profile consists of an elastic part near the neutral surface and a plastic part out of the
elastic region. The schematic of the elastic limit (or yield strength, sy) of the material point through the sheet thickness is
also depicted in the figure. The stress limit increased as the material point approached the sheet surface because of strain
hardening. Note that the L-PHS microstructure at this stage consisted of ferrite and austenite owing to the early transformation.
In the die-quenching step, thermal tensile stress began to develop because of the tool constraint and the stress
level reached the limit strength assumed in the previous step. A schematic of the stress profile after this step is shown in
Fig. 18(b). Therefore, the resultant bending moment at this stage was negligible because of the symmetric stress profile,
which did not produce the so-called springback. In this case, an elastic recovery took place uniformly throughout the cross
section of the sheet’s bent region during the final springback step, as shown in Fig. 18(c). As discussed in Section 3.2.2, this
uniform stress relaxation in the bent region might have been the main cause of the reverse springback (namely, springforward)
phenomenon.
The stress profiles in the H-PHS and L-PHS sections were similar during forming, although the microstructure was
still fully austenitic, as schematically presented in Fig. 19(a). During the die-quenching step, however, significant

compressive stress induced by the martensitic transformation developed, allowing the non-symmetric stress profile to
remain, as shown in Fig. 19(b). In this case, the longitudinal stress might have been lower than the yield stress (or it
might have remained elastic) because of the transformation hardening by the formation of very hard martensite. Upon
completion of the martensitic transformation, a large distribution of the thermal tensile stress was generated elastically,
which produced the slanted stress profile shown in Fig. 19(c). Unlike the symmetric stress profile in the L-PHS section,
this H-PHS stress profile resulted in a bending moment and was favorable to springback. The bending moment
was compensated by the relaxation of the superimposed thermal tensile stress developed in the last step shown
in Fig. 19(d). Moreover, the magnitude of the thermal tensile stress in H-PHS was much larger than that in L-PHS owing
to the martensite formation. Therefore, the springback could have been effectively compensated by the reversespringback
(or springforward), led by a sufficiently large tensile stress. The shape change was also negligible in the
H-PHS section.
Note that for simplicity, the explanation provided above ignores the effect of strain rate and the Bauschinger effect on the
yield stress.

3.2.6. Single-element analogy to explain the role of thermal and phase-transformation-induced stress
In order to simplify the previous U-channel forming example while keeping the deformation mechanism of a real presshardening
application, a single finite element was analyzed for the same deformation and phase-transformation characteristics.
A single, fully coupled, continuum thermo-mechanical element with dimensions of 10  10  10 mm3 was subjected
to a two-step cooling process with rates of 20 and 50 C/s from the same initial temperature of 930 C. A tensile strain of 20%
was applied within 2 s of the start of rapid cooling to provide the forming effect. No further displacement was allowed in the
tensile direction during the rest of the cooling step to impose the constraint effect (on the geometric feature of the previous Uchannel).
Fig. 20 presents the simulated stresses and transformed volume fractions of the two steels with respect to the cooling time.
For H-PHS, the tensile stress mainly developed before the martensitic phase transformation because of the thermal
contraction during cooling. Once the martensitic phase transformation became dominant (at around 15 s), the stress became
compressive because of the volume expansion. Again, the stress changed sign and turned into tension owing to further
thermal contraction by cooling. Therefore, the overall longitudinal stress during cooling of H-PHS was tensionecompressionetension.
This confirms the result of the U-channel example.
In contrast, only a limited amount of compression stress developed in L-PHS during the early slow-cooling range, after
which the stress evolved mainly monotonically in tension during the rest of the cooling step. There is a sudden drop of stress
in the early rapid cooling region in accordance with minor transformation. This sudden drop, however, has never resulted in
the compressive stress state due to the limited amount of available austenite to be transformed. Therefore, the “monotonic”
means that the stress state remains tensile, while the “cyclic” implies that both “compressive” and “tensile” happen during
cooling.
As shown in Fig. 21, the major transformation took place at about 8 and 20 s for L-PHS and H-PHS, respectively. Owing to
the simplicity of the one-element approach, further analysis could be efficiently performed without much computational
effort. This section discusses the roles of the thermal and transformation-related strains on the evolution of stress. For this

the simulations were conducted for L-PHS or H-PHS with (w/) consideration of the full material models developed in the
present work or without (w/o) any combination of the strain mechanisms TRP, VOL, and TH.
First, it was observed that the compressive stress was only predicted when the volumetric strain due to transformation
was included, i.e., for the simulations w/TH-VOL-TRP and w/o TRP for both steels. In particular, the magnitude of the
compressive stress was the largest when the transformation plasticity was ignored, which led to deformation without
relaxation by additional (phase-transformation) plasticity. It is then discovered that when the volumetric strain due to phase
transformation was ignored while the thermal and transformation plasticity strains (the case w/o VOL) remained, the stress
relaxation was still significant but it never entered the compression region. This stress relaxation was dominant in the minor
transformation range for L-PHS and in the major transformation range for H-PHS.
The extreme case, for which none of the thermal and phase-transformation-related strains were taken into consideration
(w/o TH-VOL-TRP), was also considered to check the enhanced capabilities of the complete model for press-hardening applications.
As expected, the predicted stress histories were very different from all the other cases. In particular, the fluctuations
disappeared because the stress evolutions were based purely on mechanical deformation.
In summary, the simplified simulation results show that the volume expansion owing to phase transformation played a
major role in the development of the compressive stress. Moreover, this compressive stress was superimposed by the tensile
thermal stress developed with the specific geometric constraint of the U-channel die. The level of this compressive stress
could be mitigated by the transformation-plasticity effect. The FE analysis, carried out on the single element with various
material models, demonstrates that the phase-transformation-related strains had a significant influence on the development
of the residual stress field in the part during press hardening. From various viewpoints, this suggests that conventional FE
simulations without proper consideration of phase transformation may not be appropriate for the analysis of the presshardening
process.
4. Conclusions
The deformation and shape change of a U-channel part with a tailor-welded-blank (TWB) by press hardening were
simulated using the finite-element (FE) method and considering the phase-transformation effects. The TWB sheet consisted

of press-hardening steels with low (L-PHS) and high (H-PHS) hardenabilities. The constitutive model that accounted for
thermo-mechanical deformation under phase transformation was implemented in the simulation using the commercial FE
software ABAQUS with the user-defined subroutines UMAT, VUMAT, and HETVAL.
To realistically simulate a press-hardening process with improved computational efficiency, the entire simulation was
divided into three steps: (1) transfer of the TWB sheet on the tool surface, during which the temperature dropped because
of air cooling, was simulated using the implicit FE software ABAQUS/Standard; (2) forming and subsequent die quenching
were simulated with the FE software ABAQUS/Explicit; (3) springback was predicted by relaxation of the residual-stress field
in the part using the implicit FE software ABAQUS/Standard. As a result, the springback behavior in the flange area was
successfully captured in L-PHS and H-PHS by this three-step-simulation scheme without excessive computational cost. In
particular, when the phase transformation and other thermally induced strains were included in the material model, the
magnitude and trend of the springback response in the flange regions of the two materials were in good agreement with the
experimental results. An explanation of the mechanism of stress development in the L-PHS and H-PHS sides of the TWB part
during the U-channel’s press-hardening process is provided to account for the different springback behavior in the TWB
part.
The main observations obtained through this combined experimentalesimulation-based analysis are as follows:
 A substantial amount of tensile stress developed during the die-quenching step because of the constrained thermal
contraction owing to the particular geometry of the U-channel tool. The non-uniform stress distribution that took place
during forming was replaced by more uniform tensile thermal stress after die quenching.
 A large compressive stress developed during die quenching, led by the volumetric strain as the austenite transformed into
martensite in the H-PHS section. With further cooling, thermal tensile stress appeared after completion of the transformation.
These unique thermally induced strains resulted in a tensionecompressionetension cycle in the H-PHS section.
This stress evolution pattern did not appear in the L-PHS sheet because early diffusional phase transformations occurred at
higher temperatures, providing no chance for phase transformation in the die quenching stage. In this case, a nearly
monotonic stress pattern was obtained.
 Before the springback step, the stress profiles of both H-PHS and L-PHS were all tensile through the entire cross section
around the die corners. However, the stress profile in L-PHS was (nearly) symmetric, while the stress profile in H-PHS
showed a non-symmetric slanted distribution.
 The residual stress distributions before the springback step differentiated the resultant bending moment after the die
quenching, which was compensated in the reverse-springback process by the superimposed thermal tension during the
final springback step.
 Consequently, a small amount of reverse springback, (i.e., springforward) was predicted in the L-PHS section but almost
negligible shape change was predicted in the H-PHS section by the coupled thermo-mechanical FE analysis. This result
might be explained by the tension-dominant stress relaxation in the L-PHS section, as well as a balance of springback and
springforward in the H-PHS section. The predicted shape changes were in good agreement with experimentally observed
shape changes for both materials.
 The roles of various strain components related to the thermal and metallurgical aspects were investigated in more detail
using a simpler approach with single-element FE analysis. It was found that the phase-transformation-associated strains,
including volumetric and phase-transformation plasticity strains, should be considered for an accurate prediction of the
stress field in a press-hardened part.

Appendix A. Flow chart for stress integration procedure
The stress update considering thermal and transformation related strain component, described in Eqs. (17)e(22), can be
schematically explained in Fig. A1.
Before a stress update procedure is initiated in UMAT, increments of phase fractions are firstly evaluated in the current
time step at Tnþ1 temperature to obtain thermal and transformation related strains, i.e., dε
th, dε
vol and dε
trp by Eqs. (8) and (9).
Then, these additional strain components are initially subtracted from the given total strain increment dε, provided by the
ABAQUS. In this case, the transformation-induced plasticity strain increment dε
trp is calculated with the stress component at
the end of previous time step for simplicity assuming that the size of time increment is very small by the nature of explicit FE
algorithm. Therefore, the magnitude of stress differences between the time steps tn and tnþ1 is also small.
With this condition, the trial stresses are obtained purely elastically. After checking the yield condition in Eq. (18), the
stresses at the current time step can be updated either elastically or plastically. In the plastic state, an appropriate correction
of the overshot stresses is carried out along the radial direction of the yield locus defined by von Mises isotropic plasticity. This
procedure, called radial return-mapping or predictorecorrector method, can be implemented semi-implicitly with the
166 H.H. Bok et al. / International Journal of Plasticity 73 (2015) 142e170
cutting-plane method consisting of several sub-increments in a course of stress correction to the updated yield surface Fj
nþ1
as shown in Fig. A1 (Simo and Ortiz, 1985).
In each sub-increment, the magnitude of plastic strain dε is increased by Ddε and the trial stress components are decreased
by dε  vF=vs as presented in the figure (3. Plastic corrector). This process proceeds repeatedly until the tolerance to the yield
condition is satisfied, namely, F⩽Tol.
The cutting-plane algorithm takes the yield surface normal evaluated at the end of previous iteration stage i to correct the
trial stress components to the yield surface at the current iteration step i þ 1 in the current time step tnþ1. This implies that the
direction of a plastic strain during iteration does not always guarantee the exact normal to the yield surface at i þ 1th iteration
step. Therefore a small amount of drift from the exact stress state can be involved when, especially, stress state is complicated.
Nevertheless, this method provides a quadratic convergence rate and also calculations of matrix inverses required for fully
implicit return-mapping algorithm is not necessary, which is useful for the ABAQUS explicit solver for forming and diequenching.
