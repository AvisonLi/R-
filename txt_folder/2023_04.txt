Fish from commercially farmed stocks are often released into the natural environment to supplement wild
populations. This practice is often applied to salmonid fish as they are an essential fishery resource and also used
for recreational angling. However, farmed fish tend to show lower survival rates after release than wild fish. For
this reason, the release of semi-wild fish is increasingly used in Japan; these fish are generated using female fish
from domesticated stocks and male fish of wild origin. The survival rate of released semi-wild fish is higher than
that of farmed fish, but the reason for this is unknown. This study compared the metabolism and swimming
performance of semi-wild and farmed masu salmon (Oncorynchus masou). The analyses showed that resting
metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and swimming speeds that minimize energy costs of
travel (optimal swimming speed) were higher in semi-wild fish than in farmed fish. Critical swimming speed did
not differ significantly between the two groups of fish. Semi-wild fish with high RMR may have a social status
advantage over farmed fish because a previous study reported that SMR, which is the value closest to basal
metabolism significantly affects feeding motivation. This means that individuals with higher social status may be
more motivated to feed. As RMR is proportional to food requirements, then release programs should be planned
taking food resources at the release site into consideration.
1. Introduction
Many fish species have been domesticated over multiple generations
and maintained in artificial hatcheries for use in species conservation or
fishery stock enhancement (Fraser, 2008; Lorenzen et al., 2012). Occasionally,
individuals from these hatcheries escape into the natural
environment; in addition, fish may be deliberately released into the wild
for stock enhancement or management (Hyman et al., 2016). Salmonids
are a prime example of large-scale artificial incubation and release
programs (Fraser, 2008). In Japan, masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou),
which has been subjected to multiple generations of artificial breeding
in hatcheries, has been actively released in many areas to enhance
populations in mountain streams (Morita et al., 2006). Despite an
aggressive policy of release, commercial catches have declined since the
1970s (Miyakoshi et al., 2008; Nagata et al., 2012). The increase in
recreational catches of juvenile fish may be one of the reasons for this
fall in commercial catches (Ando et al., 2002). However, in 2021, a trend
of increasing abundance was observed in some areas of Honshu and in
rivers in the east of Hokkaido, Hokkaido, Japan (Sahashi et al., 2018); by
2020, catches in the waters around Japan were at the second lowest
level after 2017, but are considered to be in the middle of the stock
fluctuations over the past 20 years (Hasegawa and Fukui, 2022). However,
for the sustainable use of masu salmon stocks, the, more effective
fish production and release techniques are required.
It has been reported that hatchery-reared and domesticated salmonids
used in release programs have lower survival rates than wild fish
due to a lower ability to adapt to the natural environment (Araki et al.,
2007, 2008; Berejikian and Ford, 2004; McLean et al., 2003). The low
adaptability of domesticated salmonids may have resulted from selection
for traits that are important for hatchery growth and survival but
not for the natural environment (Einum and Fleming, 2001; Solberg
et al., 2015). For example, hatchery-reared juvenile steelhead trout
show reduced predator avoidance compared to wild fish (Berejikian,
1995). Studies using meta-analyses have reported that captive salmonids
are more aggressive and less responsive to predators, resulting in
lower survival rates in the natural environment (Einum and Fleming,
2001). In addition, in masu salmon, the timing of smoltification
(Koyama et al., 2007) and predator avoidance ability (Yamamoto and
Reinhardt, 2003) differ between captive fish and wild individuals. The
behavioral and physiological differences between hatchery and wild fish

can result in the fish competing for habitat, food resources, and breeding
partners. As a consequence, the release of farmed fish may not increase
population sizes; instead, hatchery-derived fish may replace wild conspecifics
(Sahashi et al., 2015). Measures have been taken to reduce the
effects of domestication, such as the use of captive-bred stock that has
not experienced more than one generation in captivity, but this has not
solved the problem. The underlying cause of the competition between
hatchery-derived and wild individuals is unknown. To elucidate the
basis of this problem, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms
that affect juvenile fish survival during early life stages in the natural
environment is required.
In Japan, to correct the release effects caused by such differences in
the characteristics of wild and farmed fish, the creation of semi-wild fish
with wild fish as fathers and farmed fish as mothers has been proposed.
(Japan Fisheries Agency, 2018). Semi-wild fish are more difficult to feed
than hatchery-bred fish during the fry growth period and require more
time and effort to produce. Because farmed fish have a high fecundity
combined with wild fish characteristics, it is thought that a balance can
be achieved in the field after release. The basis of this approach is that
the high reproductive rate of domesticated fish can be complemented by
the adaptability to the natural environment of wild fish. Semi-wild fish
have been reported to have intermediate physiological responses to
environmental stresses compared to hatchery and wild fish (Solberg
et al., 2013). In a study on egg-to-smolt survival in a natural environment
in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), semi-wild fish were reported to
have a lower survival rate than wild fish but a higher survival rate than
farmed fish (Skaala et al., 2012). In white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis),
the survival rate of released semi-wild fish was 2.5 times
higher than that of farmed fish (Yamashita et al., 2020). In turbid water
environments, semi-wild fish have been reported to have a 3.2-fold
higher upstream migration performance than farmed fish (Yamashita
and Suzuki, 2019). An increase in the proportion of genes derived from
wild fish in masu salmon and chum salmon (O. keta) was shown to increase
the wild survival of captive-bred fish (Sahashi and Morita, 2022).
However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding why
semi-wild fish show higher survival rates than farmed fish.
Juvenile salmonid form dominance hierarchies within the rivers they
inhabit (Yamamoto et al., 1998). Ranking in the hierarchy is closely
related to foraging behavior, habitat use, growth, and migration
(Nakano, 1995). Dominant individuals exclusively use the middle and
surface layers of pools as foraging habitats. They have preferential access
to drifting food, resulting in more significant growth and higher
sedentariness than more subordinate individuals (Nakano, 1995). A
study of social status in a hierarchy and physiological responses in juvenile
Atlantic salmon showed a strong correlation between standard
metabolic rate (SMR) and rank in the hierarchy, with higher SMR
indicating higher rank (Metcalfe et al., 1995). This correlation was
influenced by the density of individuals in the habitat, with lower
densities resulting in less aggression and competition, higher mean food
intake and growth rates, and no relationship between SMR and growth
rates (Reid et al., 2011). In other words, at high densities where the
availability of suitable feeding habitat is limited, individuals with high
SMR will have lower growth due to the cost of maintaining their ranking
at the top of the hierarchy. On the other hand, individuals with low SMR
will not secure enough food and will be disadvantaged in the competition
for survival. Thus, the metabolic rate of an individual is an essential
factor that determines its competitiveness for food resources.
Metabolic rate is an essential physiological indicator that determines
survival in the field because behavior such as feeding, escape from
predators and competitors, digestion, growth, and reproduction all
require oxygen (Eliason and Farrell, 2016). Furthermore, the relationship
between current velocity and feeding success is important in drift
feeder habitat selection and hierarchy formation (Bozeman and Grossman,
2019). In other words, the ability to swim to localization is an
important indicator in assessing competitive ability of fish in rivers.
Therefore, we hypothesized that when fish density in a habitat is
increased by release, the higher metabolism of semi-wild fish than that
of released farmed fish will result in a higher ranking in the hierarchy for
semi-wild fish, and as a result, semi-wild fish will be more likely to
become established in their natural environment than farmed fish. According
to our hypothesis, semi-wild fish are more likely to become
established in the natural environment than farmed fish. A semi-wild
fish and a farmed fish were created in this study, both of which have
the same mother and father as wild or farmed fish. We compared the
metabolism and swimming ability of the two groups of fry by means of
swimming respirometry.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Capture of parent fish, artificial insemination, and incubation of
fertilized eggs
All of the researchers who participated in this study have taken an
ethics course on animal experiments at the College of Bioresource Sciences,
Nihon University. All experiments were conducted following the
ethical regulations for animal experiments of the College of Bioresource
Sciences, Nihon University. In this study, the experiment was conducted
on masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) to measure the metabolism and
swimming performance. The experiments were conducted from
November 2018 and November 2019 at Akita Prefectural Institute of
Fisheries. Both wild and farmed fish were used as male parents. The wild
fish were collected in October 2018 and October 2019 using a cast net
and an electrofisher in the Juninosawa Stream, a tributary of the Ani
River, Akita Prefecture (Fig. S1). No artificially hatched individuals have
so far been released into the Juninosawa Stream; thus, the 10 captured
males each year were assumed to be wild fish. Wild fish of resident forms
were used as experimental fish. Fish raised in inland water test ponds at
the Akita Prefectural Institute of Fisheries were used as the farmed fish.
The farmed fish used in the experiment were gametes collected from
masu salmon caught in the Ani River, artificially inseminated, and
reared in inland water test ponds of the Akita Prefectural Institute of
Fisheries. Seven generations of farmed fish were used as parents for the
farmed fish of male and female in 2018. Eight generations of male
farmed fish and four generations of female farmed fish were used as
farmed parents in 2019. Mean total body length and body mass of fish
used as parents were shown in Fig. S2.
The sampled individuals of both sexes were immobilized in FA100
(DS Pharma Animal Health Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), liquid with eugenol
adjusted at 10% to 100 ml of ethanol diluted to 0.5 ml/l in river water,
and then placed on a scale. The left side of the fish was photographed
using a digital camera (Nikon 1 AW1, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). The weight scale was surrounded by a light-shielding sheet in a
1 m cube so that the images of the experimental fish were not affected by
ambient light. After capturing the images, the weights and body sizes of
the experimental fish were measured from the digital images using
ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012).
For animal welfare reasons, both sexes of adult fish were over
anesthetized and euthanized before gametes were extracted. After
photography, the abdomen of each male was dried with a towel and
semen was gently extruded and stored in Whirl-Pak Sample Bags, taking
care to avoid contamination with water, urine, or feces. The sperm
samples were stored in a cooler box maintained at 4 ◦C until used for
fertilization. The abdomen of each female was opened with dissecting
scissors, the eggs were transferred to a bowl, and approximately
150–200 eggs were quickly placed into the ends of two Ziploc containers
(80 mm long x 156 mm wide x 53 mm high) using a mesh strainer.
Semen from wild and farmed fish were used separately for fertilization.
Approximately 100 μl of semen was dropped into the opposite end of the
Ziploc container using a micropipette; 100 ml of spring water was slowly
poured into the container to enable fertilization of the eggs. Fertilized
eggs were allowed to stand for 1 h and then placed in an incubation tank
containing 10 × 10 × 10 cm mesh baskets. Ninety days after hatching,

fish from both groups were transferred to circular tanks (140 cm
diameter and 70 cm height) to reduce density. After yolk absorption, the
fish were provided with formula feed three to five times a day according
to their body size for 371 days in the experiment commenced in 2018
and 291 days in the 2019 experiment. The juveniles of both groups were
separately kept in common environmental conditions to ensure that any
behavioral differences observed during the experiment were due to genetic
rather than environmental differences.
2.2. Metabolism and swimming ability measurement
The juvenile fish generated in November 2018 were subjected to
metabolic and swimming ability measurements in October 2019 at the
Akita Prefectural Institute of Fisheries (hereafter referred to as the 2019
experiment). The juvenile fish generated in November 2019 were moved
to the College of Bioresource Sciences, Nihon University, Fujisawa,
Kanagawa, Japan in August 2020 where they were acclimated in a 9 ◦C
tank for one week (hereafter referred to as the 2020 experiment). A
swim tunnel respirometer (model: 1500 ml, Loligo Systems, Viborg,
Denmark) was used to measure the swimming ability and oxygen consumption
of each individual. The area in which the fish could swim was
55 mm in diameter × 200 mm in length. At the Akita Prefectural
Institute of Fisheries, spring water at about 10 ◦C was circulated through
the respirometer; at the College of Bioresource Sciences, the water was
circulated through a plastic box maintained at 9 ◦C using a cooler to
minimize fluctuations in water temperature during the experiment. In
the swim-tunnel respirometer, the flow velocity was controlled using a
propeller located downstream. Calibration of the velocity was performed
before the fish were in place. Sensors for measuring dissolved
oxygen were installed upstream. Dissolved oxygen was measured at 1 Hz
using a Witrox 1 oxygen meter (Loligo Systems, Viborg, Denmark). To
minimize visual stimulation of the swimming fish, the experimental tank
was covered with black plastic sheets. A small window was created next
to the swimming area to check the swimming conditions during the
experiment. The water was changed for each individual to prevent the
accumulation of nitrogen waste. Changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations
were recorded multiple times in the absence of the fish and the
variation was found to be negligible. The water temperature during the
experiment was adjusted to maintain it within ±1.5 ◦C of the temperature
at the start of the experiment. The metabolic experiments were
conducted from October 3 to November 2 in 2019, from August 2 to
October 14 in 2020. During the experimental period described above,
we started the experiment at 7:00–9:00 a.m. and recorded data from a
maximum of three individuals per day. There were also days when the
experiment could not be conducted during the period. As the fish are
growing during this period, the effects of growth were minimized by
ensuring the order in which the experiments were conducted was not
biased in favor of one group; the experiments were conducted using
individuals from each group in turn. The fish used in the experiment
were fasted for 24 h to minimize the effects of energy consumption
associated with food digestion.
2.3. Experimental protocol
Before starting the experiment, total body lengths (TLs) of the
experimental fish were measured as described in Section 2.1. Experimental
fish were gently placed into the swimming section of the cylinder
to avoid stress. At the beginning of the experiment, the speed of the
water current in the respirometer is set as double the body length of the
fish to remove air bubbles in the swimming area. Acclimation was carried
out for 1 h at a flow rate of 0.5 TL/s. During acclimation, the flow
rate in the swimming area was kept constant and the water was circulated
using a pump to prevent the dissolved oxygen level from significant
decreasing (Fig. S3). If the dissolved oxygen level did not decrease
stably during RMR measurement, we either started from the beginning
or replaced the experimental fish with new ones. Therefore, it took up to
5 h to measure the metabolism of one individual. After acclimation, the
water hole, which connects the swimming area to the circulating water
reservoir, was plugged and the dissolved oxygen concentration was
recorded over a 0.5–1 h period. A flow rate of 0.5 TL/s was maintained
in the respirometer and the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded
after confirming that it was decreasing linearly. Based on the
recorded dissolved oxygen, oxygen consumption (referred to as MO2: mg
O2/h) was calculated from the following equation:
MO2 = [O2]v
where [O2] is the rate of decrease in that concentration in mgO2 L􀀀 1 h􀀀 1,
v is the volume of the swimming area (1.5 L). The rate of decrease in that
concentration was determined by using the slope value approximated by
a linear function from the start time to the end time of the measurement
section. The metabolic rate during this period was defined as the resting
metabolic rate (RMR). The reason is that during this period, the fish
swam slowly and moved their fins lightly to maintain their posture in the
dissolved oxygen meter. On the other hand, SMR is defined as the closest
approximation to basal metabolism when organs are completely still
(Chabot et al., 2016). Therefore, in this study, the metabolic rate
measured during this period was considered RMR. At the flow rate of 0.5
TL/s, the fish rarely swam. After measurement of RMR, the plug was
removed from the water passage hole in the swimming area and the
water was allowed to flow for about 0.5 h to bring the dissolved oxygen
concentration to saturation. At the end of this period when the dissolved
oxygen concentration had returned to the level before the start of the
experiment, the swimming area was again sealed with a plug. Initially,
the flow rate was set to 1.5 TL/s and the experimental fish was able to
swim in this current. The flow rate was then increased by 0.5 TL/s every
10 min; the increase in flow rate induced the fish to swim. When the
experimental fish became tired and began to stay downstream, the fish
were stimulated by exposing them to LED lights. If the fish still could not
swim, the speed at that point was defined as the final speed at which the
fish could no longer swim. The swimming test was terminated when the
fish could not escape from the downstream area for more than 5 s after
doing this. The maximum metabolic rate (MMR) calculated as the oxygen
consumption per unit time during the highest flow rate.; Ucrit is
defined as the highest swimming speed that a fish can maintain during a
defined time interval (Brett, 1964, 1967; Peake et al., 1997). Ucrit is
generally measured as cm/s or TL/s and is calculated as follows (Brett,
1965):
Ucrit = Up+Ui
Tp
Ti
where Up is the velocity at which the fish last swam for the full period, Ui
is the increase in speed (0.5TL/s), Tp is the duration in minutes that the
fish was able to swim against the water velocity that produced fatigue,
and Ti is the time interval at which the speed was increased (10 min). As
the fish were small relative to the cross-sectional area of the swim tunnels,
the Ucrit values were not corrected to account for the solid blocking
effect of the individuals (Bell and Terhune, 1970).
At the end of the experiment, the fish were immobilized using a
0.05% of 2-phenoxyethanol; the weights of the fish were measured to
the nearest 0.1 g as described in Section 2.1.
The relationship between MO2 and swimming speed (U) at each
speed was described using the exponential function:
MO2 = aebU
where a is the metabolic rate at rest or RMR, U is the swimming speed,
and b is a constant (Behrens et al., 2006). The cost of transport (COT) is
expressed in terms of distance traveled per hour (km) as a function of U
using the exponential function:
COT(U) = aebU􀀀 1
Y. Makiguchi et al.
Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part A 275 (2023) 111328
4
COT(U) was calculated and the value at which it became zero was set
as the optimum swimming speed (Uopt) at which the transportation cost
becomes minimum (COTmin; Behrens et al., 2006). Differentiating the
expression of COT(U) once and setting Uopt to the value of U when the
slope of the tangent line becomes zero, we obtain the following
equation.
Uopt = 1/b
COTmin was obtained by inserting Uopt into COT(U).
Water temperature during the swimming experiment was 10.69 ±
0.49 ◦C for semi-wild fish and 11.09 ± 0.78 ◦C for farmed fish in the
2019 experiment, and 8.98 ± 1.20 ◦C for semi-wild fish and 8.79 ±
0.32 ◦C for farmed fish in the 2020 experiment; the differences in temperature
were not significant (t = 1.152, p = 0. 272 for 2019 experiment;
t = 􀀀 0.384, p = 0.704 for 2020 experiment).
2.4. Statistical analysis
Body mass and total body length of fish at the time of experiment
were compared between the semi-wild and farmed fish in the 2019 and
2020 experiments using t-tests. RMR, MMR, Ucrit, Uopt, and COTmin
were used as a single data set for 2019 and 2020 without distinction, and
were compared between semi-wild and farmed fish using linear models.
RMR and MMR were compared between semi-wild and farmed fish using
a linear model with body mass as a covariate. To clarify the comparison
between semi-wild and farmed fish, which was the objective of this
study, a null model was set up with each parameter as response variable
and only year parameter as explanatory variable, and for RMR and
MMR, this null For RMR and MMR, a null model was set up with body
weight as a covariate and type of fish as an explanatory variable, and for
Ucrit, Uopt, and COTmin a model was set up with type of fish as an
explanatory variable. These models were compared by null model and
ANOVA to determine the impact of the added explanatory variables. R
software ver. 3.62 (Team, R Core, 2017) was used for the analysis. A
significance level of 5% was defined as statistically significant.
3. Results
Oxygen consumption increased with increasing speed in the two
groups (Fig. 1(a) for 2019, Fig. 1(b) for 2020). Body weight and caudal
fork lengths did not differ significantly between the two groups of fish in
either experiment (t = 􀀀 0.69, p = 0.51 for body mass in 2019, t = 􀀀 0.28,
p = 0.78 for body mass in 2020, t = 0.02, p = 0.98 for fork length in
2019, t = 0.04, p = 0.97 for fork length in 2020; Table 1). RMR and MMR
were larger in semi-wild than farmed fish (Table 2). Uopt was also larger
in semi-wild fish than farmed fish (Table 2). No differences were found
between semi-wild and farmed fish for Ucrit in TL, Ucrit in cm, and
COTmin (Table 2).
4. Discussion
This study compared the metabolism of semi-wild and farmed fish in
the Ani River, Akita Prefecture, Japan. The physiological differences
between the two types of fish were discussed in terms of their potential
impact on the survival of juvenile salmon after release for the conservation
of masu salmon resources. The swimming and metabolic performances
of semi-wild fish (produced using sperm derived from wild
fish) and of farmed fish (produced using males reared for 6 or 7 generations
in the hatchery) were compared using swimming respirometry as
a possible factor to explain the difference of the survival rate between
farmed and semi-wild fish. The results showed that RMR, MMR, the
upper limit of the maximum metabolic rate and Uopt were smaller in
farmed fish than in semi-wild fish. There was no difference in swimming
ability indexes such as Ucrit and body size between the two groups. RMR
differed between the semi-wild and farmed fish even though the
experimental fish were reared in the same environment, suggesting that
paternal origin had a significant genetic influence. SMR, which was
smaller in farmed fish than in semi-wild fish, has been reported to be an
essential indicator of hierarchical ranking in river life in juvenile
Atlantic salmon (Metcalfe et al., 1995; Reid et al., 2011) and masu
salmon (Yamamoto et al., 1998). Specifically, the higher the SMR, the
higher the position in the hierarchy. As a result, fish at the top of the
hierarchy can acquire better feeding grounds. Socially dominant
salmonid fry grow faster than their subdominant conspecifics (Metcalfe
et al., 1992), and the resulting body size advantage can reinforce social

hierarchies. Previous studies have reported that hatchery salmonid fish
have lower survival rates during the juvenile stage than wild and semiwild
fish (Skaala et al., 2012; Yamashita et al., 2020). In this study, RMR
was measured as an alternative to SMR, but the finding of lower RMR in
farmed fish compared to semi-wild fish in this study may suggest a
mechanism for the reported lower survival rates of farmed fish
compared to that of semi-wild fish. In this scenario, farmed fish with a
relatively low RMR may have a lower social status in river life than semiwild
fish and thus have a lower chance of obtaining suitable feeding
grounds, resulting in lower survival rates for farmed fish compared to
semi-wild fish.
Furthermore, MMR was also higher in semi-wild fish compared to
farmed fish. However, no difference was found in Ucri, which is indicators
of active physiology, swimming performance, and have been
reported to be related with athletic performance and swimming performance
(Plaut, 2001). In other words, the swimming performance of
semi-wild and farmed fish at the sizes examined in this study were
almost identical. Therefore, there may be competition between semiwild
and farmed fish in some areas, such as feeding and escape based
on high swimming performance in the natural environment. In foodconstrained
circumstances such as the natural environment, individuals
with high RMR and MMR may have an advantage in feeding.
Because individuals with high SMR consume food faster (Millidine et al.,
2009), SMR size significantly affects feeding performance in environments
where competition for food occurs. However, SMR becomes less
critical in food-rich environments (Auer et al., 2015). It should be noted
that these results are only indirect evidence of the competitive relationship
between semi-wild and farmed fish, as this study did not
examine semi-wild and farmed fish in an actual river. In future experiments,
it will be necessary to determine the comparative social status of
the semi-wild and farmed fish in the natural environment and how this
impacts their interactions.
Uopt, the swimming speed based on aerobic exercise, which is the
most energy-efficient unit transportation cost, was greater in semi-wild
fish than in farmed fish. On the other hand, there was no difference
between the two groups in Ucrit, the critical point from aerobic to
anaerobic exercise; Ucrit is faster than Uopt and is not suitable for
prolonged swimming. A study comparing the Ucrit of wild and farmed
fish reported no difference between the two (Dunmall and Schreer,
2003), implying that semi-wild fish with fast Uopt can cruise at a
somewhat higher speed than farmed fish in riverine living conditions
and currents. Considering these results, semi-wild fish may have an
advantage over farmed fish in food requirements and territorial disputes.
However, there is competition between semi-wild and farmed fish
in natural environments with various velocity zones. The habitat preferences
of juvenile salmonids vary among seasons (Nagayama and
Nakamura, 2007), with juvenile salmonids preferring deep water and
relatively high-velocity areas during the late summer and fall seasons.
Juvenile salmonids are primarily sedentary foragers receiving a
continuous supply of drifting invertebrates such as euphausiid larvae
(Keeley and Grant, 1997). Therefore, individuals that can hold their
position in fast currents are more efficient at foraging for drifting invertebrates
and have an advantage for survival (Nakano, 1995). The
efficiency of foraging by juvenile fish increases when the current is faster
and the water is deeper (H¨ojesj¨o et al., 2016). Converting Uopt to cm/s
units (Nielsen, 1992), Uopt was 36.4 cm/s for semi-wild fish and 28.0
cm/s for farmed fish in 2019, and 29.2 cm/s for semi-wild fish and 21.2
cm/s for farmed fish in 2020. Although differences in Uopt due to body
size effects must be taken into account, Sato et al. (2016) reported that in
the Juninosawa Stream, where the wild masu salmon used in this study
were captured, the fish showed reproductive behavior in conditions with
an average flow velocity of 33.3 cm/s. Although the spawning grounds
and fry habitat did not exactly coincide, the Uopt of the semi-wild fish
was closer to the average velocity of the river than that of the farmed
fish. This suggests that semi-wild fish are more likely than farmed fish to
maintain position in a fast-flowing current in order to sustain efficient
foraging.
In this study, COTmin, the oxygen consumption per unit time and
distance in Uopt, did not differ between hatchery and semi-wild fish.
This result implies that the swimming cost of farmed fish is inefficiently
high when they swim at the same speed as the semi-wild fish, suggesting
that they may be less competitive in food acquisition. Thus, semi-wild
fish can maintain their positions in faster currents than farmed fish,
giving them an advantage in food acquisition. This ability may explain
why semi-wild fish have a higher survival rate in natural rivers than
farmed fish.
The fish were older at the time of testing in 2019 than in 2020, but
there was no difference in average age, weight or length between semiwild
and farmed fish in either experiment. There was no difference in
weight and length between semi-wild and farmed fish in each experiment.
Growth and survival rates of juveniles have been reported to be
unaffected by the availability of food under the semi-natural conditions
in which the experiments were conducted (Robertsen et al., 2019). Semiwild
fish also consume more food than farmed fish of the same species
(Hatanp¨a¨a et al., 2020). The fry used in the present study were produced
by fertilization of eggs on the same day and reared under the same
environmental conditions with adequate feeding; the absence of any
difference in growth between the semi-wild and farmed fish is consistent
with previous studies. Hatcheries are selected to be rich in food resources
and to have high juvenile fish growth rates (Gross, 1998).
However, it is unclear how fry growth varies between the two groups in
natural environments where sufficient food is not always available.
Under such conditions, fish have been reported to prioritize growth
promotion over increases in metabolic rates (Bochdansky et al., 2005).
There is a trade-off between metabolic rate and growth; because food is
more restricted in natural than farmed environments, semi-wild fish
with higher SMRs than farmed fish have higher food requirements,
which may lead to insufficient resources and reduced growth under
overcrowded conditions after release (Biro and Stamps, 2008; Ridgway,
2008). When semi-wild and farmed fish are released into the natural
environment, the number of fish to be released must be determined
based on the environmental carrying capacity, i.e., by considering the
potential amount of food available to the fish. Otherwise, the growth of
the semi-wild fish may be reduced due to competition for food. Although
released semi-wild fish have a lower survival rate in the juvenile stage
than wild fish, they grow so quickly that they can displace wild juveniles

from their natural habitat (McGinnity et al., 2003). This kind of
competition may also occur between semi-wild and farmed fish.
Although the survival rate of semi-wild fish is 2.5 times higher than that
of farmed fish in the natural environment (Yamashita et al., 2020), semiwild
fish have a lower survival rate than wild fish (Skaala et al., 2012). It
is therefore better to release semi-wild fish than fully farmed fish, but the
effectiveness of the release may be reduced due to competition with
native wild fish.
The results of this study clearly show a difference in RMR between
semi-wild and farmed fish. When releasing semi-wild or farmed fish, it is
necessary to carefully examine the food resources in the habitat and to
determine in advance the appropriate number of fish to be released to
avoid generating food shortages. In addition, from the perspective of
maintaining resources in rivers, the results of this study also indicate
that it is better to use sperm from wild fish when generating fish for
release. Most fish released in mountain stream fisheries in Japan,
including masu salmon, have been derived from hatchery reared fish
because of the relative ease of their production under artificial,
controlled environments. Based on the results of this study, it is clearly
more desirable to produce and release semi-wild fish in light of their
competitive behavior with farmed and wild fish in rivers.

Fish from commercially farmed stocks are often released into the natural environment to supplement wild
populations. This practice is often applied to salmonid fish as they are an essential fishery resource and also used
for recreational angling. However, farmed fish tend to show lower survival rates after release than wild fish. For
this reason, the release of semi-wild fish is increasingly used in Japan; these fish are generated using female fish
from domesticated stocks and male fish of wild origin. The survival rate of released semi-wild fish is higher than
that of farmed fish, but the reason for this is unknown. This study compared the metabolism and swimming
performance of semi-wild and farmed masu salmon (Oncorynchus masou). The analyses showed that resting
metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and swimming speeds that minimize energy costs of
travel (optimal swimming speed) were higher in semi-wild fish than in farmed fish. Critical swimming speed did
not differ significantly between the two groups of fish. Semi-wild fish with high RMR may have a social status
advantage over farmed fish because a previous study reported that SMR, which is the value closest to basal
metabolism significantly affects feeding motivation. This means that individuals with higher social status may be
more motivated to feed. As RMR is proportional to food requirements, then release programs should be planned
taking food resources at the release site into consideration.
1. Introduction
Many fish species have been domesticated over multiple generations
and maintained in artificial hatcheries for use in species conservation or
fishery stock enhancement (Fraser, 2008; Lorenzen et al., 2012). Occasionally,
individuals from these hatcheries escape into the natural
environment; in addition, fish may be deliberately released into the wild
for stock enhancement or management (Hyman et al., 2016). Salmonids
are a prime example of large-scale artificial incubation and release
programs (Fraser, 2008). In Japan, masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou),
which has been subjected to multiple generations of artificial breeding
in hatcheries, has been actively released in many areas to enhance
populations in mountain streams (Morita et al., 2006). Despite an
aggressive policy of release, commercial catches have declined since the
1970s (Miyakoshi et al., 2008; Nagata et al., 2012). The increase in
recreational catches of juvenile fish may be one of the reasons for this
fall in commercial catches (Ando et al., 2002). However, in 2021, a trend
of increasing abundance was observed in some areas of Honshu and in
rivers in the east of Hokkaido, Hokkaido, Japan (Sahashi et al., 2018); by
2020, catches in the waters around Japan were at the second lowest
level after 2017, but are considered to be in the middle of the stock
fluctuations over the past 20 years (Hasegawa and Fukui, 2022). However,
for the sustainable use of masu salmon stocks, the, more effective
fish production and release techniques are required.
It has been reported that hatchery-reared and domesticated salmonids
used in release programs have lower survival rates than wild fish
due to a lower ability to adapt to the natural environment (Araki et al.,
2007, 2008; Berejikian and Ford, 2004; McLean et al., 2003). The low
adaptability of domesticated salmonids may have resulted from selection
for traits that are important for hatchery growth and survival but
not for the natural environment (Einum and Fleming, 2001; Solberg
et al., 2015). For example, hatchery-reared juvenile steelhead trout
show reduced predator avoidance compared to wild fish (Berejikian,
1995). Studies using meta-analyses have reported that captive salmonids
are more aggressive and less responsive to predators, resulting in
lower survival rates in the natural environment (Einum and Fleming,
2001). In addition, in masu salmon, the timing of smoltification
(Koyama et al., 2007) and predator avoidance ability (Yamamoto and
Reinhardt, 2003) differ between captive fish and wild individuals. The
behavioral and physiological differences between hatchery and wild fish

can result in the fish competing for habitat, food resources, and breeding
partners. As a consequence, the release of farmed fish may not increase
population sizes; instead, hatchery-derived fish may replace wild conspecifics
(Sahashi et al., 2015). Measures have been taken to reduce the
effects of domestication, such as the use of captive-bred stock that has
not experienced more than one generation in captivity, but this has not
solved the problem. The underlying cause of the competition between
hatchery-derived and wild individuals is unknown. To elucidate the
basis of this problem, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms
that affect juvenile fish survival during early life stages in the natural
environment is required.
In Japan, to correct the release effects caused by such differences in
the characteristics of wild and farmed fish, the creation of semi-wild fish
with wild fish as fathers and farmed fish as mothers has been proposed.
(Japan Fisheries Agency, 2018). Semi-wild fish are more difficult to feed
than hatchery-bred fish during the fry growth period and require more
time and effort to produce. Because farmed fish have a high fecundity
combined with wild fish characteristics, it is thought that a balance can
be achieved in the field after release. The basis of this approach is that
the high reproductive rate of domesticated fish can be complemented by
the adaptability to the natural environment of wild fish. Semi-wild fish
have been reported to have intermediate physiological responses to
environmental stresses compared to hatchery and wild fish (Solberg
et al., 2013). In a study on egg-to-smolt survival in a natural environment
in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), semi-wild fish were reported to
have a lower survival rate than wild fish but a higher survival rate than
farmed fish (Skaala et al., 2012). In white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis),
the survival rate of released semi-wild fish was 2.5 times
higher than that of farmed fish (Yamashita et al., 2020). In turbid water
environments, semi-wild fish have been reported to have a 3.2-fold
higher upstream migration performance than farmed fish (Yamashita
and Suzuki, 2019). An increase in the proportion of genes derived from
wild fish in masu salmon and chum salmon (O. keta) was shown to increase
the wild survival of captive-bred fish (Sahashi and Morita, 2022).
However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding why
semi-wild fish show higher survival rates than farmed fish.
Juvenile salmonid form dominance hierarchies within the rivers they
inhabit (Yamamoto et al., 1998). Ranking in the hierarchy is closely
related to foraging behavior, habitat use, growth, and migration
(Nakano, 1995). Dominant individuals exclusively use the middle and
surface layers of pools as foraging habitats. They have preferential access
to drifting food, resulting in more significant growth and higher
sedentariness than more subordinate individuals (Nakano, 1995). A
study of social status in a hierarchy and physiological responses in juvenile
Atlantic salmon showed a strong correlation between standard
metabolic rate (SMR) and rank in the hierarchy, with higher SMR
indicating higher rank (Metcalfe et al., 1995). This correlation was
influenced by the density of individuals in the habitat, with lower
densities resulting in less aggression and competition, higher mean food
intake and growth rates, and no relationship between SMR and growth
rates (Reid et al., 2011). In other words, at high densities where the
availability of suitable feeding habitat is limited, individuals with high
SMR will have lower growth due to the cost of maintaining their ranking
at the top of the hierarchy. On the other hand, individuals with low SMR
will not secure enough food and will be disadvantaged in the competition
for survival. Thus, the metabolic rate of an individual is an essential
factor that determines its competitiveness for food resources.
Metabolic rate is an essential physiological indicator that determines
survival in the field because behavior such as feeding, escape from
predators and competitors, digestion, growth, and reproduction all
require oxygen (Eliason and Farrell, 2016). Furthermore, the relationship
between current velocity and feeding success is important in drift
feeder habitat selection and hierarchy formation (Bozeman and Grossman,
2019). In other words, the ability to swim to localization is an
important indicator in assessing competitive ability of fish in rivers.
Therefore, we hypothesized that when fish density in a habitat is
increased by release, the higher metabolism of semi-wild fish than that
of released farmed fish will result in a higher ranking in the hierarchy for
semi-wild fish, and as a result, semi-wild fish will be more likely to
become established in their natural environment than farmed fish. According
to our hypothesis, semi-wild fish are more likely to become
established in the natural environment than farmed fish. A semi-wild
fish and a farmed fish were created in this study, both of which have
the same mother and father as wild or farmed fish. We compared the
metabolism and swimming ability of the two groups of fry by means of
swimming respirometry.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Capture of parent fish, artificial insemination, and incubation of
fertilized eggs
All of the researchers who participated in this study have taken an
ethics course on animal experiments at the College of Bioresource Sciences,
Nihon University. All experiments were conducted following the
ethical regulations for animal experiments of the College of Bioresource
Sciences, Nihon University. In this study, the experiment was conducted
on masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) to measure the metabolism and
swimming performance. The experiments were conducted from
November 2018 and November 2019 at Akita Prefectural Institute of
Fisheries. Both wild and farmed fish were used as male parents. The wild
fish were collected in October 2018 and October 2019 using a cast net
and an electrofisher in the Juninosawa Stream, a tributary of the Ani
River, Akita Prefecture (Fig. S1). No artificially hatched individuals have
so far been released into the Juninosawa Stream; thus, the 10 captured
males each year were assumed to be wild fish. Wild fish of resident forms
were used as experimental fish. Fish raised in inland water test ponds at
the Akita Prefectural Institute of Fisheries were used as the farmed fish.
The farmed fish used in the experiment were gametes collected from
masu salmon caught in the Ani River, artificially inseminated, and
reared in inland water test ponds of the Akita Prefectural Institute of
Fisheries. Seven generations of farmed fish were used as parents for the
farmed fish of male and female in 2018. Eight generations of male
farmed fish and four generations of female farmed fish were used as
farmed parents in 2019. Mean total body length and body mass of fish
used as parents were shown in Fig. S2.
The sampled individuals of both sexes were immobilized in FA100
(DS Pharma Animal Health Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), liquid with eugenol
adjusted at 10% to 100 ml of ethanol diluted to 0.5 ml/l in river water,
and then placed on a scale. The left side of the fish was photographed
using a digital camera (Nikon 1 AW1, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). The weight scale was surrounded by a light-shielding sheet in a
1 m cube so that the images of the experimental fish were not affected by
ambient light. After capturing the images, the weights and body sizes of
the experimental fish were measured from the digital images using
ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012).
For animal welfare reasons, both sexes of adult fish were over
anesthetized and euthanized before gametes were extracted. After
photography, the abdomen of each male was dried with a towel and
semen was gently extruded and stored in Whirl-Pak Sample Bags, taking
care to avoid contamination with water, urine, or feces. The sperm
samples were stored in a cooler box maintained at 4 ◦C until used for
fertilization. The abdomen of each female was opened with dissecting
scissors, the eggs were transferred to a bowl, and approximately
150–200 eggs were quickly placed into the ends of two Ziploc containers
(80 mm long x 156 mm wide x 53 mm high) using a mesh strainer.
Semen from wild and farmed fish were used separately for fertilization.
Approximately 100 μl of semen was dropped into the opposite end of the
Ziploc container using a micropipette; 100 ml of spring water was slowly
poured into the container to enable fertilization of the eggs. Fertilized
eggs were allowed to stand for 1 h and then placed in an incubation tank
containing 10 × 10 × 10 cm mesh baskets. Ninety days after hatching,

fish from both groups were transferred to circular tanks (140 cm
diameter and 70 cm height) to reduce density. After yolk absorption, the
fish were provided with formula feed three to five times a day according
to their body size for 371 days in the experiment commenced in 2018
and 291 days in the 2019 experiment. The juveniles of both groups were
separately kept in common environmental conditions to ensure that any
behavioral differences observed during the experiment were due to genetic
rather than environmental differences.
2.2. Metabolism and swimming ability measurement
The juvenile fish generated in November 2018 were subjected to
metabolic and swimming ability measurements in October 2019 at the
Akita Prefectural Institute of Fisheries (hereafter referred to as the 2019
experiment). The juvenile fish generated in November 2019 were moved
to the College of Bioresource Sciences, Nihon University, Fujisawa,
Kanagawa, Japan in August 2020 where they were acclimated in a 9 ◦C
tank for one week (hereafter referred to as the 2020 experiment). A
swim tunnel respirometer (model: 1500 ml, Loligo Systems, Viborg,
Denmark) was used to measure the swimming ability and oxygen consumption
of each individual. The area in which the fish could swim was
55 mm in diameter × 200 mm in length. At the Akita Prefectural
Institute of Fisheries, spring water at about 10 ◦C was circulated through
the respirometer; at the College of Bioresource Sciences, the water was
circulated through a plastic box maintained at 9 ◦C using a cooler to
minimize fluctuations in water temperature during the experiment. In
the swim-tunnel respirometer, the flow velocity was controlled using a
propeller located downstream. Calibration of the velocity was performed
before the fish were in place. Sensors for measuring dissolved
oxygen were installed upstream. Dissolved oxygen was measured at 1 Hz
using a Witrox 1 oxygen meter (Loligo Systems, Viborg, Denmark). To
minimize visual stimulation of the swimming fish, the experimental tank
was covered with black plastic sheets. A small window was created next
to the swimming area to check the swimming conditions during the
experiment. The water was changed for each individual to prevent the
accumulation of nitrogen waste. Changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations
were recorded multiple times in the absence of the fish and the
variation was found to be negligible. The water temperature during the
experiment was adjusted to maintain it within ±1.5 ◦C of the temperature
at the start of the experiment. The metabolic experiments were
conducted from October 3 to November 2 in 2019, from August 2 to
October 14 in 2020. During the experimental period described above,
we started the experiment at 7:00–9:00 a.m. and recorded data from a
maximum of three individuals per day. There were also days when the
experiment could not be conducted during the period. As the fish are
growing during this period, the effects of growth were minimized by
ensuring the order in which the experiments were conducted was not
biased in favor of one group; the experiments were conducted using
individuals from each group in turn. The fish used in the experiment
were fasted for 24 h to minimize the effects of energy consumption
associated with food digestion.
2.3. Experimental protocol
Before starting the experiment, total body lengths (TLs) of the
experimental fish were measured as described in Section 2.1. Experimental
fish were gently placed into the swimming section of the cylinder
to avoid stress. At the beginning of the experiment, the speed of the
water current in the respirometer is set as double the body length of the
fish to remove air bubbles in the swimming area. Acclimation was carried
out for 1 h at a flow rate of 0.5 TL/s. During acclimation, the flow
rate in the swimming area was kept constant and the water was circulated
using a pump to prevent the dissolved oxygen level from significant
decreasing (Fig. S3). If the dissolved oxygen level did not decrease
stably during RMR measurement, we either started from the beginning
or replaced the experimental fish with new ones. Therefore, it took up to
5 h to measure the metabolism of one individual. After acclimation, the
water hole, which connects the swimming area to the circulating water
reservoir, was plugged and the dissolved oxygen concentration was
recorded over a 0.5–1 h period. A flow rate of 0.5 TL/s was maintained
in the respirometer and the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded
after confirming that it was decreasing linearly. Based on the
recorded dissolved oxygen, oxygen consumption (referred to as MO2: mg
O2/h) was calculated from the following equation:
MO2 = [O2]v
where [O2] is the rate of decrease in that concentration in mgO2 L􀀀 1 h􀀀 1,
v is the volume of the swimming area (1.5 L). The rate of decrease in that
concentration was determined by using the slope value approximated by
a linear function from the start time to the end time of the measurement
section. The metabolic rate during this period was defined as the resting
metabolic rate (RMR). The reason is that during this period, the fish
swam slowly and moved their fins lightly to maintain their posture in the
dissolved oxygen meter. On the other hand, SMR is defined as the closest
approximation to basal metabolism when organs are completely still
(Chabot et al., 2016). Therefore, in this study, the metabolic rate
measured during this period was considered RMR. At the flow rate of 0.5
TL/s, the fish rarely swam. After measurement of RMR, the plug was
removed from the water passage hole in the swimming area and the
water was allowed to flow for about 0.5 h to bring the dissolved oxygen
concentration to saturation. At the end of this period when the dissolved
oxygen concentration had returned to the level before the start of the
experiment, the swimming area was again sealed with a plug. Initially,
the flow rate was set to 1.5 TL/s and the experimental fish was able to
swim in this current. The flow rate was then increased by 0.5 TL/s every
10 min; the increase in flow rate induced the fish to swim. When the
experimental fish became tired and began to stay downstream, the fish
were stimulated by exposing them to LED lights. If the fish still could not
swim, the speed at that point was defined as the final speed at which the
fish could no longer swim. The swimming test was terminated when the
fish could not escape from the downstream area for more than 5 s after
doing this. The maximum metabolic rate (MMR) calculated as the oxygen
consumption per unit time during the highest flow rate.; Ucrit is
defined as the highest swimming speed that a fish can maintain during a
defined time interval (Brett, 1964, 1967; Peake et al., 1997). Ucrit is
generally measured as cm/s or TL/s and is calculated as follows (Brett,
1965):
Ucrit = Up+Ui
Tp
Ti
where Up is the velocity at which the fish last swam for the full period, Ui
is the increase in speed (0.5TL/s), Tp is the duration in minutes that the
fish was able to swim against the water velocity that produced fatigue,
and Ti is the time interval at which the speed was increased (10 min). As
the fish were small relative to the cross-sectional area of the swim tunnels,
the Ucrit values were not corrected to account for the solid blocking
effect of the individuals (Bell and Terhune, 1970).
At the end of the experiment, the fish were immobilized using a
0.05% of 2-phenoxyethanol; the weights of the fish were measured to
the nearest 0.1 g as described in Section 2.1.
The relationship between MO2 and swimming speed (U) at each
speed was described using the exponential function:
MO2 = aebU
where a is the metabolic rate at rest or RMR, U is the swimming speed,
and b is a constant (Behrens et al., 2006). The cost of transport (COT) is
expressed in terms of distance traveled per hour (km) as a function of U
using the exponential function:
COT(U) = aebU􀀀 1
Y. Makiguchi et al.
Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part A 275 (2023) 111328
4
COT(U) was calculated and the value at which it became zero was set
as the optimum swimming speed (Uopt) at which the transportation cost
becomes minimum (COTmin; Behrens et al., 2006). Differentiating the
expression of COT(U) once and setting Uopt to the value of U when the
slope of the tangent line becomes zero, we obtain the following
equation.
Uopt = 1/b
COTmin was obtained by inserting Uopt into COT(U).
Water temperature during the swimming experiment was 10.69 ±
0.49 ◦C for semi-wild fish and 11.09 ± 0.78 ◦C for farmed fish in the
2019 experiment, and 8.98 ± 1.20 ◦C for semi-wild fish and 8.79 ±
0.32 ◦C for farmed fish in the 2020 experiment; the differences in temperature
were not significant (t = 1.152, p = 0. 272 for 2019 experiment;
t = 􀀀 0.384, p = 0.704 for 2020 experiment).
2.4. Statistical analysis
Body mass and total body length of fish at the time of experiment
were compared between the semi-wild and farmed fish in the 2019 and
2020 experiments using t-tests. RMR, MMR, Ucrit, Uopt, and COTmin
were used as a single data set for 2019 and 2020 without distinction, and
were compared between semi-wild and farmed fish using linear models.
RMR and MMR were compared between semi-wild and farmed fish using
a linear model with body mass as a covariate. To clarify the comparison
between semi-wild and farmed fish, which was the objective of this
study, a null model was set up with each parameter as response variable
and only year parameter as explanatory variable, and for RMR and
MMR, this null For RMR and MMR, a null model was set up with body
weight as a covariate and type of fish as an explanatory variable, and for
Ucrit, Uopt, and COTmin a model was set up with type of fish as an
explanatory variable. These models were compared by null model and
ANOVA to determine the impact of the added explanatory variables. R
software ver. 3.62 (Team, R Core, 2017) was used for the analysis. A
significance level of 5% was defined as statistically significant.
3. Results
Oxygen consumption increased with increasing speed in the two
groups (Fig. 1(a) for 2019, Fig. 1(b) for 2020). Body weight and caudal
fork lengths did not differ significantly between the two groups of fish in
either experiment (t = 􀀀 0.69, p = 0.51 for body mass in 2019, t = 􀀀 0.28,
p = 0.78 for body mass in 2020, t = 0.02, p = 0.98 for fork length in
2019, t = 0.04, p = 0.97 for fork length in 2020; Table 1). RMR and MMR
were larger in semi-wild than farmed fish (Table 2). Uopt was also larger
in semi-wild fish than farmed fish (Table 2). No differences were found
between semi-wild and farmed fish for Ucrit in TL, Ucrit in cm, and
COTmin (Table 2).
4. Discussion
This study compared the metabolism of semi-wild and farmed fish in
the Ani River, Akita Prefecture, Japan. The physiological differences
between the two types of fish were discussed in terms of their potential
impact on the survival of juvenile salmon after release for the conservation
of masu salmon resources. The swimming and metabolic performances
of semi-wild fish (produced using sperm derived from wild
fish) and of farmed fish (produced using males reared for 6 or 7 generations
in the hatchery) were compared using swimming respirometry as
a possible factor to explain the difference of the survival rate between
farmed and semi-wild fish. The results showed that RMR, MMR, the
upper limit of the maximum metabolic rate and Uopt were smaller in
farmed fish than in semi-wild fish. There was no difference in swimming
ability indexes such as Ucrit and body size between the two groups. RMR
differed between the semi-wild and farmed fish even though the
experimental fish were reared in the same environment, suggesting that
paternal origin had a significant genetic influence. SMR, which was
smaller in farmed fish than in semi-wild fish, has been reported to be an
essential indicator of hierarchical ranking in river life in juvenile
Atlantic salmon (Metcalfe et al., 1995; Reid et al., 2011) and masu
salmon (Yamamoto et al., 1998). Specifically, the higher the SMR, the
higher the position in the hierarchy. As a result, fish at the top of the
hierarchy can acquire better feeding grounds. Socially dominant
salmonid fry grow faster than their subdominant conspecifics (Metcalfe
et al., 1992), and the resulting body size advantage can reinforce social

hierarchies. Previous studies have reported that hatchery salmonid fish
have lower survival rates during the juvenile stage than wild and semiwild
fish (Skaala et al., 2012; Yamashita et al., 2020). In this study, RMR
was measured as an alternative to SMR, but the finding of lower RMR in
farmed fish compared to semi-wild fish in this study may suggest a
mechanism for the reported lower survival rates of farmed fish
compared to that of semi-wild fish. In this scenario, farmed fish with a
relatively low RMR may have a lower social status in river life than semiwild
fish and thus have a lower chance of obtaining suitable feeding
grounds, resulting in lower survival rates for farmed fish compared to
semi-wild fish.
Furthermore, MMR was also higher in semi-wild fish compared to
farmed fish. However, no difference was found in Ucri, which is indicators
of active physiology, swimming performance, and have been
reported to be related with athletic performance and swimming performance
(Plaut, 2001). In other words, the swimming performance of
semi-wild and farmed fish at the sizes examined in this study were
almost identical. Therefore, there may be competition between semiwild
and farmed fish in some areas, such as feeding and escape based
on high swimming performance in the natural environment. In foodconstrained
circumstances such as the natural environment, individuals
with high RMR and MMR may have an advantage in feeding.
Because individuals with high SMR consume food faster (Millidine et al.,
2009), SMR size significantly affects feeding performance in environments
where competition for food occurs. However, SMR becomes less
critical in food-rich environments (Auer et al., 2015). It should be noted
that these results are only indirect evidence of the competitive relationship
between semi-wild and farmed fish, as this study did not
examine semi-wild and farmed fish in an actual river. In future experiments,
it will be necessary to determine the comparative social status of
the semi-wild and farmed fish in the natural environment and how this
impacts their interactions.
Uopt, the swimming speed based on aerobic exercise, which is the
most energy-efficient unit transportation cost, was greater in semi-wild
fish than in farmed fish. On the other hand, there was no difference
between the two groups in Ucrit, the critical point from aerobic to
anaerobic exercise; Ucrit is faster than Uopt and is not suitable for
prolonged swimming. A study comparing the Ucrit of wild and farmed
fish reported no difference between the two (Dunmall and Schreer,
2003), implying that semi-wild fish with fast Uopt can cruise at a
somewhat higher speed than farmed fish in riverine living conditions
and currents. Considering these results, semi-wild fish may have an
advantage over farmed fish in food requirements and territorial disputes.
However, there is competition between semi-wild and farmed fish
in natural environments with various velocity zones. The habitat preferences
of juvenile salmonids vary among seasons (Nagayama and
Nakamura, 2007), with juvenile salmonids preferring deep water and
relatively high-velocity areas during the late summer and fall seasons.
Juvenile salmonids are primarily sedentary foragers receiving a
continuous supply of drifting invertebrates such as euphausiid larvae
(Keeley and Grant, 1997). Therefore, individuals that can hold their
position in fast currents are more efficient at foraging for drifting invertebrates
and have an advantage for survival (Nakano, 1995). The
efficiency of foraging by juvenile fish increases when the current is faster
and the water is deeper (H¨ojesj¨o et al., 2016). Converting Uopt to cm/s
units (Nielsen, 1992), Uopt was 36.4 cm/s for semi-wild fish and 28.0
cm/s for farmed fish in 2019, and 29.2 cm/s for semi-wild fish and 21.2
cm/s for farmed fish in 2020. Although differences in Uopt due to body
size effects must be taken into account, Sato et al. (2016) reported that in
the Juninosawa Stream, where the wild masu salmon used in this study
were captured, the fish showed reproductive behavior in conditions with
an average flow velocity of 33.3 cm/s. Although the spawning grounds
and fry habitat did not exactly coincide, the Uopt of the semi-wild fish
was closer to the average velocity of the river than that of the farmed
fish. This suggests that semi-wild fish are more likely than farmed fish to
maintain position in a fast-flowing current in order to sustain efficient
foraging.
In this study, COTmin, the oxygen consumption per unit time and
distance in Uopt, did not differ between hatchery and semi-wild fish.
This result implies that the swimming cost of farmed fish is inefficiently
high when they swim at the same speed as the semi-wild fish, suggesting
that they may be less competitive in food acquisition. Thus, semi-wild
fish can maintain their positions in faster currents than farmed fish,
giving them an advantage in food acquisition. This ability may explain
why semi-wild fish have a higher survival rate in natural rivers than
farmed fish.
The fish were older at the time of testing in 2019 than in 2020, but
there was no difference in average age, weight or length between semiwild
and farmed fish in either experiment. There was no difference in
weight and length between semi-wild and farmed fish in each experiment.
Growth and survival rates of juveniles have been reported to be
unaffected by the availability of food under the semi-natural conditions
in which the experiments were conducted (Robertsen et al., 2019). Semiwild
fish also consume more food than farmed fish of the same species
(Hatanp¨a¨a et al., 2020). The fry used in the present study were produced
by fertilization of eggs on the same day and reared under the same
environmental conditions with adequate feeding; the absence of any
difference in growth between the semi-wild and farmed fish is consistent
with previous studies. Hatcheries are selected to be rich in food resources
and to have high juvenile fish growth rates (Gross, 1998).
However, it is unclear how fry growth varies between the two groups in
natural environments where sufficient food is not always available.
Under such conditions, fish have been reported to prioritize growth
promotion over increases in metabolic rates (Bochdansky et al., 2005).
There is a trade-off between metabolic rate and growth; because food is
more restricted in natural than farmed environments, semi-wild fish
with higher SMRs than farmed fish have higher food requirements,
which may lead to insufficient resources and reduced growth under
overcrowded conditions after release (Biro and Stamps, 2008; Ridgway,
2008). When semi-wild and farmed fish are released into the natural
environment, the number of fish to be released must be determined
based on the environmental carrying capacity, i.e., by considering the
potential amount of food available to the fish. Otherwise, the growth of
the semi-wild fish may be reduced due to competition for food. Although
released semi-wild fish have a lower survival rate in the juvenile stage

from their natural habitat (McGinnity et al., 2003). This kind of
competition may also occur between semi-wild and farmed fish.
Although the survival rate of semi-wild fish is 2.5 times higher than that
of farmed fish in the natural environment (Yamashita et al., 2020), semiwild
fish have a lower survival rate than wild fish (Skaala et al., 2012). It
is therefore better to release semi-wild fish than fully farmed fish, but the
effectiveness of the release may be reduced due to competition with
native wild fish.
The results of this study clearly show a difference in RMR between
semi-wild and farmed fish. When releasing semi-wild or farmed fish, it is
necessary to carefully examine the food resources in the habitat and to
determine in advance the appropriate number of fish to be released to
avoid generating food shortages. In addition, from the perspective of
maintaining resources in rivers, the results of this study also indicate
that it is better to use sperm from wild fish when generating fish for
release. Most fish released in mountain stream fisheries in Japan,
including masu salmon, have been derived from hatchery reared fish
because of the relative ease of their production under artificial,
controlled environments. Based on the results of this study, it is clearly
more desirable to produce and release semi-wild fish in light of their
competitive behavior with farmed and wild fish in rivers.
