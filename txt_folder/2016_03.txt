The present paper introduces a new rapid, relevant and reliable (R3) test to predict the pozzolanic activity of
calcined clays with kaolinite contents ranging from 0 to 95%. The test is based on the correlation between the
chemical reactivity of calcined clays in a simplified system and the compressive strength of blends in standard
mortar. The simplified system consists of calcined clay portlandite and limestone pastes with sulfate and alkali
levels adjusted to reproduce the reaction environment of hydrating blended cements. The pastes were hydrated
for 6 days at 20 °C or for 1 day at 40 °C. The chemical reactivity of the calcined clay can be obtained first by
measurement of the heat release during reaction using isothermal calorimetry and second by bound water
determination in a heating step between 110 °C and 400 °C.
Very good correlations were found between the mortar compressive strength and both measures of chemical
reactivity.

1. Introduction
Among Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), calcined
clays are a promising route to increase average levels of clinker substitution.
The global supplies of fly ash and slag are limited compared to the
amount of clinker produced and a very high proportion of suitable slag
and fly ash is already used in blended cements. Kaolinitic clays showthe
highest pozzolanic reactivity [1,2]. Their thermal activation at around
650–800 °C leads to the formation of a disordered highly reactive
phase (AS2) called metakaolin [3].We already showed that a combination
of calcined clay and limestone can replace up to 50% of clinker in
blends which had similar mechanical properties to a plain clinker
cement after only 7 days [4] and that good performance can also be
obtained with impure clays [5,6]. The wide availability of impure
kaolinitic clays makes them interesting candidates to further decrease
the economic and environmental costs of cement production.
During cement hydration, the metakaolin phase reacts with
portlandite, water and/or sulfates to form C-A-S-H, ettringite, AFmmonosulfoaluminate
and/or strätlingite [7].When clinker is substituted
by a combination of calcined clay and limestone, the limestone can react
with the additional aluminate provided by the metakaolin and
portlandite to form AFm-carboaluminates (hemi and mono). Antoni
et al. [4] showed that the combined formation of extra C-A-S-H,
ettringite and carboaluminates in the pozzolanic reaction leads to a refinement
of themicroporosity and an increase in compressive strength.
Themain purpose of this paper is the development of a test method
to evaluate widely available lower-grade kaolinitic clays which have a
more realistic economic potential to be used in blended cements
compared to pure metakaolin, which is considerably more expensive
than clinker.
To evaluate the pozzolanic reactivity of SCMs, a range of test
methods has been proposed in literature, mostly based on portlandite
consumption [8–11]. However, these tests often do not correlate well
with compressive strength. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel
rapid, relevant and reliable (R3) testing approach for assessing calcined
clay reactivity. Twowayswere studied to assess reactivity. The first is by
measuring the heat release of the exothermal hydration reactions by
isothermal calorimetry. Alternatively, since such equipment is not
available in all laboratories, a simple thermogravimetric method can
be used to determine the bound water content in the range 110 °C to
400 °C with an oven.
The basis of the test is a paste of calcined clay (and limestone) with
portlandite andwater,with sulfate and alkali levels adjusted to simulate
the chemical environment of a hydrating blend.
For a wide range of calcined kaolinitic clays, the R3 test results were
compared to relative strengths based on standard compressive strength
on mortar bars. Finally, the modified Chapelle test was run in order to
compare the R3 test to a commonly used existing testing method.

2. Materials andmethods
2.1. Material characterization
Seven different clays of varying kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) contents
sourced from around the world were used in this study. Clays were
first crushed and then ground using a disk mill (Siebtechnik TS250)
for 1 min. Most of the clays were calcined in our laboratory,
about 1 kg per batch, in alumina crucibles at 800 °C for 1 h in a hightemperature
furnace (Borel FP1100). This calcination temperature was
chosen to ensure complete dehydroxylation of kaolinite and to get the
highest pozzolanic potential of calcined clay [1,5]. Some of the clays
were calcined by external companies using flash or static calcination.
The initial kaolinite content of each raw clay wt.%kaolinite was
calculated according to Eq. (1) by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
from the weight loss over the kaolinite dehydroxylation interval 400–
600 °C [5,12], defined as wt.%kaol-OH, where Mkaolinite and Mwater stand
for the molecular mass of kaolinite and water, respectively.

ð1Þ
A source of error of the kaolinite content determination by TGA can
come from the presence ofmuscovite or illite as secondary phases in the
claywhich also partially dehydroxylate over this temperature range [1].
However, XRD analyses indicate that the amounts of these phases are
minor, and besides, the dehydroxylation of these phases occurs on a
wider temperature range [5].
TGA experiments were also run on all calcined clays to assess the
calcination efficiency. Some of the clays calcined by the material supplier
were found not to be entirely dehydroxylated. Consequently the
calcined kaolinite content was defined as the part of kaolinite which
was dehydroxylated during the calcination process. This parameter
was calculated by taking the difference between the kaolinite content
before and after calcination, as shown in Eq. (2).

The physico-chemical properties of the calcined clays are given in
Table 1. The properties of the Portland cement used for the compressive
strength tests and the limestone are also presented in Table 1. Malvern
laser diffractometer was used to determine the dv,50. The limestone
used was Durcal 5 from Omya Company. The Portland cement was a
commercial clinker especially ground with anhydrite from Heidelberg
Cement, classified as CEMI 42.5R. Table 2 shows the phase composition
of the cement used.
2.2. Mortar strength tests
Standard mortars were cast in order to determine the strength development
of the blends. Two substitution levels of Portland cement
were studied. The PPC30 systemrefers to systemswith 30% of substitution
by calcined clays, 65% of clinker and 5% of gypsum. The LC3-501
system refers to cements with 45% of substitution of Portland cement
by 30% of calcined clay and 15% of limestone, with a clinker content of
50% and 5% of gypsum. The composition of the different systems is summarized
in Table 3. Previous work demonstrated that a calcined clay to
limestone ratio of 2:1 gave the best compressive strength development
[6]. The addition of gypsum was chosen in order to prevent the system
being undersulfated and to optimize early-age strengths. This gypsum
adjustment was determined by isothermal calorimetry. Gypsum was
added until the separation of silicate and aluminate peaks could be
distinguished on heat flow curves. In general the optimal addition was
found to be 2% gypsum in addition to that already added during grinding
of the clinker. Thus, the 5% of gypsum present in PPC30 and LC3-50
blends corresponds to the sum of the initial sulfate from cement and
this addition of 2%. A 98% + grade gypsum from Acros company was
used for all blends.
Mortar barswere cast using a water to cement ratio of 0.5 according
to EN-196-1 [13]. Polycarboxylate superplasticizer (max. 0.6wt.% of the
total solid excluding sand) was used to ensure comparable workability
with PC. The mortar bars were unmoulded after 1 day and cured in a
fog room until tested. The compressive strength measurements were
carried out on mortar cubes of 40 × 40 × 40 mm at 1, 3, 7, 28 and
90 days after casting.

2.3. Mix design of the R3 test
The basis of the R3 test is to use a simplified system to isolate the
reaction of the calcined clay from that of the clinker. The three main
components of the simplified system are calcined clay, portlandite
and, in the LC3-50 system, limestone. In the LC3-50 pastes an identical
ratio of calcined clay to limestone of 2:1 was used. A water to solid
ratio of 1.2 was used for all systems in order to provide excess water
for the hydration reactions and to obtain a fluid homogeneous paste.
The aim of the simulated systems was to reproduce the reaction
environment of the calcined clay in a real blended cement as closely
as possible, without actually incorporating hydrating clinker phases as
this would introduce variability according to the clinker used. Therefore,
soluble alkalis and sulfate were added 1) to reproduce the cement pore
solution pH and accelerate the pozzolanic reaction and 2) to lead to the
formation of similar reaction products as in real blended cements, such
as C-A-S-H gel, ettringite and AFm phases.
In a first step in the development of the R3 test mix design the effect
of alkali and sulfate additions was evaluated. Four different addition
levels were investigated for both alkalis and sulfate. Potassium hydroxide
and potassiumsulfatewere added to deionizedwater to adjust these
parameters, varying the pH of the mix solution from 13.3 to 13.7. To
evaluate the effect of the portlandite to calcined clay ratio five different
mass ratioswere selected. The mix design adjustment is summarized in
Table 4. Pure potassium sulfate and potassiumhydroxidewere supplied
by Reactolab and Fischer Scientific, respectively. Portlanditewas provided
by Roth company, with a grade of 96% min.
The variations in mix design were tested at 20 °C on two calcined
clays of differing calcined clay content, i.e. clays 1 and 4. Only results
of clay 1 are shown in the paper, the results of clay 4 showed identical
trends and are available as supplemental material.
Once the optimal mix design had been chosen, the pozzolanic
reactivity test was applied to the whole set of calcined clays. Tests
were carried out in systems without and with limestone for correlation
to the relative strength results of the PPC30 and LC3-50 systems,
respectively.
3. Methods
3.1. Heat flow measurements using isothermal calorimetry
The cumulative heat of reaction was measured in an isothermal
calorimeter (TAM Air) both over 7 days at 20 °C and 40 °C. The increase
in temperature speeds up the pozzolanic reaction, but maintains the
same hydrate assemblage [14–16]. All the paste ingredients, including
the mixing solutions were stored overnight at the same temperature
as the test. About 110 g of the paste was then mixed at 1600 rpm
for 2 min and 15 g of the paste was poured into a glass ampoule, which
was closed and placed inside the calorimeter. Accompanying samples
from the same batch were cast for XRD and cured at 20 °C and 40 °C.
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the crystalline
phases formed and to follow the portlandite consumption. Measurements
were carried out on freshly cut paste slices at 1, 4 and 7 days.
The slices were mounted on a XRD sample holder and measured in
Bragg–Brentano mode using a X'Pert PANalytical diffractometer with
CuKα source operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. Samples were scanned
from 7 to 70 °2θ with a step size of 0.0167 °2θ using a X'Celerator
detector, resulting in an equivalent time per step of 30 s.
3.2. Bound water determination using oven thermal treatment
Since not all laboratories are equipped with an isothermal calorimeter,
an alternative technique based on bound water determination is
developed to assess the calcined clay reactivity. After mixing the paste
samples are cast in plastic containers and sealed at 40 °C for 1 day to reproduce
the same conditions as the tests carried out at 40 °C using isothermal
calorimetry. Then, three 4 mm-thick slices were cut for each
system using a diamond saw. The slices were dried at 110 °C in an
oven from Salvis company. Samples were considered dry when the
mass change within 1 day did not exceed 0.5%, according to ASTM
C642, this condition was fulfilled after 2 days of drying. Finally, the

bound water was determined according to Eq. (3) by calculating the
mass change after heating the samples at 400 °C for 2 h and cooling
it down to 110 °C. The thermal treatment was limited to 400 °C since
higher temperatures would lead to portlandite dehydroxylation,
which is not desired in this case.

3.3. Modified Chapelle test
To compare the new test to existing method, the modified Chapelle
test was run on the different calcined clays according to NF P18-513
[17]. This test was chosen due to the fact that it is claimed to give a
quick indication of pozzolanic reactivity, within a day. For this test, 1 g
of calcined clay was mixed with 2 g of calcium oxide and 250 mL of
deionized water. Blank samples were also prepared without calcined
clay and run in parallel to the calcined clay samples. The mixwas heated
at 90 °C for 16 h.Water loss was prevented by a reflux condenser. After
cooling down to 20 °C, a solution of 60 g of sucrose in 250 mL of deionized
water was added to complex the calcium ions in solution and to
dissolve the unreacted portlandite. The suspensionwas filtered through
a Büchner filter and the liquid was titrated with a 0.1 M solution of HCl
using phenolphthalein as pH indicator. Fromthe volume of HCl solution
added, the amount of mg of bound portlandite was determined according
to Eq. (4),where V1 and V2 are the volume of HCl added for the titration
of the blank sample and the samplewith calcined clay, respectively.

4. Results
4.1. Mortar compressive strength
In Figs. 1 and 2, the compressive strengths of the PPC30 and LC3-50
mortars and their strengths relative to the unblended reference cement
are shown as a function of the calcined kaolinite content of the calcined
clays. On the graph of the strength (Fig. 1) the plain PC strengths are indicated
by dotted lines. Already, after 3 days the blend containing the
calcined clay with the very high calcined kaolinite content (95%) is
equivalent to the reference plain Portland cement. For the other ages
(7 days and later), 100% of the reference strength is obtained for blends
containing calcined clay with calcined kaolinite content of around 40%.
Strength values for PC and PPC30 and LC3-50 blends containing 38.9%
and 95% are shown in Table 5 for more precise comparison.
Moreover, strengths of both PPC30 and LC3-50 systems are linearly
correlated with the calcined kaolinite content of calcined clays. This

shows that for different clays from various areas with different compositions,
secondary phases, fineness and specific surfaces, the strength
results are almost exclusively dependent on one parameter only: the
calcined kaolinite content. Furthermore, the LC3-50 systems have
strengths close to those of the PPC30 systems in spite of their higher replacement
ratio (lower clinker content). The LC3-50 blends benefit from
the synergetic addition of calcined clay togetherwith limestone, leading
to the formation of more hydrates from the SCMs.
4.2. Optimization of parameters for R3 pozzolanic activity tests
4.2.1. Sulfate to calcined clay ratio
Fig. 3 shows the heat released per gram of solid by isothermal
calorimetry for calcined clay 1 for the four sulfate to calcined clay
mass ratios (cf. Table 4). For systems with higher sulfate content,
i.e. 0.06 and 0.08 sulfate to calcined clay ratios, an early heat flow peak
appears before 15 h of reaction. XRD patterns at 1 day of hydration
indicate that ettringite was formed in these systems. In the low sulfate
systems, no early heat flow peak was observed and XRD results did
not show the formation of ettringite. In the systems with low sulfate
content the sulfate is rapidly depleted by the calcined kaolinite pozzolanic
reaction, consuming Al to formAFmphases (mainly Hc) rather than
ettringite. The second peak in the calorimetry curves is related to C-A-SH
and AFm formation. Fig. 4 shows the cumulative heat released at
1 day, 2 days and 6 days for the different sulfate to calcined clay ratios
for the calcined clays 1 (95% of calcined kaolinite) and 4 (50.8% of calcined
kaolinite). The cumulative heat does not significantly change
with the sulfate content. The highest heat release is reached for the
system with 0.06 sulfate to calcined clay ratio.
Thus, the final sulfate to calcined clay ratio for the pozzolanic reactivity
test chosen was 0.06. This ratio was selected because 1) early
ettringite formation is a general and desirable feature of cement hydration,
and 2) the highest heat release is obtained for this ratio, indicating
that higher sulfate levels slow down the pozzolanic reaction.

4.2.2. Alkali to calcined clay ratio
The heat released per gram of solid for the four different alkali to
calcined clay mass ratios (cf. Table 4) is shown in Fig. 5 for the calcined
clay 1. An early heat flow peak related to ettringite formation was observed
only for the two lowest alkali to calcined clay ratios, i.e. 0.06
and 0.08. This was confirmed by XRD. As expected the pozzolanic reaction
of calcined kaolinite is enhanced inmore alkaline solutions as seen
from the increasing height of the main calorimetry peak [7,18]. AFm
phases form rather than ettringite for high alkaline solutions due to
the decrease of the ion activity product for ettringite with increasing
pH [19]. The alkali U-phase is not observed because this phase only occurs
for pH higher than 14 [20].
The final alkali to calcined clay ratio was chosen at 0.08 to enable
both ettringite formation and high calcined clay reactivity.
4.2.3. Portlandite to calcined clay ratio
The effect of changing the portlandite to calcined clay ratio was investigated
using the sulfate and alkali ratios previously determined
(0.06 and 0.08, respectively). Calorimetry curves are shown in Fig. 6
for calcined clay 1. The results show that the cumulative heat release
reaches a plateau for systems having portlandite to calcined clay mass
ratios of 1/1, 1/2 and 1/3. The plateau is reached sooner and at a lower
cumulative heat release for mixes with lower portlandite contents.
The XRD patterns at 4 days demonstrate the absence of portlandite in
all mixes that reached the plateau.
The extent of reaction of the calcined clay depends on the amount of
portlandite available as reactant. As soon as portlandite is completely
consumed, a plateau is reached and overall reaction rates are reduced.
In order to assess the intrinsic reactivity of the calcined clays, it was
decided to use a 3/1 ratio for the mix design. This way the portlandite
reactant will always be in excess and the main factor controlling the
reaction kinetics is the calcined clay. The resulting optimal mix design
developed for the new pozzolanic reactivity test is presented in Table 6.
4.3. Application of the R3 test to calcined clays: heat flow measurements
4.3.1. Tests carried out at 20 °C
The heat released per gram of solid during hydration of all the calcined
clays studied is presented in Figs. 7 and 8 for systems without
and with limestone, respectively. In both cases, the calcined clay 1
with 95% of calcined kaolinite content reacts the most, whereas the
quartz system is the least reactive. These results are in agreement
with the compressive strength results. For systems without limestone,
XRD patterns clearly show the formation of monosulfoaluminate
phase for all systems at 7 days, due to the absence of calcite. An AFm
solid solution sulfate, carbonate and hydroxide together (discussed by
Pöllmann [21]) also forms as seen by the peak at 10.5 °2θ (CuKα).
Ettringite forms at earlier ages, but with the continuing dissolution of
the calcined clay, the aluminate to sulfate ratio increases, leading to
the consumption of ettringite and the formation ofmonosulfoaluminate
phase. For systemswith limestone, carboaluminates form and ettringite
remains present in the systems, as shown in Fig. 8.Moreover, the height
of the peaks of the carboaluminates increase with the calcined kaolinite
content of calcined clays.
To compare with the relative strength results from 1 to 90 days, cumulative
heat values were taken at 6 days of reaction because the reaction
significantly slows down at this age. Fig. 9 shows that good linear
correlations are obtained at all ages between the heat released and the
strengths for both PPC30 and LC3-50 systems.
4.3.2. Impact of temperature
Figs. 10 and 11 showthat increasing the temperature for the isothermal
calorimetry from20 to 40 °C accelerates the pozzolanic reaction. No
major change in phase assemblage is observed at 1 day, except for the
ettringite peaks which are lower or absent for systems with limestone.
This is likely due to the acceleration of the pozzolanic reaction of
metakaolin and the increase of ettringite solubility with temperature
[19]. The heat released after only 1 day at 40 °C is globally similar to
the heat released at 6 days at 20 °C and the heat evolution also slows
down at this time. Thus, the correlations to relative strengths are
based on the 1 day heat values. Fig. 12 shows that similar correlation coefficients
are obtained at the higher temperature.
4.3.3. Repeatability
To control the repeatability of the R3 test, three independent tests
were carried out on clay 4, with and without limestone, as shown in
Fig. 13. The standard deviations were calculated based on the heat
values at 6 days and 1 day for tests run at 20 °C and 40 °C, respectively.

Their values are shown in Table 7. The standard deviations are very
small.
4.4. Bound water determination
Fig. 14 shows that linear correlations are obtained between relative
strength and boundwater for systemswithout andwith limestone, similar
to the correlations with the heat released at 1 day. Therefore, the
bound water indicator is also a relevant method to predict the strength
development of blends. Moreover, the correlation with the heat release
values at 1 day for systemswithout andwith limestone in Fig. 15 clearly
shows the reliability of the R3 test using the boundwater determination.
4.5. Comparison with the modified Chapelle test
Fig. 16 shows the portlandite consumption for the calcined clays
ranked in order of their calcined kaolinite content. The consumption
of portlandite globally increases with the calcined kaolinite content.

Also the quartz systemshows someportlandite consumption, this is due
to the elevated temperature of the test. This pozzolanic reactivity of
quartz has already been observed for blends at 80 °C [22]. The prediction
of strengths based on themodified Chapelle test is also good, somewhat
more scatter is observed for higher calcined kaolinite contents, as
shown in Fig. 17. Finally, the comparison with the heat released at
1 day and the bound water from the R3 test in Fig. 18 shows that the
portlandite consumption is well correlated with the outputs of the R3
test. Thus, the new R3 test provides at least similarly reliable indications
of the reactivity of calcined kaolinitic clays than the modified Chapelle
test. In comparison to the modified Chapelle test which is performed
at 90 °C and without addition of alkali or sulfate the proposed R3 tests
are closer to the reaction environment in Portland cement system.
5. Conclusion
This study shows that similar compressive strengths to plain PC are
obtained for calcined clays with a calcined kaolinite content ≥40% from

7 days onwards, demonstrating the feasibility of using low-grade kaolinitic
calcined clays as cement substituent, even for LC3-50 blends containing
only 50% of clinker. The strengths of PPC30 and LC3-50 blends
linearly increase with the calcined kaolinite content of calcined clays
at all the ages from 1 to 90 days. The calcined kaolinite content parameter
is the overwhelming factor determining strength development accounting
formore than 95% of the variation from7 days onwards. Other
factors, such as the secondary phases present, fineness,method of calcination
do not account for more than 5% of the variability.
For the development of the newR3 test, the mix designwas adjusted
in order to reproduce typical conditions for cement systems. The
optimal mix design was 0.06 SO3/Calcined clay and 0.08 K2O/Calcined
clay mass ratios in order to ensure high pozzolanic reactivity.
Portlandite to calcined clay mass ratio was fixed to 3 so as not to run
out of portlandite.
The R3 test using isothermal calorimetry gives a rapid indication of
calcined clay reactivity, after 6 days for tests carried out at 20 °C and
1 day at 40 °C. Linear correlations with compressive strengths are
obtained for all ages, proving the relevance of this test. Increasing the
testing temperature to 40 °C does not affect the correlations and it is
therefore considered to be a valid way of reducing the test duration
from6 days to 1 day. Small variability ensures good reliability for this test.
The R3 test using boundwater determination after heating to 400 °C
shows very closely-related results to the heat released at 1 day. Bound
water values are linearly correlated to strength results. The bound
water determination method does not require any specific equipment

except an oven able to reach 400 °C. Despite its slightly longer experiment
time (2.5–3 days instead of 1 day for the calorimetry experiment),
this method can be applied in nearly all laboratories with basic
equipment.
Similar correlations to the existing modified Chapelle test are
obtained for the R3 test, bringing the R3 test as an alternative testing
method which is more practical and closer to reaction conditions in
real Portland cement systems.
Thus, the R3 test outputs are found to be well correlated with the
compressive strength, supporting the use of the new test as a predictive
tool for compressive strength at both the short and the long term. A parallel
testing programhas shown the potential of this rapid test for other
kinds of SCMs such as slag, natural pozzolans or fly ashes [23].

The present paper introduces a new rapid, relevant and reliable (R3) test to predict the pozzolanic activity of
calcined clays with kaolinite contents ranging from 0 to 95%. The test is based on the correlation between the
chemical reactivity of calcined clays in a simplified system and the compressive strength of blends in standard
mortar. The simplified system consists of calcined clay portlandite and limestone pastes with sulfate and alkali
levels adjusted to reproduce the reaction environment of hydrating blended cements. The pastes were hydrated
for 6 days at 20 °C or for 1 day at 40 °C. The chemical reactivity of the calcined clay can be obtained first by
measurement of the heat release during reaction using isothermal calorimetry and second by bound water
determination in a heating step between 110 °C and 400 °C.
Very good correlations were found between the mortar compressive strength and both measures of chemical
reactivity.

1. Introduction
Among Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), calcined
clays are a promising route to increase average levels of clinker substitution.
The global supplies of fly ash and slag are limited compared to the
amount of clinker produced and a very high proportion of suitable slag
and fly ash is already used in blended cements. Kaolinitic clays showthe
highest pozzolanic reactivity [1,2]. Their thermal activation at around
650–800 °C leads to the formation of a disordered highly reactive
phase (AS2) called metakaolin [3].We already showed that a combination
of calcined clay and limestone can replace up to 50% of clinker in
blends which had similar mechanical properties to a plain clinker
cement after only 7 days [4] and that good performance can also be
obtained with impure clays [5,6]. The wide availability of impure
kaolinitic clays makes them interesting candidates to further decrease
the economic and environmental costs of cement production.
During cement hydration, the metakaolin phase reacts with
portlandite, water and/or sulfates to form C-A-S-H, ettringite, AFmmonosulfoaluminate
and/or strätlingite [7].When clinker is substituted
by a combination of calcined clay and limestone, the limestone can react
with the additional aluminate provided by the metakaolin and
portlandite to form AFm-carboaluminates (hemi and mono). Antoni
et al. [4] showed that the combined formation of extra C-A-S-H,
ettringite and carboaluminates in the pozzolanic reaction leads to a refinement
of themicroporosity and an increase in compressive strength.
Themain purpose of this paper is the development of a test method
to evaluate widely available lower-grade kaolinitic clays which have a
more realistic economic potential to be used in blended cements
compared to pure metakaolin, which is considerably more expensive
than clinker.
To evaluate the pozzolanic reactivity of SCMs, a range of test
methods has been proposed in literature, mostly based on portlandite
consumption [8–11]. However, these tests often do not correlate well
with compressive strength. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel
rapid, relevant and reliable (R3) testing approach for assessing calcined
clay reactivity. Twowayswere studied to assess reactivity. The first is by
measuring the heat release of the exothermal hydration reactions by
isothermal calorimetry. Alternatively, since such equipment is not
available in all laboratories, a simple thermogravimetric method can
be used to determine the bound water content in the range 110 °C to
400 °C with an oven.
The basis of the test is a paste of calcined clay (and limestone) with
portlandite andwater,with sulfate and alkali levels adjusted to simulate
the chemical environment of a hydrating blend.
For a wide range of calcined kaolinitic clays, the R3 test results were
compared to relative strengths based on standard compressive strength
on mortar bars. Finally, the modified Chapelle test was run in order to
compare the R3 test to a commonly used existing testing method.

2. Materials andmethods
2.1. Material characterization
Seven different clays of varying kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) contents
sourced from around the world were used in this study. Clays were
first crushed and then ground using a disk mill (Siebtechnik TS250)
for 1 min. Most of the clays were calcined in our laboratory,
about 1 kg per batch, in alumina crucibles at 800 °C for 1 h in a hightemperature
furnace (Borel FP1100). This calcination temperature was
chosen to ensure complete dehydroxylation of kaolinite and to get the
highest pozzolanic potential of calcined clay [1,5]. Some of the clays
were calcined by external companies using flash or static calcination.
The initial kaolinite content of each raw clay wt.%kaolinite was
calculated according to Eq. (1) by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
from the weight loss over the kaolinite dehydroxylation interval 400–
600 °C [5,12], defined as wt.%kaol-OH, where Mkaolinite and Mwater stand
for the molecular mass of kaolinite and water, respectively.

ð1Þ
A source of error of the kaolinite content determination by TGA can
come from the presence ofmuscovite or illite as secondary phases in the
claywhich also partially dehydroxylate over this temperature range [1].
However, XRD analyses indicate that the amounts of these phases are
minor, and besides, the dehydroxylation of these phases occurs on a
wider temperature range [5].
TGA experiments were also run on all calcined clays to assess the
calcination efficiency. Some of the clays calcined by the material supplier
were found not to be entirely dehydroxylated. Consequently the
calcined kaolinite content was defined as the part of kaolinite which
was dehydroxylated during the calcination process. This parameter
was calculated by taking the difference between the kaolinite content
before and after calcination, as shown in Eq. (2).

The physico-chemical properties of the calcined clays are given in
Table 1. The properties of the Portland cement used for the compressive
strength tests and the limestone are also presented in Table 1. Malvern
laser diffractometer was used to determine the dv,50. The limestone
used was Durcal 5 from Omya Company. The Portland cement was a
commercial clinker especially ground with anhydrite from Heidelberg
Cement, classified as CEMI 42.5R. Table 2 shows the phase composition
of the cement used.
2.2. Mortar strength tests
Standard mortars were cast in order to determine the strength development
of the blends. Two substitution levels of Portland cement
were studied. The PPC30 systemrefers to systemswith 30% of substitution
by calcined clays, 65% of clinker and 5% of gypsum. The LC3-501
system refers to cements with 45% of substitution of Portland cement
by 30% of calcined clay and 15% of limestone, with a clinker content of
50% and 5% of gypsum. The composition of the different systems is summarized
in Table 3. Previous work demonstrated that a calcined clay to
limestone ratio of 2:1 gave the best compressive strength development
[6]. The addition of gypsum was chosen in order to prevent the system
being undersulfated and to optimize early-age strengths. This gypsum
adjustment was determined by isothermal calorimetry. Gypsum was
added until the separation of silicate and aluminate peaks could be
distinguished on heat flow curves. In general the optimal addition was
found to be 2% gypsum in addition to that already added during grinding
of the clinker. Thus, the 5% of gypsum present in PPC30 and LC3-50
blends corresponds to the sum of the initial sulfate from cement and
this addition of 2%. A 98% + grade gypsum from Acros company was
used for all blends.
Mortar barswere cast using a water to cement ratio of 0.5 according
to EN-196-1 [13]. Polycarboxylate superplasticizer (max. 0.6wt.% of the
total solid excluding sand) was used to ensure comparable workability
with PC. The mortar bars were unmoulded after 1 day and cured in a
fog room until tested. The compressive strength measurements were
carried out on mortar cubes of 40 × 40 × 40 mm at 1, 3, 7, 28 and
90 days after casting.

2.3. Mix design of the R3 test
The basis of the R3 test is to use a simplified system to isolate the
reaction of the calcined clay from that of the clinker. The three main
components of the simplified system are calcined clay, portlandite
and, in the LC3-50 system, limestone. In the LC3-50 pastes an identical
ratio of calcined clay to limestone of 2:1 was used. A water to solid
ratio of 1.2 was used for all systems in order to provide excess water
for the hydration reactions and to obtain a fluid homogeneous paste.
The aim of the simulated systems was to reproduce the reaction
environment of the calcined clay in a real blended cement as closely
as possible, without actually incorporating hydrating clinker phases as
this would introduce variability according to the clinker used. Therefore,
soluble alkalis and sulfate were added 1) to reproduce the cement pore
solution pH and accelerate the pozzolanic reaction and 2) to lead to the
formation of similar reaction products as in real blended cements, such
as C-A-S-H gel, ettringite and AFm phases.
In a first step in the development of the R3 test mix design the effect
of alkali and sulfate additions was evaluated. Four different addition
levels were investigated for both alkalis and sulfate. Potassium hydroxide
and potassiumsulfatewere added to deionizedwater to adjust these
parameters, varying the pH of the mix solution from 13.3 to 13.7. To
evaluate the effect of the portlandite to calcined clay ratio five different
mass ratioswere selected. The mix design adjustment is summarized in
Table 4. Pure potassium sulfate and potassiumhydroxidewere supplied
by Reactolab and Fischer Scientific, respectively. Portlanditewas provided
by Roth company, with a grade of 96% min.
The variations in mix design were tested at 20 °C on two calcined
clays of differing calcined clay content, i.e. clays 1 and 4. Only results
of clay 1 are shown in the paper, the results of clay 4 showed identical
trends and are available as supplemental material.
Once the optimal mix design had been chosen, the pozzolanic
reactivity test was applied to the whole set of calcined clays. Tests
were carried out in systems without and with limestone for correlation
to the relative strength results of the PPC30 and LC3-50 systems,
respectively.
3. Methods
3.1. Heat flow measurements using isothermal calorimetry
The cumulative heat of reaction was measured in an isothermal
calorimeter (TAM Air) both over 7 days at 20 °C and 40 °C. The increase
in temperature speeds up the pozzolanic reaction, but maintains the
same hydrate assemblage [14–16]. All the paste ingredients, including
the mixing solutions were stored overnight at the same temperature
as the test. About 110 g of the paste was then mixed at 1600 rpm
for 2 min and 15 g of the paste was poured into a glass ampoule, which
was closed and placed inside the calorimeter. Accompanying samples
from the same batch were cast for XRD and cured at 20 °C and 40 °C.
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the crystalline
phases formed and to follow the portlandite consumption. Measurements
were carried out on freshly cut paste slices at 1, 4 and 7 days.
The slices were mounted on a XRD sample holder and measured in
Bragg–Brentano mode using a X'Pert PANalytical diffractometer with
CuKα source operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. Samples were scanned
from 7 to 70 °2θ with a step size of 0.0167 °2θ using a X'Celerator
detector, resulting in an equivalent time per step of 30 s.
3.2. Bound water determination using oven thermal treatment
Since not all laboratories are equipped with an isothermal calorimeter,
an alternative technique based on bound water determination is
developed to assess the calcined clay reactivity. After mixing the paste
samples are cast in plastic containers and sealed at 40 °C for 1 day to reproduce
the same conditions as the tests carried out at 40 °C using isothermal
calorimetry. Then, three 4 mm-thick slices were cut for each
system using a diamond saw. The slices were dried at 110 °C in an

bound water was determined according to Eq. (3) by calculating the
mass change after heating the samples at 400 °C for 2 h and cooling
it down to 110 °C. The thermal treatment was limited to 400 °C since
higher temperatures would lead to portlandite dehydroxylation,
which is not desired in this case.

3.3. Modified Chapelle test
To compare the new test to existing method, the modified Chapelle
test was run on the different calcined clays according to NF P18-513
[17]. This test was chosen due to the fact that it is claimed to give a
quick indication of pozzolanic reactivity, within a day. For this test, 1 g
of calcined clay was mixed with 2 g of calcium oxide and 250 mL of
deionized water. Blank samples were also prepared without calcined
clay and run in parallel to the calcined clay samples. The mixwas heated
at 90 °C for 16 h.Water loss was prevented by a reflux condenser. After
cooling down to 20 °C, a solution of 60 g of sucrose in 250 mL of deionized
water was added to complex the calcium ions in solution and to
dissolve the unreacted portlandite. The suspensionwas filtered through
a Büchner filter and the liquid was titrated with a 0.1 M solution of HCl
using phenolphthalein as pH indicator. Fromthe volume of HCl solution
added, the amount of mg of bound portlandite was determined according
to Eq. (4),where V1 and V2 are the volume of HCl added for the titration
of the blank sample and the samplewith calcined clay, respectively.

4. Results
4.1. Mortar compressive strength
In Figs. 1 and 2, the compressive strengths of the PPC30 and LC3-50
mortars and their strengths relative to the unblended reference cement
are shown as a function of the calcined kaolinite content of the calcined
clays. On the graph of the strength (Fig. 1) the plain PC strengths are indicated
by dotted lines. Already, after 3 days the blend containing the
calcined clay with the very high calcined kaolinite content (95%) is
equivalent to the reference plain Portland cement. For the other ages
(7 days and later), 100% of the reference strength is obtained for blends
containing calcined clay with calcined kaolinite content of around 40%.
Strength values for PC and PPC30 and LC3-50 blends containing 38.9%
and 95% are shown in Table 5 for more precise comparison.
Moreover, strengths of both PPC30 and LC3-50 systems are linearly
correlated with the calcined kaolinite content of calcined clays. This

shows that for different clays from various areas with different compositions,
secondary phases, fineness and specific surfaces, the strength
results are almost exclusively dependent on one parameter only: the
calcined kaolinite content. Furthermore, the LC3-50 systems have
strengths close to those of the PPC30 systems in spite of their higher replacement
ratio (lower clinker content). The LC3-50 blends benefit from
the synergetic addition of calcined clay togetherwith limestone, leading
to the formation of more hydrates from the SCMs.
4.2. Optimization of parameters for R3 pozzolanic activity tests
4.2.1. Sulfate to calcined clay ratio
Fig. 3 shows the heat released per gram of solid by isothermal
calorimetry for calcined clay 1 for the four sulfate to calcined clay
mass ratios (cf. Table 4). For systems with higher sulfate content,
i.e. 0.06 and 0.08 sulfate to calcined clay ratios, an early heat flow peak
appears before 15 h of reaction. XRD patterns at 1 day of hydration
indicate that ettringite was formed in these systems. In the low sulfate
systems, no early heat flow peak was observed and XRD results did
not show the formation of ettringite. In the systems with low sulfate
content the sulfate is rapidly depleted by the calcined kaolinite pozzolanic
reaction, consuming Al to formAFmphases (mainly Hc) rather than
ettringite. The second peak in the calorimetry curves is related to C-A-SH
and AFm formation. Fig. 4 shows the cumulative heat released at
1 day, 2 days and 6 days for the different sulfate to calcined clay ratios
for the calcined clays 1 (95% of calcined kaolinite) and 4 (50.8% of calcined
kaolinite). The cumulative heat does not significantly change
with the sulfate content. The highest heat release is reached for the
system with 0.06 sulfate to calcined clay ratio.
Thus, the final sulfate to calcined clay ratio for the pozzolanic reactivity
test chosen was 0.06. This ratio was selected because 1) early
ettringite formation is a general and desirable feature of cement hydration,
and 2) the highest heat release is obtained for this ratio, indicating
that higher sulfate levels slow down the pozzolanic reaction.

clay ratio for calcined clays 1 (95%) and 4 (50.8%).

4.2.2. Alkali to calcined clay ratio
The heat released per gram of solid for the four different alkali to
calcined clay mass ratios (cf. Table 4) is shown in Fig. 5 for the calcined
clay 1. An early heat flow peak related to ettringite formation was observed
only for the two lowest alkali to calcined clay ratios, i.e. 0.06
and 0.08. This was confirmed by XRD. As expected the pozzolanic reaction
of calcined kaolinite is enhanced inmore alkaline solutions as seen
from the increasing height of the main calorimetry peak [7,18]. AFm
phases form rather than ettringite for high alkaline solutions due to
the decrease of the ion activity product for ettringite with increasing
pH [19]. The alkali U-phase is not observed because this phase only occurs
for pH higher than 14 [20].
The final alkali to calcined clay ratio was chosen at 0.08 to enable
both ettringite formation and high calcined clay reactivity.
4.2.3. Portlandite to calcined clay ratio
The effect of changing the portlandite to calcined clay ratio was investigated
using the sulfate and alkali ratios previously determined
(0.06 and 0.08, respectively). Calorimetry curves are shown in Fig. 6
for calcined clay 1. The results show that the cumulative heat release
reaches a plateau for systems having portlandite to calcined clay mass
ratios of 1/1, 1/2 and 1/3. The plateau is reached sooner and at a lower
cumulative heat release for mixes with lower portlandite contents.
The XRD patterns at 4 days demonstrate the absence of portlandite in
all mixes that reached the plateau.
The extent of reaction of the calcined clay depends on the amount of
portlandite available as reactant. As soon as portlandite is completely
consumed, a plateau is reached and overall reaction rates are reduced.
In order to assess the intrinsic reactivity of the calcined clays, it was
decided to use a 3/1 ratio for the mix design. This way the portlandite
reactant will always be in excess and the main factor controlling the
reaction kinetics is the calcined clay. The resulting optimal mix design
developed for the new pozzolanic reactivity test is presented in Table 6.
4.3. Application of the R3 test to calcined clays: heat flow measurements
4.3.1. Tests carried out at 20 °C
The heat released per gram of solid during hydration of all the calcined
clays studied is presented in Figs. 7 and 8 for systems without
and with limestone, respectively. In both cases, the calcined clay 1
with 95% of calcined kaolinite content reacts the most, whereas the
quartz system is the least reactive. These results are in agreement
with the compressive strength results. For systems without limestone,
XRD patterns clearly show the formation of monosulfoaluminate
phase for all systems at 7 days, due to the absence of calcite. An AFm
solid solution sulfate, carbonate and hydroxide together (discussed by
Pöllmann [21]) also forms as seen by the peak at 10.5 °2θ (CuKα).
Ettringite forms at earlier ages, but with the continuing dissolution of
the calcined clay, the aluminate to sulfate ratio increases, leading to
the consumption of ettringite and the formation ofmonosulfoaluminate
phase. For systemswith limestone, carboaluminates form and ettringite
remains present in the systems, as shown in Fig. 8.Moreover, the height
of the peaks of the carboaluminates increase with the calcined kaolinite
content of calcined clays.
To compare with the relative strength results from 1 to 90 days, cumulative
heat values were taken at 6 days of reaction because the reaction
significantly slows down at this age. Fig. 9 shows that good linear
correlations are obtained at all ages between the heat released and the
strengths for both PPC30 and LC3-50 systems.
4.3.2. Impact of temperature
Figs. 10 and 11 showthat increasing the temperature for the isothermal
calorimetry from20 to 40 °C accelerates the pozzolanic reaction. No
major change in phase assemblage is observed at 1 day, except for the
ettringite peaks which are lower or absent for systems with limestone.
This is likely due to the acceleration of the pozzolanic reaction of
metakaolin and the increase of ettringite solubility with temperature
[19]. The heat released after only 1 day at 40 °C is globally similar to
the heat released at 6 days at 20 °C and the heat evolution also slows
down at this time. Thus, the correlations to relative strengths are
based on the 1 day heat values. Fig. 12 shows that similar correlation coefficients
are obtained at the higher temperature.
4.3.3. Repeatability
To control the repeatability of the R3 test, three independent tests
were carried out on clay 4, with and without limestone, as shown in
Fig. 13. The standard deviations were calculated based on the heat
values at 6 days and 1 day for tests run at 20 °C and 40 °C, respectively.

Their values are shown in Table 7. The standard deviations are very
small.
4.4. Bound water determination
Fig. 14 shows that linear correlations are obtained between relative
strength and boundwater for systemswithout andwith limestone, similar
to the correlations with the heat released at 1 day. Therefore, the
bound water indicator is also a relevant method to predict the strength
development of blends. Moreover, the correlation with the heat release
values at 1 day for systemswithout andwith limestone in Fig. 15 clearly
shows the reliability of the R3 test using the boundwater determination.
4.5. Comparison with the modified Chapelle test
Fig. 16 shows the portlandite consumption for the calcined clays
ranked in order of their calcined kaolinite content. The consumption
of portlandite globally increases with the calcined kaolinite content.

Also the quartz systemshows someportlandite consumption, this is due
to the elevated temperature of the test. This pozzolanic reactivity of
quartz has already been observed for blends at 80 °C [22]. The prediction
of strengths based on themodified Chapelle test is also good, somewhat
more scatter is observed for higher calcined kaolinite contents, as
shown in Fig. 17. Finally, the comparison with the heat released at
1 day and the bound water from the R3 test in Fig. 18 shows that the
portlandite consumption is well correlated with the outputs of the R3
test. Thus, the new R3 test provides at least similarly reliable indications
of the reactivity of calcined kaolinitic clays than the modified Chapelle
test. In comparison to the modified Chapelle test which is performed
at 90 °C and without addition of alkali or sulfate the proposed R3 tests
are closer to the reaction environment in Portland cement system.
5. Conclusion
This study shows that similar compressive strengths to plain PC are
obtained for calcined clays with a calcined kaolinite content ≥40% from

7 days onwards, demonstrating the feasibility of using low-grade kaolinitic
calcined clays as cement substituent, even for LC3-50 blends containing
only 50% of clinker. The strengths of PPC30 and LC3-50 blends
linearly increase with the calcined kaolinite content of calcined clays
at all the ages from 1 to 90 days. The calcined kaolinite content parameter
is the overwhelming factor determining strength development accounting
formore than 95% of the variation from7 days onwards. Other
factors, such as the secondary phases present, fineness,method of calcination
do not account for more than 5% of the variability.
For the development of the newR3 test, the mix designwas adjusted
in order to reproduce typical conditions for cement systems. The
optimal mix design was 0.06 SO3/Calcined clay and 0.08 K2O/Calcined
clay mass ratios in order to ensure high pozzolanic reactivity.
Portlandite to calcined clay mass ratio was fixed to 3 so as not to run
out of portlandite.
The R3 test using isothermal calorimetry gives a rapid indication of
calcined clay reactivity, after 6 days for tests carried out at 20 °C and
1 day at 40 °C. Linear correlations with compressive strengths are
obtained for all ages, proving the relevance of this test. Increasing the
testing temperature to 40 °C does not affect the correlations and it is
therefore considered to be a valid way of reducing the test duration
from6 days to 1 day. Small variability ensures good reliability for this test.
The R3 test using boundwater determination after heating to 400 °C
shows very closely-related results to the heat released at 1 day. Bound
water values are linearly correlated to strength results. The bound
water determination method does not require any specific equipment

except an oven able to reach 400 °C. Despite its slightly longer experiment
time (2.5–3 days instead of 1 day for the calorimetry experiment),
this method can be applied in nearly all laboratories with basic
equipment.
Similar correlations to the existing modified Chapelle test are
obtained for the R3 test, bringing the R3 test as an alternative testing
method which is more practical and closer to reaction conditions in
real Portland cement systems.
Thus, the R3 test outputs are found to be well correlated with the
compressive strength, supporting the use of the new test as a predictive
tool for compressive strength at both the short and the long term. A parallel
testing programhas shown the potential of this rapid test for other
kinds of SCMs such as slag, natural pozzolans or fly ashes [23].
