Cognitive impairment has often been reported in scientific literature as a concern derived from chronic exposure to work-related
stress. Organizational factors can contribute to the onset of this concern especially in a susceptible population such as elderly
workers. *eaim of our study was to review the last five years of scientific literature, focusing on experimental and epidemiological
studies, possible mechanisms implicated in the onset of cognitive decline due to work-related stress, and the recent organizational
strategies to prevent detrimental effects of stress on cognitive processes. A literature search was performed in scientific platforms
Medline and Web of Science, by means of specific string search terms, restricting the search to the years of publication 2014–2019.
*irty-three articles were identified and qualitatively evaluated, reporting narratively the main point of interest. At this stage, six
articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Only a few articles considered the population of the elderly
workers, often with a short follow-up period. Strategies to manage stress with organizational procedures are scarce. Mechanisms
implicated in the development of cognitive impairment due to stress are not fully explained and seem to include a chronical
decrease in the inhibitory process of neurological pathways. Further research that focused on strategies to manage stress in elderly
workers, with the aim of preventing cognitive impairment processes, is warranted.
1. Introduction
Mental health in occupational settings is a major topic for
occupational medicine, psychology, and social science [1, 2],
with important implications for general health, psychological
well-being, and company productivity [3, 4]. Since the
decrease of classic occupational disease, due to the general
improvement of working conditions, more attention is being
paid to the mental well-being of employees. In the last five
years, a consistent number of publications have been produced
on this topic [5–8]. Modern industry 4.0 is changing
the way of working, requiring high mental performance
along with low physical effort. In fact, industry 4.0 represents
the global trend towards automation and data exchange in
manufacturing technologies. *e term industry 4.0, often
intended as a synonym of the fourth industrial revolution,
include innovative processes such as the Internet of things
(IoT), cyberphysical systems, and cognitive computing and
artificial intelligence. Modern 4.0 factories are characterized
by high connectivity between production lines and operators’
control through a system that can visualise the entire
production line and make decisions on its own.
*is high technological scenario needs extensive
adaptability of the workforce, and some population groups,
such as elderly workers, could be more vulnerable to develop
stress due to being less predisposed to change [9, 10].

*e global aging of the working population could
contribute to the problem that needs policy strategies to
support and promote an active aging of the elderly population
[11], considering also the occupational stress contribution
to poor psychological and physical health, in terms
of work-related stress, work-family conflict, shift work, and
bullying behaviors [12, 13]. Since elderly people are per se
more prone to develop a cognitive impairment due to their
age advancing [14], the other risk factors that can accelerate
this process may be prevented [15, 16]. A relationship between
work-related stress and cognitive impairment has
been recently reported in several scientific reports and literature
reviews [17, 18]. *us, there is sufficient evidence to
consider work-related stress as a factor that is able to
contribute to cognitive impairment. Since work-related
stress could lead to cognitive impairment, its impact on a
more susceptible population, such as elderly people, could be
more pronounced. *e role of occupational stress in the
development of cognitive impairment and its impact on the
elderly workforce have not been fully investigated, and the
mechanisms implicated and organizational strategies to
prevent the onset of stress and its consequences are not fully
understood.*e aim of this study was to investigate, through
a narrative literature review restricted to the last five years,
the relationship of work-related stress on cognitive impairment
in the elderly working population, along with
organizational preventive strategies and the pathophysiological
causes of the mental decline attributable to high
psychologically demanding work environments.
2. Materials and Methods
A literature review was performed in Medline and Web of
Science databases. We considered articles published in the
last five years, from 1 January 2014 to 31 March 2019. We
selected articles published in the English language, including
only studies performed with human samples. Following the
PICO strategy for scientific research (population, intervention,
comparison, and outcomes) [19], a specific string of
search was used, including the most common search term
for each PICO topic: Population, Intervention, Comparison,
and Outcome.
Inclusion criteria were as follows:
(i) Study population: working population aged over 18
years
(ii) Study design: cross-sectional studies, longitudinal
studies with a follow-up case, case-control studies,
and randomized clinical trials
(iii) Exposure: work-related stress, occupational stress,
job strain, job control, job support, and effort-reward
imbalance
(iv) Outcome: cognitive abilities measured in terms of
errors, injuries, processing speed, alertness, distraction,
memory, and testing of intellectual skills
(e.g., intelligence)
(v) Publication type: articles in scientific journals
Exclusion criteria were as follows:
(i) Study population: working population less than 18
years old and animal samples
(ii) Study design: reviews, meta-analyses, and case report
studies
(iii) Exposure: psychological stress related to caregiver
activity, physical stress, chemical exposure, biological
risk factors exposure, heat stress, and oxidative
stress
(iv) Outcome: short-term cognitive impairment and
structural changes of the brain
(v) Publication type: letters to the editor, comments,
abstracts, and book chapters
*e following search terms were combined in several
search term strings:
Population: workers, occupational group, working
population, work, job, and job task. Exposure: stress, workrelated
stress, job strain, strain, job demand, job control, job
support, effort, reward, effort-reward imbalance, organizational
factors, and work organization. Outcome: cognitive
impairment, cognitive effects, cognitive behavior, memory,
and cognitive tasks.
A total of 214 articles were identified and listed to
evaluate if they met the inclusion criteria. By means of a titleabstract
screening, articles were defined as eligible for inclusion
and then integrally read. Only articles that met the
inclusion criteria were then included after a complete
reading of the full text.
3. Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the literature search
strategy and the review process following PRISMA 2009 flow
diagram rules [20]. Twenty-seven articles that met inclusion
criteria at the title-abstract reading stage were identified and
evaluated.
A consistent number of studies about the relationship
between occupational stress and cognitive impairment in the
aging population were published. Recent research focused
not only on the onset of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease [21]
but also on those subclinical changes in mental performance
that can conduce a more important cognitive decline in
elderly people.
A clinical case-control study performed by Eskildsen
et al. [22] considered the relationship between work-related
stress and the impairment in neuropsychological test performance,
finding that self-reported stress patients had the
worst performance in prospective memory, speed, and
complex working memory, compared with controls without
work-related stress. Despite this, the cross-sectional study
design does not allow the inference about the causality of
occupational stress affecting neuropsychological performances.
Moreover, chronic cognitive impairment cannot be
evaluated with a cross-sectional study design. *e same
authors repeated the assessment of neuropsychological
performance in the same group of patients and controls after
one year [23] and found that the former patients with
prolonged work-related stress continued to perform worse
2 BioMed Research International
than controls, with a significant impairment also in memory
function. Despite the short follow-up of only one year, the
study demonstrated that prolonged work-related stress
could have a detrimental prolonged effect on cognitive
function. Another study by Eskildsen and colleagues in 2017
investigated a change in cognitive impairments in midlife
patients (mean age: 44 years) with work-related stress and
found a partial association with a change in perceived stress
and sleep disturbances over time [24].
Focusing on elderly people, two studies conducted by
Sindi et al. in 2017 [21, 25] strengthen the hypothesis of an
influence of work-related stress on cognitive performances.
*ey found a significant association between higher levels of
midlife work-related stress (mean age at the baseline of 50
years) and worse performance on global cognition and
processing speed and a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment,
dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease in later life
(mean ages at the reexamination phases of 71 and 78 years,
respectively).*e association was not seen after the extended
follow-up possibly reflecting a critical time window for the
effects of midlife stress. *e long mean follow-up period (25
years) and the adequate sample size (2000 subjects at the
initial phase) make the study a high-quality investigation.
*e importance of considering the subclinical effects of
cognitive impairment due to work-related stress has to be
considered in light of how this can impact the global
population level, resulting in worse cognitive performance.
Similar evidence was reported by Agbenyikey et al. [26],
who found that high job strain and low job control, at
midlife, in a sample of 1429 Caucasian residents (median age
at the baseline of 46 years) are associated with decline in
verbal learning and memory, with a more evident association
for the younger subgroup of participants (<65 years).
Considering that, in the European Union (EU) Member
States, the most general retirement age is 65 years [27], a
more pronounced association exactly in this age class underlines
the importance of this evidence in a population that
is still working. Consistent with Sindi et al.’s study, the onset
of cognitive impairment seems to have a window period in
the youngest old instead of the oldest old.
On the other hand, a longitudinal study performed by
Andel et al. [28] found that less job control and greater job
strain were not significantly associated with change in episodic
memory in the period leading up to retirement but
were associated with significantly poorer episodic memory
at retirement and an accelerated rate of decline in episodic
memory following retirement. A longitudinal study performed
by Sabbath and colleagues, published in 2016, deals
with the problem of cognitive impairment in older age, by
investigating which psychosocial work characteristics are
able to predict changes in a cognitive function [29] of a
sample aged more than 55 years. *ey argue, in an inconclusive
manner, that low-control jobs during working life
may be associated with impairments in cognitive function in

early old age. *ese findings are in line with the aforementioned
studies, adding new insight about how kinds of
psychological work characteristics are more prone to promote
a cognitive impairment, such as types of work characterized
by a low decision latitude. Improving job control
could be a valid strategy to slow down cognitive decline due
to the combined effect of age and work stress.
Another longitudinal study performed by Rijs and
colleagues in a population of employees aged 55–64, considering
nonemployees as the control group, found that
middle-aged workers are equally likely to experience
memory complaints as nonworking age-peers, but on the
other hand, among workers, those with cognitively demanding
work were more likely to have memory complaints
[30]. Jonsdottir and colleagues presented a case-control
follow-up, testing the differences in the cognitive assessment
of patients with stress-related exhaustion several years after
they initially sought medical care [31]. *ey found that
patients (mean age of 46 years at the baseline) still performed
significantly poorer than controls (mean age of 50 years at
the baseline) with regard to cognitive functions, suggesting a
prolonged effect of work-related stress exhaustion that has to
be taken into consideration at the moment of their return to
work. In fact, a cognitive impairment could still be present at
the resumption of the work activity, contributing to worse
job performance. However, the small sample size limited the
interpretation of results. Focusing on the postmenopausal
women, in a study conducted in women aged between 45
and 66 years, negative correlations were observed between
the majority of cognitive functions and the intensity of stress
at work and the majority of factors that caused this stress
[32].
Possible mechanisms implicated in cognitive impairment
due to work-related stress exposure have been investigated
by Landolt and colleagues [33]. Although the
study was conducted in a small population of young workers
between 16 and 24 years, the results suggest that a reduction
in vagal activity seems to have a detrimental effect on reducing
decision making and reaction time in subjects exposed
to prolonged work-related stress. A study by Marshall
and colleagues in a sample with a mean age of 68 years [34]
suggested a role of stress on affecting elderly participants’
inhibitory control in attentional and sensorimotor domains.
Results of this study are in the same direction of research
performed by Landolt and colleagues, supposing a reduction
in vagal activity and inhibitory control as a mechanism able
to affect cognitive performance, although the first was
performed in a young population (mean age: 18 years), and
the second in an elderly population (mean age: 68 years),
considering as a control group a sample of young subjects
(mean age: 21 years).
Sokka and colleagues conducted an experimental casecontrol
study in 2016 [35] in a sample of 30 participants
affected by burnout (mean age of 47 years) and observed a
decrease in working-memory related P3b responses over the
posterior scalp and an increase over frontal areas, with
respect to the control group. *ese results suggest that
burnout is associated with deficits in the cognitive control
needed to monitor and update information in working
memory. Boschi and colleagues found that a relationship
between high cognitive disorganisation and high cardiopulmonary
and anger scores as well as low perceived selfefficacy
was associated with high cognitive disorganisation,
suggesting a putative role of thinking patterns and state of
mind on visceral factors. In particular, perception of what is
stressful may lead to the body’s stress activation pathways,
which in turn may cause cognitive impairment [36]. Interactions
between social and genetic risk factors have been
investigated by Hasselgren who found a significant effect of
work control on dementia risk only for men, along with a
moderation effect of the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s
disease, that is, apolipoprotein E allele [37]. *ese
findings highlight the importance of such interactions between
social and genetic risk factors to better understand
multifactorial diseases such as dementia.
Some studies deal with the efficacy evaluation of a stressmanagement
intervention, such as an aerobic training
program or an individual cognitive behavior therapy, on
improving cognitive performance in workers exposed to
occupational stress, by means of a controlled randomized
clinical trial. While aerobic training at a moderate-vigorous
intensity within a multimodal rehabilitation program seems
to improve episodic memory in patients (mean age of 42
years) with work-related exhaustion disorder [38], the
combination of an individual cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) with a brief workplace intervention fails to demonstrate
a reduction in cognitive difficulties at any time point
during a 10-month follow-up [39]. A possible contribution
of a better work organization for the prevention of a cognitive
decline in aging workforces was suggested by a longitudinal
study performed by Riedel and colleagues [40].
*ey reported a positive association of balanced exchange
between high effort and high reward at work with improved
cognitive function over 6 years among a group of the
middle-aged population (mean age of 44 years at the
baseline), where the cognitive function was assessed by
perceptual speed and verbal fluency. Further research aimed
at clarifying the best strategies to improve cognitive performance
impairment due to work-related stress is
warranted.
In a cross-sectional study performed by Allan and colleagues
[41], high occupational stress was related to more
frequent failures of attention, memory, and concentration in
telephone nurses (mean age of 41 years), with relevant
consequences on the decision-making process. Due to the
cross-sectional study design, it is not possible to make inferences
about the direction of causality in the reported
associations. Nevertheless, it is important to underline the
possible impact of cognitive failure in job tasks with high
responsibility, such as health care workers. *ese results
suggest that burnout is associated with deficits in the cognitive
control needed to monitor and update information in
working memory. Similarly, Barbe et al. found a linkage
between perceived stress, subjective concerns about cognitive
function, and impairment of work function [42]. On the
contrary, Lees and Lal did not find any association between
stress and cognitive performance in a sample of middle-aged
nurses with a mean age of 37 years [43].
4 BioMed Research International
A case-control study conducted by Golonka and colleagues
deepened the psychobiological nature of burnout
and its effect on cognitive impairment by means of an EEG
monitoring during a specific error monitoring trial. *ey
found emerging cognitive problems in the nonclinical
burnout group with respect to the control group [44]. Once
again, the mean age of participants was 36 years old. *at
middle age class does not allow these findings to be extended
to older workers.
4. Conclusions
Our narrative review provides an update of the emerging
problem of the decline of cognitive performance in elderly
workers exposed to work-related stress. Despite the relevant
number of studies published on the topic of cognitive impairment
due to work-related stress, few studies were
conducted in an elderly population of workers that is per se
more prone to develop cognitive impairment, due to the
multifactor causality of this problem. In conclusion, the
present narrative review highlighted the importance of
taking into consideration the subclinical detrimental effect
of stress on the mental performance of workers exposed to
prolonged work-related stress, especially in those jobs that
require a high level of concentration and decision making
resources. Moreover, some gender and genetic factors seem
to play a relevant role in the complex linkage between workrelated
stress and cognitive impairment, underlying a
multifactor genesis of cognitive outcomes including organizational,
genetic, and behavioral factors. *ese findings
can be useful to target improvement strategies aimed at
enhancing the active aging of the population of the elderly
workers. Further research is warranted to enhance our
understanding of how a better organizational environment
can improve the psychological and mental health of elderly
workers.
