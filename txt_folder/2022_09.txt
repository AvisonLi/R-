Finances of the Nation
MITIGATING THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF
POPULATION AGING ON GROWTH AND PUBLIC
REVENUES—CAN THE TAX MIX HELP?
Bertrand Achou, Yann Décarie, Luc Godbout, Pierre-Carl Michaud,
Julien Navaux, and Suzie St-Cerny*
For almost 60 years, the Canadian Tax Foundation published an annual monograph, Finances
of the Nation, and its predecessor, The National Finances. In a change of format,
the 2014 Canadian Tax Journal introduced a new “Finances of the Nation” feature, which
presents annual surveys of provincial and territorial budgets and topical articles on taxation
and public expenditures in Canada.
In this article, the authors address concerns about the impact that the aging of Canada’s
population over the coming decades could have on economic growth and, consequently, growth
in government revenues. They explore how revenue-neutral changes in the tax mix today
could mitigate those concerns and raise more revenue than is projected in current forecasts
with a status-quo scenario. Using data for Quebec, the authors show that a shift in the relative
share of total revenues from personal income taxes to consumption taxes could be quite
effective over the next four decades. A revenue-neutral shift equivalent to 1 percent of the
province’s consumption tax revenues today would result in an increase in revenues ranging
between 0.3 percent and 1.0 percent by 2060, while a shift equivalent to 25 percent of consumption
tax revenues would generate additional revenues of 1.4 percent to 4.8 percent.
The underlying data for the Finances of the Nation monographs and for the articles in
this journal will be published online in the near future.

INTRODUCTION
The Canadian population is aging. For example, the share of the population aged 65
and over in Quebec is expected to increase from 20.5 percent in 2021 to 28.4 percent
in 2040.1 The population in other provinces, in particular in the Maritimes, is also
aging fast. This shift could have significant economic consequences, including a
slowdown in the growth of tax revenues.
Governments collect taxes in several ways, including through the imposition of
personal income and consumption taxes. The burden of these taxes may fall differently
across age groups. For example, personal income taxes are collected disproportionately
from working-age taxpayers, while consumption taxes are paid more uniformly across
the age distribution. Hence, the effect of population aging on public revenue may
ultimately depend on the relative weight of each tax as a share of total revenues. Intuitively,
a heavier weight for consumption taxes may mitigate the impact of population
aging on public revenue.
In an aging population with lower growth prospects, there is another argument
for revisiting the tax mix. There is a sizable literature on the effects of the tax mix on
economic outcomes. That literature focuses on differences in economic distortions
and predicts better economic outcomes from a heavier use of taxes with a less distorting
impact on economic activity. Consumption taxes are generally considered to
generate fewer behavioural distortions than personal income taxes and thus to create
less of a drag on economic growth.2 At the international level, a study by Arnold
et al.3 looked specifically at the impact of revenue-neutral changes in the tax mix on
economic growth. That study provides an empirical measure of the elasticity of
long-term gross domestic product (GDP) relative to the ratio of income taxes to
consumption taxes. Arnold et al. found that a 1 percent shift in revenue from income
taxes to consumption and property taxes would result in an increase in long-term GDP
per capita ranging between 0.25 percent and 1 percent. A recent update confirmed
the validity of these results while showing that a reduction in consumption taxes does

not in itself have a positive effect on GDP.4 In terms of Canadian evidence, several
studies have simulated the impact of adjusting the tax mix, in particular for Quebec.5
They show that lowering income taxes and increasing consumption taxes by an
equivalent amount could generate stronger economic growth and create more jobs.
Using a microsimulation approach and the elasticity calculated by Arnold et al.,
this article aims to measure the potential gains for public revenue from adjustments
to the tax mix. In particular, we consider an initial revenue-neutral tilt toward consumption
taxes and project how this would affect future revenue. We account separately
for the effect that is purely related to the age structure of the population and
for the effect of the shift in the tax mix on economic growth and, ultimately, on
public revenue.
The tax mix shift is simulated in the context of Quebec government revenues.
The focus on the provincial level is justified by recent research on the consequences
of population aging for government budgets. According to the parliamentary budget
officer (PBO)6 and Tombe,7 while the current version of the federal budget is projected
to be sustainable over the long term, the majority of provincial and territorial
budgets are projected to generate growing deficits.8
Results show that a revenue-neutral change equivalent to 25 percent of consumption
tax revenues today would result in a revenue increase ranging from 1.4 percent
to 4.8 percent by 2060. Sixteen percent of that increase is explained by changes in the
population structure, and 84 percent is due to the effects of the new tax mix on economic
growth. The cumulative revenue gains between 2020 and 2060 are expected
to be very high. Over that 40-year period, a shift from income taxes to consumption
taxes equivalent to 25 percent of the latter would generate between 0.33 and 1.3 years
of additional own-source revenue for Quebec.

METHODOLOGY
We make use of two modelling tools to construct our estimates. First, the demographic
component is modelled with the SimGen microsimulation tool.9 Aggregate
demographic assumptions are largely adjusted to those of the Institut de la statistique
du Québec10 to replicate the most recent demographic projections. Transitions at
the individual level are modelled with a set of Statistics Canada databases, including the
General Social Survey. SimGen provides a projection of the population distribution
by age, educational achievement, and household composition.
Second, the economic and public finance component is based on SimFin (v.1.0.1).11
This microsimulation model uses regressions estimated with Statistics Canada’s Social
Policy Simulation Database for the probability of employment, earnings, hours
worked, consumption expenditures, non-work income, and variables to determine
the effective tax rates paid for personal income taxes and consumption taxes. These
profiles take into account various socioeconomic characteristics, including age and
degree.
Figure 1 illustrates per capita tax revenue collected in Quebec by age group. It
considers personal income taxes and consumption taxes, which together represented
nearly three-quarters of the Quebec government’s own-source revenue in 2020
(40.9 percent for personal income taxes and 32.5 percent for consumption taxes).12
Chart a in figure 1 shows that personal income taxes paid vary much more than
consumption taxes over the life cycle. The amount of income taxes increases rapidly
until age 40-45, decreases significantly until age 55-60, and falls further thereafter.
Compared to income taxes, consumption taxes appear to be much more stable; however,
the average amount paid generally declines over the taxpayer’s lifetime. For
example, among people aged 45-59, average consumption taxes are approximately
one-half of personal income taxes. This ratio is then reduced to almost 1:1 for
65-69-year-olds, and the initial ratio is reversed at older ages.

In this equation, the aggregate value (R) of revenue (i ) at a given year (t) is the sum
for all ages (a) of per capita revenue ( r ia t ) multiplied by the population ( popa t ). Chart b
in figure 1 shows that population growth is much stronger for ages at which per
capita consumption taxes are higher than income taxes. Between 2020 and 2060, the
share of the population aged 20-69 should increase by 5 percent, while the share of
the population aged 70+ should more than double (+101 percent) over the period.
Thus, in the long term, population aging should have the effect of reducing the
growth of income taxes collected more than the growth of consumption taxes.
SCENARIOS
To estimate the potential effects of a new tax mix, Quebec’s public finances are first
projected without changing the current tax structure. This reference scenario is then
compared with two alternative scenarios.
In the first alternative scenario, consumption taxes are increased in 2020, and this
increase is offset by an equivalent reduction in personal income taxes in that year.

This scenario does not consider any impact of the new tax structure on economic
growth. Public revenues are then projected to 2060 by maintaining this initial readjustment
without modifying any other assumptions. The difference in tax revenue
compared to the reference scenario is therefore explained solely by a change in the
demographic structure.
In the second alternative scenario, the modification of the tax mix is the same as
in scenario 1 but the effect on economic growth is now integrated into the model.
The elasticity of GDP growth to fiscal changes is based on the results obtained by
Arnold et al.13 They estimate that a shift of 1 percent of total revenue from income
taxes to consumption and property taxes would increase GDP per capita in the long
run by (depending on the empirical specification) 0.25 percent (the lower bound) to
1 percent (the upper bound).14 In this scenario, the effect on GDP growth is spread
over 10 years, reaching its full impact in 2030.
For both scenarios, two levels of rebalancing intensity are simulated. The lower
level corresponds to a 1 percent increase in consumption tax revenues for 2020—that
is, $203 million (“rebalancing of 1 percent”), and the higher level corresponds to an
increase in consumption tax revenues of 25 percent for 2020—that is, $5.1 billion
(“rebalancing of 25 percent”). In all cases, personal income taxes change by an amount
equal to the increase in consumption taxes, so that the rebalancing has no effect on
government revenue in 2020.
RESULTS
Figure 2 shows the projected effects of the new tax mix on the Quebec government’s
own-source revenue over the 40-year period (2020-2060). In scenario 1, where no
effect on GDP is included, the gain from a rebalancing of 1 percent would be equal
to $2 million in 2030 (in constant 2020 dollars) and would reach $14 million in 2060.
In the case of a rebalancing of 25 percent, the gain would be equal to $53 million in
2030 and $353 million in 2060, representing an increase of 0.05 percent to 0.2 percent
in Quebec’s own-source revenue, compared to the reference scenario. These
gains are explained by the changes in population structure by age (figure 1, chart b),
13 Supra note 3.
14 In the context of this study, the impact of the new tax mix on public finances is limited to the
Quebec government’s own-source revenue. However, the elasticity measured by Arnold et al.
(supra note 3) is based on general government tax revenues. Therefore, in our study, a shift of
X percent in total revenue accounts for X percent of all the levies imposed in Quebec, whether
by the federal government, the provincial government, local authorities, or the Quebec Pension
Plan/Canada Pension Plan, so that the elasticity is calculated in relation to the total burden on
Quebec taxpayers. For the aggregates used in our study, see CFFP, supra note 12, at 24, table 4.
Furthermore, while the modification of the tax mix in Arnold et al. involves a simultaneous and
proportional increase in consumption and property taxes, only consumption taxes are increased
in our rebalancing simulations, and this could bias the results. However, if such bias exists, its
effect will be negligible given the relative weights of consumption taxes ($28,166 million) and
property taxes ($436 million) in 2020, according to the CFFP, supra note 12.

combined with the distribution of consumption and income taxes by age (figure 1,
chart a): the increase in the share of the population aged 70+ corresponds to an
increase in the share of the population for whom per capita consumption taxes paid
are higher than per capita income taxes.
Taking into account the effect on GDP growth in scenario 2 strongly increases the
effect of rebalancing on public revenue. As a reminder, the effect on GDP growth is
spread over 10 years; this explains the sharp rise observed for scenario 2 in figure 2
at the beginning of the analyzed period. In 2060, the effect of a rebalancing of
1 percent ranges from $408 million (in constant 2020 dollars) at the lower bound (an
increase of 0.3 percent in own-source revenue compared to the reference scenario)
to $1,572 million at the upper bound (an increase of 1.0 percent in own-source revenue).
The effect of a rebalancing of 25 percent ranges between $2,163 million (an

increase of 1.4 percent in own-source revenue) and $7,529 million (an increase of
4.8 percent in own-source revenue). The cumulative revenue gains between 2020
and 2060 are potentially very high: a rebalancing of 1 percent could result in a
gain ranging from 7.1 percent (at the lower bound) to 27.5 percent (at the upper
bound) of Quebec’s own-source revenue in 2060, while the gain from a rebalancing
of 25 percent could range from 35.5 percent to 129.6 percent of Quebec’s ownsource
revenue in 2060, thus representing 0.33 to 1.3 years of additional own-source
revenue.
The significant difference in the results for scenarios 1 and 2 is explained by the
fact that all the taxes collected by the Quebec government apply in scenario 2 to a
rate of growth in GDP that is accelerated because of the rebalancing. With the current
tax mix, real per capita GDP is projected to increase by 10.5 percent by 2030 (table 1).
With a rebalancing of 1 percent, the projected increase in real per capita GDP would
be 0.2 to 1.0 points higher by 2030 than the increase given the current tax mix (depending
on whether we use the lower or the upper bound estimates of Arnold et al.).
With a rebalancing of 25 percent, the increase would be 1.0 to 4.1 points higher.
In addition to the tax revenue generated by the demographic effect of the rebalancing,
we calculate the impact of higher economic growth on tax revenue. Thus,
the combined effect on revenue growth in 2060 is $2,163 million for a rebalancing
of 25 percent with the lower-bound impact on GDP, which breaks down into two
parts: $353 million (16 percent of the total effect) resulting from demographic
changes and $1,810 million (84 percent of the total effect) stemming from the effect
on per capita GDP. The effect of the rebalancing resulting from the change in the
structure of the Quebec population therefore generates only one-fifth of the additional
tax revenue projected to result from the effect of the rebalancing on GDP growth.
CONCLUSION
A revenue-neutral shift from personal income taxes to consumption taxes could
generate significant revenue for provincial and federal governments. In this article,
we have evaluated the impacts for the Quebec government. A rebalancing equivalent
to 1 percent of consumption taxes in 2020 would result in an increase in revenue of
between $408 million and $1,572 million in 2060. Such a rebalancing would generate
cumulative gains between $11.5 billion and $44.7 billion in constant 2020 value
over the 40 years of simulations. A rebalancing of 25 percent would generate gains
between $57.8 billion and $210.6 billion. At an aggregate level, the return on a
change in the tax mix is potentially large, given the difficulty of raising new revenue,
particularly in provinces with a high level of taxation, such as Quebec.
Obviously, there are a few equity issues that need to be dealt with when changing
the tax mix. Changing how we raise future taxes also changes who pays those taxes.
Some groups will pay less while others will pay more, leading to intergenerational
transfers as well as transfers within generations. For example, retirees may see their
future tax bill increase while current younger workers may see theirs decrease. However,
these intergenerational concerns are mitigated by two considerations. First, the
additional revenue raised can be targeted in ways that take into account those on
finances of the nation n 893
whom the additional burden falls. For example, future health-care services are potentially
constrained by inadequate financing that may disadvantage future retirees. A
change in the tax mix would generate new resources that could be targeted to improving
services for that group. Far from exacerbating existing intergenerational transfers
from young to older taxpayers, a change in the tax mix can reduce such transfers. But
whatever one’s views on intergenerational transfers, the change in the tax mix generates
more economic growth, the proceeds from which can be used to undo new implicit
transfers. Within generations, the change in the tax mix can also be regressive,
since personal income taxes are probably more progressive than consumption taxes.15
However, it is possible to offset most of those effects by compensating lower-income
taxpayers using various tools, including existing goods and services tax and provincial
sales tax credits.16 Overall, we think that this is a policy idea worthy of serious consideration:
a change in the tax mix can dampen the effect of population aging on
public revenue, and it is a way for both federal and provincial/territorial governments
to generate additional revenue in the long run without imposing immediate costs on
taxpayers.
