Abstract
To accurately predict the aging population in China, a novel grey predictionmodel (CFODGMW(1,1, α)model) is established
in this study. The CFODGMW(1,1, α)model has all the advantages of the weighted least squaremethod, combined fractionalorder
accumulation generation operation and grey prediction model with time power term, which makes it have excellent
prediction performance. Compared with the traditional grey prediction model based on the least square method and the
first-order accumulation operation, the CFODGMW(1,1, α) model has stronger adaptability. The proposed model and its
competing models are used to analyze the aging population in five regions of China. The results show that the prediction
performance of the CFODGMW(1,1, α) model is better than other models. Based on this, the CFODGMW(1,1, α) model is
used to predict the aging population in China in the next 4 years, and some suggestions are given based on the development
trend of the aging population.

Introduction
Population aging refers to the process inwhich the number of
the elderly (≥65 years old) keeps increasing and the proportion
of the total population keeps rising. Recently, China’s
population aging has become an arresting problem. Figure 1
shows the number and growth rate of China’s total population
and aging population (the data used for mapping comes
from China’sNational Bureau of Statistics-NBS, https://data.
stats.gov.cn/). It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the growth rate
of China’s total population is far less than that of the aging
population. In the face of the growing aging population, a
series of problems such as pension, medical care and assistance
follow. Therefore, accurate prediction of China’s aging
population is helpful for the government to formulate corresponding
policies.

Considering the exponential growth law of population
and the applicable scope of the grey prediction model (GM
model), this paper chooses the GM model to analyze and
forecast the aging population in China. The GM model is
a vital component of the grey system theory put forward
by the famous Chinese scholar Deng [1]. Due to its excellent
predictive performance, the GM model and its variants
have been widely used in various areas of society [2–7]. The
GM(1,1) model is the benchmark model of all grey variant
models. The improvement work on it has never stopped.
These improvement schemes mainly focus on the expansion
of the model, accumulative order, initial value, background
value and parameter estimation. Since the background value
and initial value are irrelevant to the focus of this article, we
will not cover the work of these two parts. The work of the
other three parts is shown as follows:
(1) Expansion of the model. To further expand the applicable
scope of the GM model, Cui et al. put forward the
NGM(1,1,k,c) model, which can simultaneously fit the
time series with homogeneous exponential law and the
time series with approximately non-homogeneous exponential
series [8]. Qian et al. proposed the GM(1,1, tα)
model with time power term and proved that GM(1,1)

Fig. 1 The number and growth rate of China’s aging population and total population from 2005 to 2019
and NGM(1,1,k) model are special expressions of this
model [9]; Inspired by Qian et al., Luo and Wei put
forward another grey model with time term, namely,
GMP(1,1,N) model [10]. Similar to GM(1,1, tα) model,
GMP(1,1,N) model can also be transformed into other
grey forecasting models by changing its parameters. Liu
et al. analyzed the modeling process and mechanism
of the GM(1,1,tα) and GMP(1,1,N) model and found
that these two models have certain defects. Based on
this, Liu et al. proposed the OPGM(1,1,α) model with
all the advantages of the two models [11]. Although
the GMP(1,1,N) and OPGM(1,1,α) model have excellent
predictive ability, their modeling mechanisms are
too complex to be universal. Therefore, the GM(1,1,tα)
model with strong adaptability is the best choice for predictive
analysis.
(2) Accumulative order. The traditional GM model is built
on the basis of the first-order cumulative generation operation
(1-AGO), which aims to reduce the randomness of
time series to achieve the purpose of accurate prediction.
However, some scholars have found that the predictive
accuracy of the GM model based on the 1-AGO is even
lower than that of theGMmodel based on initial sequence
modeling in some cases [12]. To solve this problem, Wu
proposed the idea of the fractional-order accumulative
generation operation (r-AGO) [13]. The idea of r-AGO is
to establish a programming problem based on the model,
and then use the intelligent optimization algorithms to
solve the programming problem to obtain the accumulation
order r that make themodel have theminimum error.
If the benefit brought by the accumulative operation is too
small, the order of the r-AGOis 0, that is, the original time
series is used formodeling. If the accumulative operation
can greatly enhance the predictive accuracy of the predictive
model, then the algorithms can find the best order
to build the model. Since r-AGO can stably improve the
performance of forecasting models, many grey system
models based on r-AGO have been developed [14,15].
In addition, inspired byWu [13], many other fractionalorder
accumulation operations have come into being. For
instance, inspired by the conformable fractional derivative,
Ma et al. proposed the conformable fractional grey
prediction model [16]. Subsequently, Chen et al. put forward
the grey forecastingmodel with the fractional-order
Hausdorff accumulation operation and proved the superiority
of the proposed model by cases [17]. Based on
Wu’s research [13], Liu et al. proposed the weighted
r-AGO [18] and so on.
(3) Parameter estimation. Similar to other regression prediction
models, GM models usually utilize the least square
method (LSM) to estimate the structural parameters of
the models. Indeed, the LSM is a good method because
it is easy to understand, but it is antiquated and limits
the predictive performance of the models to some
extent. To further optimize the GM models, some scholars
proposed to use other parameter estimation methods
to estimate the structural parameters of the models. These
methods include partial least square (PLS) [19], nonlinear
least square (NLS) [20,21], and the weighted least
square method (WLS) [22,23]. Among these methods,
the weighted least square method has the simplest mechanism
and powerful performance.
With the above discussion, we knowthat theGM(1,1,tα) is an
ideal model, the r-AGO and the WLS are measures that can
stably enhance the performance of the GMmodels. To accurately
predict China’s aging population, this paper establishes
an optimized GM(1,1,tα) model based on the GM(1,1,tα)
model, r-AGO and WLS. Compared with previous studies,
the contributions of this paper are as follows:
(1) We use the midpoint formula to solve the problem that
GM(1,1,tα) model is difficult to be solved.
123
Complex & Intelligent Systems (2022) 8:3463–3478 3465
(2) We propose a new combined fractional-order accumulation
operator.
(3) We use the weighted least square method with strong
compatibility to estimate the parameters of the proposed
model.
(4) This paper uses the proposed model to predict China’s
aging population in the next 4 years, and gives corresponding
suggestions based on the prediction results.
The other parts of this article are arranged as follows: the next
section gives the necessary knowledge including the definition
of the GM(1,1, tα) model and combined r-AGO. The
third section discusses the concepts, properties and solution
methods of the proposed model.The fourth section proves the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model through
five real cases. The fifth section describes the application of
the proposed model in China’s aging population. The conclusion
is given in the last section.
Prerequisite knowledge
Traditional GM(1,1,t˛)model and its optimized
discrete form
Supposing there is a time sequence X(0) = {x(0) (m) ,m =
1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, n ≥ 4, then
X(1) =

x(1) (m) =

(1)
is called the first-order accumulative generation operation
(1-AGO) sequence of X(0).
Based on the above conditions, the grey equation of the
GM(1,1,tα) model is expressed as
[x(1) (t)]
t
+ ax(1) (t) = b · tα + c. (2)
Usually, the predictive formula of GM models is the solution
of the grey differential equation. Obviously there is no
exact solution for Eq. (1). When Qian et al. put forward
the model, they did not provide a solving method for the
model, but only used α = 2 to establish the model for prediction,
which greatly restricted the predictive ability of the
GM(1,1,tα) model. In the past, people usually used the forward
difference formula [22] or the backward difference
formula [24] to approximate the derivative to discretize the
differential equation similar to Eq. (1). However, these two
methods are not the best methods. According to the difference
quotient method shown in Fig. 2, we can see that the
accuracy of the midpoint formula is much higher than that of
the forward difference formula and the backward difference
formula. Next, we estimate the errors of the three difference
quotient formulas. Performing Taylor expansion of f (a+h)
at point a to get
f (a + h) = f (a) + h f 
(a) + h2
2
f 
(ζ ), ζ ∈ [a, a + h].
(3)
Substituting the above equation into the forward difference
formula f 
(a) = f (a+h)− f (a)
h
+ ε, we can get
f 
(a) =
f (a) + h f 
(a) + h2
2 f 
(ζ ) − f (a)
h

= f 
(a) + h
2
f 
(ζ ) + ε, (4)
that is
ε = −h
2
f 
(ζ ). (5)
Therefore, the truncation error of the forward difference
formula is O(h). Similarly, we can know that the truncation
errors of the backward difference formula and the midpoint
formula are O(h) and O(h2). Obviously, the midpoint formula
has the least error. Therefore, we use the midpoint
formula to discretize Eq. (2), and then we can get
x(1) (t + 1) − x(1) (t − 1) = −2ax(1) (t) + 2btα + 2c. (6)
Let μ1 = −2a,μ2 = 2b,μ3 = 2c, and then Eq. (6) can
be expressed by
x(1) (t + 1) = x(1) (t − 1) + μ1x(1) (t) + μ2tα + μ3. (7)
Equation (7) is called the optimized discrete GM(1,1,tα)
model (ODGM(1,1,tα)model). Similar to the regression prediction
model, the parameters μ1,μ2,μ3 of the ODGM(1,1,
tα) model are estimated by using the LSM, that is,

Since the ODGM(1,1, tα) model is built using the 1-AGO, it
is necessary to carry out the 1-order inverse AGO (1-IAGO)
on Eq. (9) to obtain the predicted values, that is,
x

(t) = x (1)

According to the introduction of the ODGM(1,1,tα)
model, we can still find some deficiencies.
(1) The ODGM(1,1,tα) model is built based on the 1-AGO.
Although a sequence with weakened randomness can be
obtained by 1-AGO, this does not mean that the prediction
performance of the model is improved.
(2) Similar to the traditional regression model, the ODGM(1,
1,tα) model uses the LSM to solve the structural parameters
of the model. Indeed, the LSM is a good method,
but it is too simple and limits the predictive performance
of the model to some extent.
These two points provide ideas for the optimization scheme
of this article. This article will discuss the optimization
measures of the ODGM(1,1,tα) model in detail in the next
section.
The combined fractional-order accumulative
generation operation
The advantage of fractional-order accumulation generation
operation (r-AGO) is that it can choose the most suitable
order to build the model through algorithms. Compared
with the traditional 1-AGO, it is more adaptable. Obviously,
the r-AGO can solve the first deficiency described
in the previous section. At present, there are two popular
r-AGOs, namely the r-AGO proposed by Wu [13] and the
fractional-order Hausdorff accumulation generation operation
(δ-HAGO) proposed by Chen et al. [17]. To further
enhance the predictive ability of themodel,we combine these
two measures and propose a new r-AGO, which is defined as
follows.

completes the proof. 

In this paper, Eq. (12) is used to generate accumulative
sequence, while Eq. (36) is used to restore output sequence.
The proposedmodel
Based on the knowledge in Section “Prerequisite knowledge”.
this section will give the definition of the
CFODGMW(1,1,α) model.
For a given original time series X(0), if it satisfies Theorems
1 and 2, then the following equation:
h(r ) (k + 1) = h(r ) (k − 1)+μ1 · h(r ) (k)+μ2 · kα +μ3
(37)
is called the combined fractional ODGM(1,1,α) based on
weighted least square (WLS)(abbreviated asCFODGMW(1,
1,α)), whereμ1 is the development modulus, andμ2 ·kα+μ3
is grey action.
Parameters’ estimation of the CFODGMW(1,1,˛)
model
Let k = 2, 3, . . . , n in Eq. (37), and we get the following
system:
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
h(r ) (3) − h(r ) (1) = μ1 · h(r ) (2) + μ2 · 2α + μ3
h(r ) (4) − h(r ) (2) = μ1 · h(r ) (3) + μ2 · 3α + μ3
...
h(r ) (n) − h(r ) (n − 2) = μ1 · h(r ) (n − 1) + μ2 · (n − 1)α + μ3
(38)
and its matrix form is
Xψ = ϒ, (39)

where
ϒ =

.
According to linear algebra knowledge, there is no
exact solution to Eq. (39). Let the residual vector is τ =
[ε(2), · · · , ε(n)]T , and we have
τ = ϒ − Xψ.
Then, the estimated value of the parameter set ψ is

Properties of the CFODGMW(1,1,˛) model

CFODGMW(1,1,α) model takes different values, we have
the following conclusions.

(3) When δ = 1, r = 0, α = 0,W = I , the CFODGMW(1,
1,α) model degenerates to the DGM(1,1) model [24]
based on midpoint difference.
(4) When δ = 1, r = 0, α = 1,W = I , the CFODGMW(1,
1,α) model degenerates to the NDGM(1,1,k) model [26]
based on midpoint difference.
Unbiasedness
Unbiasedness means that the forecasting model can completely
fit a time series. Since the modeling mechanism of
the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is too complex, it is very difficult
to directly prove the unbiasedness of the model using
the formula. Therefore, we use examples to prove that the
model is unbiased.
Theorem 3 The CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is unbiased for
time series satisfying the homogeneous or non-homogeneous
laws.
Proof Case 1: When δ = 1, r = 0, α = 0,W = I, Eq. (37)
(CFODGMW(1,1,α)) is transformed into
x(1) (k + 1) = x(1) (k − 1) + μ1x(1) (k) + μ2. (48)
Obviously, Eq. (48) is the expression of the DGM(1,1)
model based on midpoint difference. When the time series
satisfies the homogeneous law, that is,XFit + XPre = {2 ·
3k , k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}+{2·3k , k = 6, 7}. The XFit is applied to
establish the model, and XPre is applied to test the predictive
ability of the model.
According to Eq. (41), we can get
ψ
= [
μ1,
μ
2]T
= [2.666666666666667, 7.999999999999950]T .
Then, we bring 
μ1,
μ
2 into Eq. (48), and then according
to the 1-IAGO, we can obtain
x
(0)
(k) = 2 · 3k = x(0) (k) , k = 1, 2, · · · , 7. (49)
Case 2: When δ = 1, r = 0, α = 1,W = I, Eq. (37) is
turned into
x(1) (k + 1) = x(1) (k − 1)+μ1 · x(1) (k)+μ2 ·kα+μ3.
(50)
Then, Eq. (50) is the expression of the NDGM(1,1,k)
model. When the time series satisfies the non-homogeneous
law, that is, XFit + XPre = {2 · 3k +2, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}+{2 ·
3k +2, k = 6, 7}. The XFit is applied to establish the model,
and XPre is applied to test the predictive ability of the model.
According to Eq. (41), we can get
ψ
= [
μ1,
μ
2,
μ
3]T = [2.666666666666660,
−5.33333333333168, 11.999999999998451]T . (51)
Then, we bring μ1,
μ
2,
μ
3 into Eq. (50), and then according
to the 1-IAGO, we can obtain
x
(0)
(k) = 2 · 3k + 2 = x(0) (k) , k = 1, 2, · · · , 7. (52)
Therefore, this complete the proof. 
Note that since there are many time series that conform
to the homogeneous exponential law or approximate
non-homogeneous exponential law in real life, the
CFODGMW(1,1,α) model has a wide application background.
The solutionmethod of the CFODGMW(1,1,˛) model
From the expression of the CFODGMW(1,1,α)model, it can
be seen that the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is built on the
basis of the r,α,δ. Then, the most important task is to determine
the r, α, δ of the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model. To solve
the parameters r, α, δ, we consider establishing a programming
model with errorminimization as the objective function

Obviously, the traditional method is difficult to solve the
above-mentioned planning problem. Here, we use the whale
optimization algorithm (WOA) [27] to solve the above planning
problem to obtain the parameters r, α, δ that make the
model have the smallest error. The calculation process of the
CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is shown in Fig. 3.
Validity
In this section, the aging population of five regions in China
is taken as cases to verify the validity of the proposed model.
The five data sets are from the statistical yearbook for each
region, as shown in Table 1. The models used for comparison
include exponential curve model (ECM), GM(1,1)
model [1], polynomial regression model (PR) [28],FGM(1,1)
model [29],OGM(1,1) model [30] and GMP(1,1,N) model
with excellent predictive performance [10]. The aging population
from 2010 to 2016 are applied to build models, and
the last three data are applied to test the predictive ability of
the models. The MAPEs of the seven predictive models are
shown in Table 2. In addition, to facilitate readers to observe
the gap between the models, we visualized the data in Table
2, as shown in Fig. 4.
It can be seen from Fig. 4 that in the fitting stage, the
CFODGMW(1,1,α)model has a winning rate of 60%, which
is much higher than that of other models. Therefore, the fitting
performance of CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is better than that
of its competitors. According to Fig. 4 (right) we can clearly
see that the winning rate of the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model
is 100%, which means that the prediction performance of
the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is the best among all models.
Therefore, the validity of the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is
confirmed.

Fig. 5 The curves, APE (%) and MAPE (%) of the seven models in the case of China’s aging population
ing the training phase, which means that these two models
are also tools with excellent fitting performance. Although
the GMP(1,1,N) model and FGM(1,1) model have better
fitting performance than CFODGMW(1,1,α) model, we
can see that there is little difference in their fitting performance.
It is worth noting that the pink bar representing the
CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is the lowest in the test phase,
meaning that its predictive performance is better than the
other models. From the first figure shown in Fig. 5, we can
see that the curve of CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is very close
to the curve of the real value, which indicates that the development
trend of CFODGMW(1,1,α) model conforms to the
actual situation. The APE in Fig. 5 also implies that the performance
of the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is better than
other models. In summary, compared with other models,
the CFODGMW(1,1,α)model is more suitable for analyzing
China’s aging population. Beside, the running time ofWOA
in this case is shown in Table 6.
Forecasts and suggestions
Since the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model has won the competition
with other models, this section will use it to forecast
China’s aging population from 2020 to 2023 and give some
corresponding policy recommendations according to the predicted
results. Inspired by the idea of metabolism [32], based
on the parameters r, δ and α of the CFODGMW(1,1,α)
model described in Section “Numerical results”, the original
data from 2008 to 2019 are used to establish the
CFODGMW(1,1,α) model to predict China’s aging population
from 2020 to 2023. The number of the aging population
in the past 4 years is shown in Fig. 6.
According to the data shown in Fig. 6, it can be seen that
the aging population in China will further increase in the
next few years, which is bound to have a huge impact on the
development of Chinese society.
On the one hand, the sustained growth of the aging population
and the declining birth rate indicates that China will
completely become an “aging country”. The main reason
for this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that young
people in China are under great pressure in life, and their
salary cannot support them to raise a newborn. In addition,
the early “family planning” in China also contributed to this
phenomenon. Based on this, this article gives two related
suggestions
1. To curb the surge in housing prices, the biggest living
pressure of Chinese young people comes from the continuous
increase in housing prices. Lower housing prices
will inevitably lead to social unrest in China, but the Chinese
government can control housing prices to stabilize,
which can reduce the pressure on the younger generation.
2. Promoting the birth subsidy program. China should
encourage young people to have children, and provide
certain financial assistance to parents with multiple newborns.
On the other hand, with the increase in the aging population,
their huge medical expenditure directly promotes the
increase in the total dependency ratio of the society, thereby
reducing the growth rate of GDP, which has a certain hindering
effect on the economic development of Chinese society.
Given this situation, the Chinese government should speed
up the coverage of insurance business, expand the applicable
scope of the insurance business, so that more aging population
can enjoy the benefits of insurance business.
Conclusion
Considering the exponential growth law of population and
the applicable scope of the grey forecastingmodel, this paper
proposes an optimized discrete grey forecastingmodel based
on the WLS and combined fractional-order accumulation
operation. By analyzing themodelingmechanism of the proposed
model, it is found that the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model
123
3476 Complex & Intelligent Systems (2022) 8:3463–3478
Fig. 6 The growth rate and number of China’s aging population in the next 4 years
can be transformed into other types ofGMmodels by changing
its structural parameters, and it is unbiased for the time
series satisfying homogeneous or non-homogeneous laws.
These two aspects prove that CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is
a kind of prediction model with excellent predictive performance.
Subsequently, the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model and its
comparative models are used to study China’s aging population.
Numerical results show that the prediction performance
of the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is better than other predictionmodels.
At the end of the article, the CFODGMW(1,1,α)
model is used to forecast the aging population in China in
the next 4 years, and some corresponding recommendations
are given according to the forecast results.
In addition, although the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is a
forecasting model with excellent predictive performance, it
still has some defects. According to its modeling steps, we
can see that the information of the first data in the time series
is ignored when the CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is built, and
the information is hard-won and it is a shame towaste it. How
to make full use of the first data to build a more reasonable
CFODGMW(1,1,α) model is still a problem.
