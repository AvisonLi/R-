Population Aging — China, 2015–2050
Yanan Luo1,2; Binbin Su2,4; Xiaoying Zheng2,3,4,#
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
As the largest country in the world, China experienced
a demographic transition at a historic scale during the
past 50 years with extraordinarily associated changes in
the age structure of the population, declining fertility
rates, accelerating process of population aging, and
growing population scale.
What is added by this report?
This study presented future trends of five important
population indicators in China. From 2015–2050,
China experienced outstanding demographic changes
— increases in life expectancy and declines in fertility
rate — that have led to population aging. In addition,
disability prevalence is growing, and life expectancy
with disability is also increasing.
What are the implications for public health
practice?
This study provided evidence of healthy life expectancy
improvement and disease burden declining, healthy
aging, and active aging. Due to the uncertainties of
future trends of population structure changes, dynamic
evaluations, timely adjustments, and innovations in
population health strategy design and management
should be strengthened to ensure quality of life under
the background of population aging.
China experienced significant changes in the age
structure of the population, declining fertility rates,
and accelerating population aging (1) and has made
considerable strides in raising its life expectancy.
However, the double burden of population aging and
an increasing chronic disease burden has led to the
continuous growth of the disability burden in China
(2). An increasing pace of aging and fluctuated
population trends in China poses serious challenges for
population health, which makes predicting future
trends increasingly important. By using the Sample
Census in 2015 and secondhand data in China, this
study used the Population-Development-Environment
(PDE) model and used the Sullivan method to present
the future trends of scale, structure of population, life
expectancy, disability, and disability-free life
expectancy. This study presented predictions of five
important indicators of population trends from
2015–2050 in China, which showed China
experiencing major demographic and health changes.
Elderly population health promotion and disability
prevention measures should be implemented to
eliminate adverse health effects influenced by
population aging.
This study used data from the 2015 Sample Census
and previous publications (3–4) to predict future
population trends. The 2015 Sample Census was
conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics, which
provided detailed data on the population scale and
structure of China, covering 31 provincial-level
administrative divisions (PLADs) in China. Disabilityrelated
data was mainly calculated based on the First
and Second National Sample Surveys on Disability,
which were nationally representative population-based
surveys conducted in 1987 and 2006, respectively,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO)
International Classification of Functioning, Disability,
and Health. The PDE model, epidemiological
calculations, and Sullivan method were used to predict
population trends and healthy life expectancy from
2015–2050, respectively. The mathematical
expressions for PDE were as follows:

Where t, n, P, PT, D, and N represent the age, year,

the number of women, the fertility rate for specific age
groups, and the total proportion of women with

newborns, respectively. PT and m represent the total
population and the highest age of the population,
respectively. The principles underlying the PDE model
can be found in Supplementary Figure S1 available in
http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/.
Based on the assumptions of three scenarios, the
predictive parameters of the PDE model include total
fertility rate (TFR) and mortality rate (MR). The TFR
parameters from 2015–2017 of Scenarios 1 and 2 were
set according to the survey findings from National
Fertility Intention Survey. Scenario 1 assumes that
TFR declines from 2017 and reaches 1.60 in
2018–2020 and will increase to 1.70 from 2021–2050
due to the Three-Child Policy based on expert’s
judgement. Scenario 2 assumes that TFR will decline
to 1.60 from 2026–2050 with the fading effects of the
three-child policy. Scenario 3 assumed that birth
patterns across the mainland of China were similar to
those in Taiwan, China in 2000, because the TFR of
the mainland of China in 2015 was similar to that of
Taiwan, China in 2000. More details can be found in
Supplementary Table S1 available in http://weekly.
chinacdc.cn/. Mortality rate was calculated according
to assumptions from a previous study (5). According to
the Outline of Healthy China 2030 Plan, life
expectancy in 2020 was assumed to be 77 years and 80
years in 2030. By 2050, life expectancy was projected
to reach 85 years according to China’s General
Program for Sustainable Development. Furthermore,
we assumed that the prevalence of disability to be
increasing at the same rate as from 1987–2006. The
scale of disability was calculated according to the
prediction of population scale and the assumption of
disability prevalence. Disability-free life expectancy was
calculated through the Sullivan method.
Findings from the PDE model showed that the total
population would reach 1.40–1.44 billion by 2030 and
1.29–1.40 billion by 2050 (Figure 1). Our findings
indicated that in 2030, about 70% of the total
population would live in cities, and this percentage
would reach over 81% in 2050.
In the future, China is expected to face rapid
population aging even after considering the effects of
two-child and three-child policies on population.
According to the moderate prediction, China was
projected to become an aged society by 2022 and a
super-aged society by 2033. This 11 year
transformation sees the population aged 65 years or
older (henceforth referred to as the elderly) comprise
14% of the total population to 20% by 2033
(Figure 2). From the Fifth Population Census to the
Seventh Population Census, the proportion of elderly
was continuously increasing from 6.96% in 2000 to
8.87% in 2010, and 13.50% in 2020. Overall, 30 of
31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) in
the mainland of China in 2020 entered the “aging
society phase” with the proportion of elderly making
up over 7% of the population, and 12 PLADs entering
the “aged society phase” with the proportion of elderly
over 14%. Only Tibet Autonomous Region did not
enter the “aging society” phase, which may be due to
its low life expectancy (Table 1, Figure 3).

108.67–108.79 million persons with disability were
estimated in China in 2020. By 2030, this number was
projected to increase to 136.24–136.74 million
(Figure 4). Along with population aging, the challenge
of disabled population aging has become an
increasingly prominent issue in China. In 1987,
disability in China had a balanced distribution of age,
but this shifted towards people of older ages in 2006.
The number of elderly people with disability reached
52.71 million in 2020, and the proportion of disabled
elderly was projected to account for over 57% of total
disabled persons by 2030 and would further increase to
over 70% by 2050 if no prevention and control
measures are implemented.
According to our prediction, life expectancy of males
and females is expected to continue increasing. For
males, life expectancy increased from 73.9 years in
2015 to 74.9 years in 2020, to 77.2 years in 2030 and
81.85 years in 2050. For females, life expectancy was
projected to increase from 79.9 years in 2015 to 80.65
years in 2020, to 83.14 years in 2030 and 88.13 years
in 2050 (Figure 5).
Figure 6 showed that disability-free life expectancy
at birth (both sexes combined) was forecasted to
increase from 69.53 years in 2015 to 72.87 years in
2030 and over 78.26 in 2050. However, the
percentage of life expectancy with disability will keep
growing: from 9.60% in 2015 to 11.22% in 2030 and

14.54% in 2050. Older adults were estimated to
experience 5.78 years lived with disability in 2015, and
this number is expected to increase to 7.44 years in
2030 and to 11.45 in 2050.
DISCUSSION
This study estimated future trends of 5 important
population indicators from 2015–2050 in China.
Since the 21st century, China experienced significant
demographic changes — increases in life expectancy
and declines in fertility rate — that have led to
population aging. Along with population aging, the age
structure of the population living with disability shifted
towards people of older ages living with disability, and
the life expectancy with disability also continuously
increased.
Although the general trend of fertility rate was
projected to decline, China still has a large population.
As the most populous nation in the world, China also
has the largest older population. With the fading of the
effects of the two-child policy and the influence of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), China entered
a phase with the lowest low-fertility rates in history
according to the results of the Seventh Census. The
two-child policy had delayed the arrival of an aging
society brought forth by the one-child policy, but its
effect are slowing down. The sheer size of the elderly
population and rapidity of aging drives the
implementation of the policy of actively dealing with
the challenge of aging. Providing support policies for
women of childbearing age to achieve their fertility
goals and postponing the retirement age may have
immediate effects on population aging. Moreover,
regional differences were found in the progress of
population aging. Furthermore, unbalanced
socioeconomic and technological developments may
one of the important contributions to this difference

(6–7). Due to the uncertainties of future trends in
population structural changes, dynamic evaluation,
timely adjustment, and innovations in population
health strategy design and management should be
strengthened to ensure the quality of life for the
population in the future.
The results showed that the life expectancy of the
Chinese people would continuously increase, but life
expectancy with disability would also keep increasing.
Older adults with disabilities are among the most
severely affected, as their age coupled with disabilities
would impede their full and equal participation in all
aspects of life. Therefore, understanding trends and
estimations in the prevalence of disabilities is key to
assessing the implications of aging for population
health (8). The findings from the disability forecast
were important scientific and political references to
healthy life expectancy improvement and disease
burden declining, healthy aging, and active aging.
This study was subject to some limitations. Because
of restrictions associated with the Seventh Census and
other demographic materials, the findings should be
interpreted with caution. Although three hypothetical
scenarios were set up, an inevitable bias between the
predicted results and the real results existed. For
example, fertility policy may change in the future, and
the TFR might be not in the range of our assumptions.
More studies should be taken to fix these issues in the
future.
In conclusion, this study predicts population trends
and associated health indicators influenced by
population aging in China. The uncertainties in
population structure and health will lead to challenges
in political strategies and management of population.
Future health action plans should consider the
uncertainties of multiple scenarios in the future and
promptly adjust health strategies to reflect innovations
and real health impacts caused by aging and disability.
