Abstract
The balsam twig aphid Mindarus abietinus Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the spruce spider mite Oligonychus
ununguis (Jacobi) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and the pine needle scale Chionaspis pinifoliae (Fitch) (Hemiptera:
Diaspididae) are three important pests for the Christmas tree industry of Québec, Canada. Temperaturedependent
development rates for postdiapause overwintering eggs of these species have never been studied
for populations of southern Québec, where the vast majority of Christmas trees are grown. The accumulation of
physiological time in growing degree days (GDD) is a standard tool to predict egg eclosion dates for pests, when
first generation immatures are most vulnerable to insecticidal control. Development rates for postdiapause eggs
were tested at four or five constant temperatures in the 11–23°C range under controlled conditions, based on
time before hatching for eggs collected in a balsam fir plantation in late winter. The standard linear model and
three published nonlinear models were fitted to the data and compared for their ability to estimate key biological
temperature parameters and to predict development rates of postdiapause eggs. Validation of model predictions
of egg eclosion time on balsam fir in the field was reasonably accurate using the classical linear model where
field-accumulated GDD were calculated with a particular interpretation of the average method based on daily
maximum and minimum temperatures. The linear model could predict mean egg eclosion within around 5 d of
eclosion dates observed in the field.

Le puceron des pousses du sapin Mindarus abietinus Koch (Hemiptera : Aphididae), le tétranyque de l’épinette
Oligonychus ununguis (Jacobi) (Acari : Tetranychidae) et la cochenille des aiguilles du pin Chionaspis pinifoliae
(Fitch) (Hemiptera : Diaspididae) sont d’importants ravageurs des arbres de Noël au Québec. Le développement des
oeufs hivernants postdiapausants, en fonction de la température, n’a jamais été étudié pour les populations du sud
du Québec, où cette culture est concentrée. L’accumulation du temps physiologique en degrés-jours de croissance
(DJ) est un outil essentiel pour prédire la date d’éclosion des oeufs de ravageurs, alors que les immatures de
première génération sont vulnérables aux traitements insecticides. Le taux de développement des oeufs hivernants
a été mesuré en conditions contrôlées pour quatre ou cinq températures constantes dans la gamme 11–23°C,
calculé selon le temps de développement jusqu’à l’éclosion d’oeufs collectés sur le sapin baumier. Le modèle
linéaire standard et trois modèles non linéaires publiés ont été évalués pour leur capacité à prédire les paramètres
biologiques de réponse à la température et le taux de développement. La prédiction de l’éclosion des oeufs sur le
terrain a été validée avec le calcul du temps physiologique accumulé en DJ avec une interprétation particulière de la
méthode des moyennes basée sur les températures quotidiennes maximales et minimales, en association avec le
modèle linéaire. Cela a permis de prédire l’éclosion printanière sur le terrain à environ cinq jours près.

Introduction
Temperature-dependent development in insects and mites is an
important physiological trait that can strongly influence population
dynamics, therefore it is often studied for pest management purposes
(Roy et al. 2002, Trudgill et al. 2005, Sandhu et al. 2010, Moore and
Remais 2014). Apart from rare exceptions (Heinrich 1974), poikilothermic
life processes respond to daily temperature fluctuations and,
on a larger time scale, to seasonal trends in temperature (Speight et al.
2008). When testing the effects of temperature on arthropod development,
models can be used to describe this relation and predict pest
activity. In turn, reasonably accurate models can help reduce the use
of pesticides and the costs of treatments. For these reasons, this study
focuses on three conifer arthropods notably considered as pests in
commercial Christmas tree plantations of southern Québec, Canada.
The rate of development Rdev for poikilotherms, simply estimated
as the reciprocal of time (e.g., hours or days) taken to reach maturity
or to complete specific life stages (Roy et al. 2002), varies systematically
according to temperatures above freezing and below the tolerable
maximum (Speight et al. 2008, Moore and Remais 2014). This
relation has been variously described mathematically first with the
classical linear model (Ikemoto and Takai 2000, Trudgill et al. 2005)
and also with several nonlinear models (e.g., Table 1 in Zahiri et al.
2010). With nonlinear models, the thermal dependence of development
rates is characterized by three theoretical biological temperature
parameters: the low and high temperature thresholds (Tmin and
Tmax), and the optimal temperature (Topt). In this three-parameter
mathematical representation, the Rdev is nil at Tmin, increases in a
quasilinear fashion between Tmin and Topt where, rather than increasing
further linearly, it is maximal and plummets rapidly to become
nil again at Tmax (Brière et al. 1999, Trudgill et al. 2005, Paaijmans
et al. 2013).
For Christmas tree growers targeting timely control of pests
during their most vulnerable development stages, thermal requirements
are most easily approximated using physiological time or time
needed to develop at temperatures above threshold, expressed as
growing degree days (GDD), which is derived from the linear model.
This time is assumed to be fixed for a given life stage and is thus
often reported as a ‘thermal constant’ (K), directly obtained using
the reciprocal of the slope from the linear model (Ikemoto and Takai
2000, Trudgill et al. 2005). The linear model can provide an accurate
prediction of emergence for a target pest stage if field temperatures
generally fall within the intermediate viable range below Topt,
where development rate is linearly related to temperature or nearly
so (Bergant and Trdan 2006). The most commonly used method to
calculate the amount of GDD accumulated daily is based on the difference
between the mean temperature, calculated from the maximum
and minimum, and the development threshold (McMaster
and Wilhelm 1997). In practice, the linear model-based prediction
for the occurrence of a final step (e.g., egg eclosion) is based simply
on cumulative daily GDD to reach the specific thermal constant of
the development stage of interest. Thus, for linear modeling in pest
monitoring, Tmin and K are needed along with temperatures that generally
represent those experienced by arthropods in the field, in order
to predict when a pest completes a given life stage.
From the many nonlinear models available, some are more commonly
used than others to model temperature-dependent development
rates in poikilotherms (Roy et al. 2002). Although they do not
estimate a thermal constant like the linear model, they could also
be used in modeling and provide three critical temperature parameters
(i.e., Tmin, Topt, and Tmax), which are useful for quantifying the
thermal limits of the organism at a particular stage. The Hilbert
and Logan, Lactin-2, and Kontodimas-16 models tested here can
estimate all three parameters mentioned above (Hilbert and Logan
1983, Lactin et al. 1995, Kontodimas et al. 2004). These nonlinear
models account for the curvilinear nature of development rates for
the whole range of temperatures, including limiting ones near the
thresholds for the studied species.
In commercial Christmas tree plantations, the balsam twig aphid
Mindarus abietinus Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is an important
pest of balsam fir Abies balsamea (L.) Miller (Pinaceae) and Fraser
fir Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poiret (Pinaceae) (Nettleton and Hain 1982,
Bradbury and Osgood 1986, Fondren and McCullough 2003). Its
life cycle is complex and begins in the spring with the asexual fundatrix,
or stem mother, which emerges from an overwintering egg in
early May in southern Québec (Deland et al. 1998, Doherty et al.
2017). When fir buds break open, developing aphids of this first generation,
which up to bud break had fed on shoots of the previous
year, migrate onto the young current-year shoots to feed, where they
mature and viviparously produce the second generation of aphids,
thus forming a colony (Varty 1968). The growing colony stunts the
growth of shoots and deforms their needles, thus creating a pseudogall,
which protects the aphid colony, but reduces the aesthetic
value of commercial Christmas trees, especially during the last 2 yr
before tree harvest (Nettleton and Hain 1982). Therefore, insecticidal
treatments against M. abietinus should be most effective before
the migration of the immature stem mothers onto the newly expanding
shoots, when they are most exposed (Kleintjes 1997). Estimates
of M. abietinus for Tmin and K for egg eclosion are available for
New Brunswick, Canada and southern Québec (Varty 1968, Deland
et al. 1998), but are based primarily on field observations (Table 1),
instead of determination under controlled conditions at experimentally
fixed temperatures, as usually indicated (Brière et al. 1999, Roy
et al. 2002, Trudgill et al. 2005).
The spruce spider mite Oligonychus ununguis (Jacobi) (Acari:
Tetranychidae) is also considered a pest in commercial Christmas
tree plantations, especially on Fraser fir (Boyne and Hain 1983,
Table 1. Previous estimates of physiological time required for egg eclosion of three arthropod species overwintering as diapause eggs on

Richmond and Shetlar 1996, Cloutier et al. 2009). In southern
Québec, its life cycle typically begins in mid-May when first-generation
mites emerge from overwintering eggs (Cloutier et al. 2009).
The larvae and nymphs feed by sucking out the cellular contents
of fir needles, which causes the yellowing and bronzing of foliage
(Kielczewski 1966). During severe infestations of O. ununguis on
fir, needle abscission, reduction in shoot growth, and even premature
death of the host tree can occur (Löytteniemi 1971, Johnson
and Lyon 1991). Relatively warm and dry conditions increase the
fecundity of females, and four to five generations may be observed
from late spring to early fall in southern Québec (Boyne and Hain
1983, Cloutier et al. 2009). As for the balsam twig aphid, the
period for optimal control of O. ununguis rests just after the larvae
of the first generation have emerged from the overwintering
eggs. A thermal constant for overwintering egg hatching is available
for populations of O. ununguis in Ohio (Table 1) (Richmond
and Shetlar 1996).
As for the pine needle scale Chionaspis pinifoliae (Fitch)
(Hemiptera: Diaspididae), its presence is commonly reported not
only on both balsam and Fraser firs in commercial Christmas tree
plantations but also on other ornamental pine and spruce conifer
species (Miller et al. 2005). In Québec, C. pinifoliae has the status of
an emerging pest of Christmas trees and is not known to cause any
significant damage. Although not generally monitored by growers,
it can be an obstacle for exportation. In Canada, it is a univoltine
species, whereas in the United States, a second generation has been
observed (Cumming 1953, Nielsen and Johnson 1973). Both sexual
and parthenogenetic forms have been documented (Stimmann 1969,
Luck and Dahlsten 1974). Typically, the hatching of overwintering
eggs occurs around mid-June, after which the mobile crawlers settle
rapidly on the needles to pursue development and secrete their protective
scale (Cumming 1953, Martel and Sharma 1968), thus limiting
the time window when these insects are exposed and vulnerable
to insecticide treatments. GDD models and thermal response data
exist for the pine needle scale (Table 1), but are based on populations
in Iowa and Michigan, USA (Burden and Hart 1989, Fondren and
McCullough 2005).
The objective of this study was to test the effect of temperature
on postdiapause egg development rates for populations of M. abietinus,
O. ununguis, and C. pinifoliae in southern Québec. Also, we
aimed to develop practical models to estimate thermal requirements
(i.e., physiological time) for egg eclosion and associated temperature
parameters (Tmin, Topt, Tmax, and K) for all three species. We hypothesize
that the available thermal constants previously estimated
for these arthropod pests are not representative of the populations
found in southern Québec. Optimizing development models for local
populations of these species could provide a better understanding of
the effects of climate on spring hatching and facilitate their control,
thus maximizing the efficacy of pesticide treatments and reducing
their frequency in commercial Christmas tree plantations.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Experimental Arenas
Eggs from M. abietinus and O. ununguis were collected on balsam
fir shoots in a commercial Christmas tree plantation (45.905°N,
71.036°W) near the municipality of Courcelles, in the Estrie administrative
region of southern Québec, Canada. Samples were collected
on the 6-III-2017, 13-III-2017, and 20-III-2017, when fir trees were
still partially covered with snow. Since development rates calculated
from all three collection dates did not vary significantly and only
a small number of eggs were collected at each date, all data were
pooled for analysis. Shoots (n = 200) were randomly cut in a plot
of ~675 trees (i.e., 15 rows of 45 trees), from their southern side.
To avoid premature development within the egg after collection, all
samples were kept at ~2°C, assumed to be near Tmin, until examined
in the laboratory. When an egg was found, the shoot was cut down
to about 1 cm in length and the needles were carefully removed with
a razor blade. Shoot sections with eggs were placed in 2-ml microtubes
(Starstedt AG & Co., Nümbrecht, North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany) with small holes pierced through the lid for air circulation.
For manipulation purposes, two M. abietinus eggs were put
into each microtube. Oligonychus ununguis eggs were usually clustered
onto single shoots, so one randomly selected shoot section,
containing several eggs, was allotted per microtube. All C. pinifoliae
eggs were collected on the 13-III-2017 from another plantation
(45.950°N, 70.923°W) near the municipality of Saint-Évariste-de-
Forsyth, ~10 km from the first site, from a single-generation parthenogenetic
form of the scale. Egg clusters, hidden beneath the waxy
scale, were carefully removed with a fine brush, mixed together, and
randomly distributed in microtubes (~20 eggs per microtube, see
above). Throughout the experiment, we ensured that around 10 μl
of water was kept inside the lid of all microtubes with eggs, in order
to maintain constant high humidity.
Preliminary data, obtained in 2015 for a 25°C constant temperature
regime for M. abietinus and O. ununguis and a fluctuating
temperature regime for C. pinifoliae (i.e., 16 h at 25°C and 8 h at
30°C), were used as starting points to estimate the high temperature
threshold Tmax for nonlinear development rate models. In 2016,
eggs of all three species were collected similarly in the plantations
described above on the 4-IV-2016, for a preliminary experiment on
their developmental response to temperature. Unfortunately, eggs
were collected too late in 2016 to provide meaningful estimates, but
these preliminary data provided key information on appropriate collection
dates and experimental temperatures for the critical experiment
in 2017.
Experimental Temperatures
Experiments on postdiapause development of overwintering eggs
as a function of temperature were started in March 2017. We used
Conviron E15 (Controlled Environments Ltd., Winnipeg, Manitoba,
Canada) growth chambers set to provide a photoperiod of 16:8
(L:D) h and 65% RH. On the basis of preliminary data (see above),
five constant temperature regimes (11, 14, 17, 20, and 23°C) were
used. Only the four higher temperatures were tested for O. ununguis
due to a limiting number of egg clusters. Experimental temperature
and relative humidity were recorded hourly inside each growth
chamber with an HOBO Pro v2 data logger (Onset, Cape Cod, MA,
USA), which confirmed that experimental temperatures remained
within ±0.5°C.
Analytical Methods
Eggs were inspected daily for hatching and mortality (i.e., failure
to hatch). The estimated time to egg eclosion was assumed to have
occurred at midpoint between two consecutive observations (±12-h
precision). In addition, all unhatched eggs were kept for at least a
week after the last observed hatch in the growth chamber, in order
to assure that an accurate rate of survival was recorded.
Development Rate Models
Apart from the GDD linear model, three nonlinear development
rate models, commonly used for illustrating temperature-dependent
development in poikilotherms (Kontodimas et al. 2004), were tested
Environmental Entomology, 2018, Vol. 47, No. 3 717
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/47/3/715/4868565 by Hong Kong Metropolitan University user on 08 April 2025
(Table 2). For model selection, two criteria were used (Roy et al.
2002): first, the model should describe the experimental data accurately,
therefore the coefficient of determination (R2) and the mean
squared error (MSE) were compared between nonlinear models; second,
the model should be able to predict field egg eclosion within
an acceptable timeframe in order to apply the appropriate control
measures in a timely fashion in a plantation (Trudgill et al. 2005).
Field Validation
To validate development rate models parametrized in the laboratory,
the appearance of newly hatched immatures for the three species was
recorded in the field, if present, during three consecutive springs (i.e.,
from 2015 to 2017) and compared with model predictions. For M. abietinus
and O. ununguis, ~50 eggs or larvae were examined on shoots in
the plantations described above on a weekly basis in 2015 and 2016,
around the time when eggs supposedly hatched in the region, for at
least 3 wk. For C. pinifoliae, shoots bearing scales were brought to the
laboratory for closer inspection. In 2017, model predictions for egg
eclosion of M. abietinus and C. pinifoliae were validated by observing
shoots collected on the mean hatching day as predicted by the linear
model. To calculate the accumulation of GDD in the plantation for a
given day, we used an alternative interpretation of the average method
(Equation 1) employed primarily in crop research (McMaster and
Wilhelm 1997, Moore and Remais 2014), which accounts for frequent
temperature fluctuation around the developmental threshold (Tmin):
GDD max min
min = +  
 
  −
2
T
(1)
In this interpretation, the daily temperature minimum δmin equals Tmin
if it falls below the developmental threshold (the same would go if the
daily temperature maximum δmax falls below Tmin). This modification
allows for the accumulation of physiological time even when daily
minimum temperatures do not exceed Tmin. In 2015 and 2016, field
temperatures were recorded hourly in both plantations throughout
the spring with a HOBO Pro v2 data logger installed in the middle
height section of a tree in the southeastern corner of the plantation.
Since temperatures from both plantations actually varied within 1°C
from each other (not shown here), we assumed that these recordings
were representative of all eggs located in the area. Therefore, only one
temperature logger was used in the Courcelles plantation in 2017.
Statistical Analyses: Fitting Development
Rate Models
Data were analyzed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), using the
reciprocal of eclosion time as the development rate for each experimental
temperature T, in order to fit the four development rate models
(Table 2). For nonlinear models, development rate data were used
to parametrize each model by iterative nonlinear regression based
on the Marquardt algorithm (Marquardt 1963). PROC NLIN was
used to fit all nonlinear development rate models with initial values
of graphically-estimated parameters (Brière et al. 1999). Later, biological
temperature parameters were estimated either directly from
the model or indirectly using other model parameters or the first derivative,
where d(Rdev)/d(T) = 0 for T in the Kontodimas-16 model.
PROC REG was used to fit the linear model, with Tmin calculated
indirectly as the unique extrapolated value of T when Rdev = 0, and
the thermal constant K calculated as the reciprocal of the regression
slope b (Table 2) (Ikemoto and Takai 2000, Trudgill et al. 2005).
Results
Development Time Between Species
All results are provided in Table 3 for this section. Of all three species,
M. abietinus always had the shortest egg eclosion time for a
given temperature regime. In comparison with the aphid, the development
of O. ununguis eggs required almost twice the amount of
time before hatching for a given temperature. Eggs of C. pinifoliae
took the longest to hatch for a given temperature regime, more than
doubling the development times of the mite eggs.
Accuracy and Precision of Development
Rate Models
For M. abietinus, explained variation of development rate by the
tested models (R2) was relatively high, varying from 0.8784 to 0.9995,
with MSE varying accordingly (Table 4A). The Kontodimas-16
model failed to match the developmental rates of M. abietinus eggs
observed for temperatures below 14°C and above 20°C (Fig. 1A). Of
the three nonlinear models tested, the Lactin-2 model scored highest
overall and best predicted the development rates measured for
M. abietinus as a function of temperature.

As for O. ununguis eggs, R2 values varied between 0.8963 and
0.9982, with the MSE varying accordingly (Table 4B). Similar to
M. abietinus, the Lactin-2 model scored highest and best predicted
the development rates of the mite for all experimental temperatures.
The Kontodimas-16 failed to predict development rates for at least
half of the experimental temperatures (Fig. 1B) and the Hilbert
and Logan model failed to converge and was thus excluded for
O. ununguis.
Finally, C. pinifoliae development rate models showed similar
trends, with the Lactin-2 model scoring highest among the nonlinear
models and predicting similar development rates for experimental
temperatures as the linear model (Table 4C, Fig. 1C). For this species,
the Hilbert and Logan model failed to predict the development
rates for all five experimental temperatures. For all three species, the
linear model had a relatively high R2 and accurately predicted development
rates (Table 4).
Biological Temperature Parameters
Estimated parameters provided by all four tested models are given
in Table 4, according to species. Although the nonlinear models estimated
all three critical temperature parameters (i.e., Tmin, Topt, and
Tmax), the Lactin-2 model provided the Tmin closest to those estimated
by the linear model. Since Tmax was estimated based on preliminary
data only, nonlinear model predictions most likely provide a minimum
estimate for the actual thermal maximum. Fitted model parameter
estimates (± SE) can be found in the Supp Table 1 (online
only).
Field Validation of the Linear and Lactin-2
Development Rate Models
For 2015, 2016, and 2017, predicted dates for egg eclosion in the
field were estimated using temperatures recorded in situ from the
plantation where eggs came from (Table 5). For validation of the
Lactin-2 model, hourly development rates (and corresponding
physiological time) were calculated for continuously recorded field
temperatures (i.e., one measure per hour) and added sequentially
until a total of 1.00 was reached, indicating that egg development
should then be complete on average. For all three species, the accumulation
of physiological time in the field was assumed to have
begun on March 1, based on preliminary data (not shown here).
Parameters of the linear model, in conjunction with daily maximum
and minimum temperatures (see Equation 1), were used to follow
Table 3. Mean development time and percentage of hatching for postdiapause eggs of three species of Christmas tree herbivores reared

the accumulation of physiological time (i.e., K in GDD) in the field
for all 3 yr (Fig. 2). Here, daily GDD accumulation predicts eclosion,
based on the linear model, to occur where it crosses the gray band.
On the basis of field observations, the egg hatching period lasted less
than a week in 2015 and 2016 (not shown here). Therefore, we can
conclude that the linear model predicted egg eclosion within more
or less 5 d of the observed date in the field for all three species, most
likely within 1 or 2 d of the actual median date of eclosion (Table 5).
In 2017, we observed near complete hatching of M. abietinus eggs
on 28 April, according to the linear model prediction. For C. pinifoliae,
we observed ~50% hatching on the very date predicted by
the linear model. The Lactin-2 model predicted field egg eclosion to
occur between 4 and 11 d later than field observations, relatively late
in the actual eclosion period, depending on species (Table 5).
Discussion
No published study has experimentally examined the effect of such a
range of ambient temperatures on the development rates of M. abietinus
and O. ununguis, the two most important arthropod pests in
commercial Christmas tree plantations of southern Québec. As for
C. pinifoliae, which is known mainly to attack Pinus trees (Nielsen
and Johnson 1973), we hereby provide new insight on its temperature
requirements for populations of southern Québec. Interestingly,
the Lactin-2 model did not provide sufficiently accurate predictions
for egg eclosion in the field when compared with the linear model.
Predicted eclosion dates with this model using hourly-cumulated
field temperatures apparently overestimated development time in
the field because predictions for all three species fell behind those
provided by the traditional linear model (Table 5). In the case of
C. pinifoliae, the Lactin-2 model predicted mean egg eclosion by
up to 11 d later than field-observed hatching. Since the scale eggs
hatched around a month later than both other species, the predictive
error of the Lactin-2 model on hatching could have increased with
time since March 1, which may explain such a difference between
predicted and observed eclosion dates for this species. Temperatures
around 25°C were recorded in May of 2015 and 2017 (J.-F. Doherty,
Université Laval, unpublished data), which would have decreased
development rates according to the Lactin-2 model for C. pinifoliae
and delayed hatching predictions for both years (Fig. 1).
Fitting the Lactin-2 model including the high temperature
threshold, based on preliminary observations, may have decreased

overall development rate predictions for lower temperatures. Since
nonlinear models usually include critical temperature thresholds, the
assumption that development rates are nil at precisely-determined
temperatures may limit their capacity to predict actual development
rates around Tmin and Tmax. Experimental fluctuating temperature
regimes around these critical thresholds could be tested to better estimate
corresponding development rates, which might improve our
capacity to predict field egg eclosion using nonlinear models.
We conclude that the linear model predicted within 5 d before or
after the mean date of eclosion, despite the assumption that physiological
time for egg hatching in the spring is a constant (K) in this
modeling approach. This evidently cannot be true if the development
rate–temperature relation is curvilinear, except for temperatures
between Tmin and Topt. However, our field data from 2017 indicate
that a linear model was useful to predict postdiapause egg eclosion
for the last 3 yr, especially for M. abietinus. The hatching periods in
the field for all three species, depending on temperature conditions,
were short and rarely took more than 5 d. On relatively hot days,
hatching could be near complete in a single day, which was observed
in 2017 for M. abietinus. Therefore, the 95% CI of K could indicate
the emergence period of first generation immatures of the aphid with
sufficient accuracy. Since field consultants and growers usually monitor
pest emergence on a weekly basis, these models can help focus
screening efforts in the field to a certain period of the season for
plantations located in southern Québec.
The average method (i.e., Equation 1) for calculating daily accumulation
of GDD is generally accurate when daily temperatures
oscillate between δmin < Tmin and δmax < Tmax (Moore and Remais
2014), which usually occurs during springtime. Since all five experimental
temperatures tested are most likely within the intermediate
linear response range, sufficient data to efficiently parametrize the
models were provided only by the linear part of the realistic asymmetrical
curve. However, more experimental temperatures, especially
below those of this study, may still improve field predictions of egg
eclosion with nonlinear development rate models, five temperatures
being a recommended minimum (Bergant and Trdan 2006). The
estimation of Tmin by extrapolation beyond the linear fit from five
temperatures tested exposes a weakness in the linear model’s ability
to properly estimate this lower threshold, as it is quite possible that
the actual Tmin lies somewhere below the one provided by the linear
model and that some development does occur below Tmin, despite
being very slow (Lamb 1992).
There is a trend between all three species with regard to their development
times and hatching periods in the field. Predictions based
on the linear model with daily GDD updating indicate a similar
pattern of eclosion (Table 5), verified by field monitoring, except for
O. ununguis in 2016 and 2017, due to very low mite population
densities. This pattern of field eclosion is inversely correlated with
postdiapause development rates. Chionaspis pinifoliae had the lowest
egg development rates at all experimental temperatures and its
eggs also hatched later in the field. The development times of these
species are also correlated with estimated low temperature thresholds.
Chionaspis pinifoliae, which has the highest Tmin estimated at
9.3 ± 0.1°C, is also the last species to emerge in late spring.
The first species to emerge is M. abietinus. Its Holarctic distribution
matches that of its principal host tree, the balsam fir (Martineau
1984). An estimated Tmin of 5.4 ± 0.1°C and a relatively fast postdiapause
development rate in the 11–23°C range can help explain its
early eclosion in the field, relative to both other species. Since stem
mothers must hatch and complete their early nymphal stages before
bud break around mid-May (Doherty et al. 2017), faster postdiapause
development rates than the mite and the scale are expected.
Early egg eclosion may assure the timely migration of stem mothers
onto newly exposed shoots to start producing colonial offspring
on the youngest stages of fir shoot growth. For this timely development
to occur in southern Québec, postdiapause egg development
should be possible at temperatures as low as 5°C, which currently
are most likely experienced in late April. Previous estimates for Tmin
and K dating back from the 1990s in southern Québec for M. abietinus
(i.e., 95 GDD above 2°C), based solely on field observations
(Deland et al. 1998, Berthiaume et al. 2001), underestimate development
times when compared with those estimated here (i.e., 105.9
GDD above 5.4°C). For a slightly more southern climate, thermal
requirements for M. abietinus egg eclosion were estimated at around
53 GDD above 10°C in Lower Michigan, based on field observations
(in this case, Tmin was arbitrarily set to an agricultural standard
for crop plants) (Fondren and McCullough 2003).
The emergence of O. ununguis came second during springtime,
about 2 wk later than the aphid in the plantation. We speculate that
unrequired synchronicity between the hatching of O. ununguis immatures
and fir bud break, assuming that the earliest active stages of the
mite can feed on both the new and past-year foliage, may partly explain
why the mite eggs hatch later in the season than M. abietinus,
whose colonies in pseudogalls can only form on early-stage shoots
before elongation. In Ohio, spruce spider mite eggs hatched during
the final 2 wk of April 1993 and 1994 at 143.3 ± 30.1 GDD above
a Tmin of 7.1°C (Richmond and Shetlar 1996). In this Québec study,
the mite population of a higher latitude requires approximately the
same amount of physiological time above a similar threshold for
egg eclosion (i.e., 161.2 GDD above 7.1°C). Since only 1 yr of field

2017 was not possible.

sampling in 2015 was performed due to very low mite population
densities in the area, it is difficult to say to which extent this new
model is generally valid for populations in southern Québec.
The last species to emerge in late spring, C. pinifoliae, has the
highest estimated Tmin and clearly requires more physiological time
than the aphid and the mite for spring egg hatching, with field eclosion
occurring considerably later during the second week of June
(Table 5). Relatively lower hatch rates were observed for this species
in the growth chambers (Table 3), possibly due to the removal
of the protective waxy scale covering egg clusters, which was done
to allow random assignation to experimental temperatures. Since
eggs in the microtubes were not protected by their scale as in the
field, these unnatural conditions could partly account for the lower
survivorship observed (Table 3). The presence of the waxy scale on
unaltered fir needles and the fact that C. pinifoliae scales were concentrated
on the lower branches of fir trees (personal observation),
microclimatic conditions could differ when temperatures plummet
at sunset. This could partly account for the slight differences in
the observed proportions of egg eclosion in the field when compared
with what was predicted by the linear model and the average
method of GDD accumulation (Table 5). Because proper identification
of the pine needle scale is complex, due to its close proximity
with C. heterophyllae (Philpott et al. 2009), the possibility of cryptic
species (Gwiazdowski et al. 2011, Vea et al. 2012), and the
existence of both sexual and parthenogenetic forms (Stimmann
1969, Luck and Dahlsten 1974), our development rate models for
this scale may not apply generally to different populations. More
work would be needed to determine whether heat requirements
vary among these forms/species. As for the existing model for populations
of lower latitudes (Table 1), it underestimates field egg
eclosion for temperatures recorded in southern Québec.
The fact that all three species overwinter as diapausing eggs
implies that the collection date is a crucial point in calculating the
accumulation of physiological time in the field, assuming that the
linear model is correct and that GDD accumulation for egg development
is a constant. In this study, we assumed that eggs collected
around mid-March had not yet accumulated GDD. On the basis of
preliminary observations (2015 and 2016, unpublished data), we
assumed that overwintering eggs had completed their diapause by
this time and were thus ready to accumulate physiological time in
our experiment. However, if eggs were collected either prior to diapause
termination or after egg development had started, the models
could either overestimate or underestimate eclosion time in the
field. For this experiment, we can assume that eggs had not started

developing by mid-March when they were collected, or that prior
development was negligible, based on temperature recordings in the
plantation (data not shown here).
In conclusion, this study has provided new linear models for
postdiapause egg development of three foliage-feeding arthropod
pests in commercial Christmas tree plantations of southern Québec.
The data support our hypothesis that the existing prediction tools,
based on thermal requirements for other parts of North America
or only from field observations, are not applicable to current populations
from southern Québec, except perhaps to O. ununguis,
whose low population densities prevented model validation. The
sequential pattern of field eclosion for each species can be predicted
from egg development rates measured in the laboratory for temperatures
within their tolerable range. The linear models predicted
mean hatching in the field with sufficient accuracy, as confirmed
using field data from three consecutive years. Modeling based on
experimental temperatures near the low and high thresholds (i.e.,
Tmin and Tmax) should increase the value of nonlinear models in predicting
development rates and field egg eclosion, considering that
they do not depend on the unrealistic assumption that the effect of
temperature on development rates remains linear over the whole
range of viable and developmentally useful thermal conditions.
