Abstract
Background Frailty has long been seen as an indicator of reduced physical functions in the elderly, which may be
caused by a variety of chronic illnesses or cancerous tumors. Dietary fiber was connected with anemia and frailty,
whereas it was uncertain if dietary fiber consumption modifies the impact of anemia on frailty in elderly adults.
Methods We performed a secondary analysis using older adults aged 60 years and over from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2018 cycles. Dietary fiber intake was estimated using two 24-h
dietary recalls. Participants were dichotomized as frail or non-frail based on a modified Fried physical frailty phenotype
from previous NHANES studies. The weighted logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and confidence
interval (CI) for the associations between hemoglobin levels and frailty at high- and low-dietary fiber intake
levels.
Results A total of 9644 older adults were included in this study, and the weighted sample was 56,403,031, of whom
3,569,186 (6.3%) were deemed to be frail, and the remainder were deemed to be non-frail. Among the low dietary
fiber intake group, higher hemoglobin was significantly associated with a lower risk of frailty (OR = 0.79, 95% CI:
0.71–0.87), and anemia was associated with an almost threefold elevated risk of frailty (OR = 3.24, 95% CI:1.98–5.29)
in the fully adjusted model. However, this phenomenon was not observed in groups with high dietary fiber intake.
In addition, L-shaped dose response relationship was found in the high dietary fiber intake group (P overall association
< 0.001; P non-linear association = 0.076). Whereas the dose response relationship was not significant in the high
dietary fiber intake group (P overall association 0.752; P non-linear association = 0.734).
Conclusions Frailty was positively associated with the severity of anemia in older adults with low, but not high,
dietary fiber intake. Adequate fiber intake may be an innovative dietary strategy to reduce frailty in older adults.

Introduction
The outcome of longer life expectancies is an aging world
population [1]. Additionally, compared to 1990 (9.2%),
there will be 21.3% more people worldwide who are 60
or older by 2050 [2]. The majority of an aging person’s
organs will start to fail, which may lead to frailty or prefrailty,
then incapacity, and death [3]. Similar to frailty,
aging may lead to poor physical and mental health, poor
cognitive function, sarcopenia, cardiovascular disease,
and an increased risk of falling. Frailty may also exacerbate
these risks. However, several chronic illnesses may
worsen elderly people’s frailty issues and vice versa [4].
On the other hand, frailty may increase a senior’s susceptibility
to several chronic illnesses. According to a
number of studies [5, 6], frailty can also affect the prognosis
or course of treatment for particular abnormal disorders.
Anemia, which is more common in the elderly
than in other age groups and is thought to be brought on
by blocked iron trafficking, interleukins 1, 6, and 10, or
direct iron deficiency, has been linked to chronic kidney
disease (CKD), infections, and cancer [7]. Finding additional
potential targets that might have an impact on
frailty in older people with anemia is crucial since anemia
is widespread in older people and is expected to prevent
frailty from getting worse.
Despite the fact that older Japanese adults who follow
high-fiber diets are less likely to become frail [8], the lack
of a minimum standard for achieving high dietary fiber
places a significant burden on research into the relationship
between fiber intake and a lower prevalence of frailty
as well as efforts to further promote dietary fiber intake.
Because there are no strict guidelines on the recommended
daily fiber intake, people may consume excessive
amounts of fiber to achieve frailty protection, which
makes increasing fiber intake difficult in low-income
households and places where higher-fiber foods are difficult
to get. The transition to high dietary fiber intake for
older people, which has been documented, also adds to
the difficulties of consuming the right amount of dietary
fiber [9, 10]. According to a recent systematic review [11],
long-fiber interventions should be used to further examine
the role that fiber consumption may play in promoting
dietary iron bioavailability and absorption. In a rat
model [12], dietary fiber from partially hydrolyzed guar
gum increased intestinal iron absorption and hemoglobin
regeneration, which may be a useful treatment for iron
deficiency anemia. In this cohort examination, which is
associated with frailty status in elderly people, the prevalence
of frailty increased when dietary fiber consumption
decreased, according to a multicenter study [13]. However,
it is still unknown if dietary fiber intake affects the
relationship between anemia and frailty in elderly people.
Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) database in the US, the goal of our
inquiry is to ascertain whether there would be a substantial
link between anemia and frailty impacted by dietary
fiber consumption among the aging population.
Methods
Study design and patients
We performed a secondary analysis of the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
2007–2018 cycles. NHANES is a complex, multistage,
and probabilistic sampling design survey conducted
annually and released biannually by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). More details about
NHANES survey procedures are available at https://
www. cdc. gov/ nchs/ index. htm. The NCHS Ethics Review
Board approved the protocol, and all participants provided
an informed consent form (https:// www. cdc. gov/
nchs/ nhanes/ irba98. htm).
The present study data were derived from NHANES
2007–2018 (N = 59842). Participants aged 60 years and
over with at least one reliable 24-h dietary recall, hemoglobin
and frail related data were included (N = 9993).
After further excluding those without complete data for
the model covariates, 9644 participants were considered
eligible for final analysis (Fig. 1).
Dietary fiber intake
Two 24-h dietary recalls were used to assess dietary
intake during the 24-h period prior to the interview.
The first 24-h dietary survey was conducted by trained
researchers in the Mobile Examination Center, and the
second was collected by telephone 3–10 days later. The
US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrient Database
for Dietary Studies was used to calculate dietary
fiber intake from all foods and beverages. Dietary fiber
intake was calculated by averaging two-day dietary recall
data if participants had two-day data available. Otherwise,
a single dietary recall was used.
Modified frailty assessment
Frailty was defined using a modified Fried physical
frailty phenotype from previous NHANES studies [14,
15], which is an acceptable alternative definition in
large research studies when no direct physical measurement
can be used [16, 17]. Criteria included weakness,
low physical activity, exhaustion, slow walking
speed, and unintentional weight loss. Weakness was
defined as self-reported lifting or carrying difficulty.
Low physical activity was defined as the highest quintile
of self-reported minutes of sedentary time by
age groups. Exhaustion was defined as self-reported
tiredness or a lack of energy. Slow walking speed was
defined as self-reported walking difficulty between

rooms on the same floor. Unintentional weight loss
was defined as self-reported unintentional weight loss
(≥ 10 lbs) in the past one year. Frail was defined as having
3–5 criteria.
Covariates
Age, gender, ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, and other races), education (less
than high school and above high school), marital status
(married/with partner and widowed/divorced/separated/
single), smoking (never smoking, former smoking,
and current smoking), body mass index (BMI),
serum lipid level, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease (CVD), and self-reported history of using
lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensive drugs, hypoglycemic
agents, and antiplatelet drugs) were considered
as confounders. The serum lipid level was defined as
the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol. Hypertension was defined as blood
pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg, self-reported, or taking
antihypertensive medications. Diabetes was defined
as a fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, self-reported, or taking
any oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. CVD was
defined as the self-reported diagnosis of heart failure,
coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack or stroke.
Statistical analysis
Considering the complex multistage sampling
design of NHANES, an appropriate sampling weight
(1/6*WTDRD1) was constructed based on NHANES
guidance. Descriptive statistics were presented for demographic
and clinical characteristics by frailty groups.
The continuous variables were expressed as a weighted
mean (standard error, SE) and tested by t-test. The categorical
variables were described as weighted proportions
and compared via the Rao-Scott chi-square test.
The weighted logistic regression was used to estimate
the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) for the
associations between dietary fiber intake and hemoglobin
and frailty. Furthermore, to test whether the association
differed between high and low dietary fiber intake levels,
the study sample was divided into high- and low-dietary
fiber intake subgroups, and associations were estimated
in subgroups. In Model 1, age, gender, and ethnicity were
adjusted. Model 2 incorporated additional adjustments
for marital status, education, BMI, and smoking status.
Furthermore, in Model 3, confounding factors such as
total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol,
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive
drugs, hypoglycemic agents, lipid-lowering
drugs, and antiplatelet drugs were considered for further
adjustments. In addition, restricted cubic splines were

also depicted to assess the dose–response relationship
between hemoglobin and frailty in diverse subgroups.
Finally, a weighted logistic regression was performed to
identify risk factors associated with dietary fiber intake
levels. Analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3,
and P < 0.05 was considered statistical significance.
Results
The demographic and clinical characteristics
of participants
The present analysis comprised 9644 older adults with
complete data from NHANES 2007–2018. The weighted
demographic and clinical characteristics of participants
based on an 8-year weight (1/6*WTDRD1) are presented
in Table 1. The weighted sample was 56,403,031, of whom
3,569,186 (6.3%) were deemed to be frail, and the remainder
were deemed to be non-frail. The weighted average
age was 69.65, and 54.3% of them were female. In the frail
group, age, BMI, the proportions of married/with partner,
below high school education, current smoking, hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive
treatment, hypoglycemic treatment, lipid-lowering treatment,
and antiplatelet treatment were significantly higher
than the non-frail group (All P values < 0.05). In addition,
hemoglobin and dietary fiber intake levels were significantly
lower in the frail group (All P values < 0.05).
Association of hemoglobin and dietary fiber intake
with frail
Model 1 showed that hemoglobin was associated with a
lower risk of frailty (OR = 0.79; P < 0.001), and an increase
in dietary fiber intake was correlated with a lower risk of
frailty (OR = 0.96; P < 0.001) in Table 2. The associations
of hemoglobin and dietary fiber intake with frailty were
still significant in further adjusted model 2 (P < 0.001;
P = 0.005) and model 3 (P < 0.001; P = 0.010).
Association between hemoglobin and frailty in the high
and low dietary fiber intake groups

applied for age, gender, and ethnicity, marital status,

high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive drugs,
hypoglycemic agents, lipid-lowering drugs, and antiplatelet
drugs, higher hemoglobin was significantly associated
with a lower risk of frailty (Continuous: OR = 0.79,
P < 0.001; Q2 vs. Q1: OR = 0.60, P = 0.002; Q3 vs. Q1:
OR = 0.53, P < 0.001; Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.51, P = 0.006;),
and anemia was associated with an almost threefold
elevated risk of frailty (OR = 3.24, P < 0.001) (Table 3).
However, the associations above disappeared in the high
dietary fiber intake group in all multivariate adjusted
models (All P values > 0.05) (Table 3).
Dose–response relationships differed by dietary fiber
intake levels
As depicted in Fig. 2A, an L-shaped dose–response relationship
was found between hemoglobin and the risk
of frailty in the low dietary fiber intake group (P overall
association < 0.001; P non-linear association = 0.076), and
the relationship above began to flatten when hemoglobin
was higher than 13.8 g/dL. Whereas the dose response
relationship was not significant in high dietary fiber
intake group (P overall association = 0.752; P non-linear
association = 0.734) (Fig. 2B).
Hemoglobin differences between dietary fiber intake
levels
As shown in Table 4, compared to high dietary fiber
intake, hemoglobin (13.94 vs. 14.21; P < 0.001) was at a
lower level in the low dietary fiber intake group.
Association between demographics and dietary fiber
intake levels
Multivariable logistic regression results are presented
in Fig. 3. In multivariable logistic regression analysis,
demographics found to be associated with higher dietary
fiber intake levels were male (OR = 2.02, P < 0.001), other
ethnicity (OR = 1.54, P < 0.001), and above high school
(OR = 1.65, P < 0.001). Other demographics associated
with lower odds of having a high dietary fiber intake level
were older (OR = 0.98, P = 0.002), Non-Hispanic Black
(OR = 0.69, P = 0.001), higher BMI (OR = 0.97, P < 0.001),
and current smoking (OR = 0.37, P < 0.001).
Discussion
The study, based on a nationally representative sample of
older individuals in the United States from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
examined whether sufficient dietary fiber consumption
moderated the correlation between anemia and frailty. In
comparison to older individuals without anemia, those
with severe anemia were substantially more frailty. This
study revealed that older individuals with frailty had
lower hemoglobin levels and fiber consumption than
older adults without frailty. Notably, the correlation
between anemia and frailty in elderly adults varies by dietary
fiber consumption, compared to older adults without
anemia. In older individuals with low dietary fiber
consumption, anemia was associated with a higher frailty
risk compared to those without anemia, but no association
was detected in those with high dietary fiber intake.
The higher the severity of anemia, the higher the risk of
frailty. However, this trend was not observed in individuals
with high fiber consumption. The study revealed that
a high intake of dietary fiber may have neglected the negative
effect of anemia on elderly frailty.
Several prospective cohort studies [18, 19] have
established the causal relationship between anemia
and frailty. The Swedish National Study [19] on Aging
and Care in Kungsholmen demonstrated a substantial
correlation between frailty and cardiovascular disease,
anemia, and dementia during a 12-year period. 11.1%
of the 2,122 individuals in the 6-year study developed
frailty, which was associated with a 2.25-fold greater
risk for cardiovascular disease, anemia, and dementia.
The prospective trials conducted in China [20] and
Spain [18, 21] revealed comparable outcomes. There is
evidence that anemia influences a range of chronic diseases
[22, 23] including cancer [24], which are the phenotypes
of aged frailty. With a reported prevalence of

10% to 20% in older adults, anemia is a frequent clinical
disorder that may have both hemodynamic and
nonhemodynamic effects on cardiovascular disease
(CVD). Anemia is a marker for increased risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the population
besides those with heart failure [23]. A cohort
analysis [24] found that the incidence of cancer in the
anemic group was 3% higher than in the control group
(hazard ratio = 1.03; 95% confidence range = 1.01 to
1.05; P = 0.023). Independently, anemia was related
to a higher overall risk of cancer. In accordance with
a previous study, our results demonstrated that anemia
was substantially related to increased frailty in the
elderly with low dietary fiber intake compared to those
with high dietary fiber intake. There is no additional
reduction in the risk of frailty once anemia has been
eliminated, even if hemoglobin levels continue to rise.
The correlation between frailty and anemia might be
explained by the relationship between hemoglobin levels
and frailty risk.
While we may not neglect the fact that dietary fiber
intake varied by several factors throughout our study,
including gender, ethnicity, marriage status, current
smoking, and educational level (Fig. 3), Increased
dietary fiber consumption was associated with higher
dietary fiber intake in males, those with a high school
diploma or higher, and married individuals. In contrast,
low fiber intake was positively associated with the black
race and current smoking. These features of the natural
distribution of dietary fiber intake will help us more
accurately target the intended population, offer preventative
measures for dietary fiber intake, and reduce
the risk of frailty mostly through dietary fiber intake
intervention.

Previous studies confirmed that high dietary fiber
intake reduced the risk of anemia [9, 25, 26]. Compared
to the Low Fiber grouping, the High Fiber group had
increased iron levels (35 vs. 21 mg/day) and a decreased
risk of anemia (10% vs. 25%) in the prospective crosssectional
research [9]. In a prior work [25], the effects of

in rats were investigated. In rats given a WSSF (watersoluble
soybean fiber) diet (50 g/kg diet), iron absorption
and hematological factors of the gastrectomized
rats were equivalent to those of the sham-operated
rats, suggesting that WSSF consumption improves iron
absorption and avoids anemia following gastrectomy. In
a combined study [26], the GDQS (Global Diet Quality
Score) was substantially and marginally rank-correlated
with fiber intakes (r = 0.22 for men and 0.25 for women),
which was strongly linked to better diet, more hemoglobin,
and a lower risk of anemia.
There is a negative correlation between dietary fiber
consumption and several debilitating conditions in senior
citizens. A recent randomized single-blind study [27]
showed that supplementing with dietary fiber for 4 weeks
can lower residents of long-term care facilities’ use of laxatives
and may be a useful way to treat constipation. Residents’
frailty can be lessened by either lowering drug use
or treating constipation. A meta-analysis [28] revealed
that people with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
consume considerably less dietary fiber than healthy
individuals. Meanwhile, individuals with IBD are more
susceptible to malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies,
anemia, and osteoporosis if they fail to consume a healthy
diet. Accordingly, a high dietary fiber intake may lower
the risk of overall mortality. Seven prospective cohort
studies [29] found that people who consumed the most
fiber had a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval:
0.74–0.81) in frailty compared to those who consumed
the least fiber. From 2009 to 2014, the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [30] discovered
that the quantity of total fiber and cereal fiber
in a person’s diet was associated with a decreased risk of
hyperuricemia, applying thresholds of 7.0 mg/dL for men
and 6.0 mg/dL for women. A dose–response meta-analysis
[31] of the link between dietary fiber intake and ovarian
cancer risk revealed a substantial negative correlation
(an increase of 10 g/day; combined RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82,
0.93) between dietary fiber intake and ovarian cancer
risk. Zheng et al. [32] discovered that consuming more
whole grains overall was linked to a lower incidence of
bladder cancer (BC). High consumption of whole grains
and dietary fiber is related to a lower incidence of insulin
sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and inflammatory processes,
which are recognized cancer risk factors. Numerous
studies [33–35] have demonstrated that dietary fiber consumption
is linked to malignancies and chronic illnesses,
which raise the risk of frailty in the elderly. Increased
dietary fiber consumption [36] lowers the risk of acquiring
a number of chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and various malignancies,
and has been linked to a lower body weight. The average
American consumes 17 g of dietary fiber per day, with
just 5% of the population achieving the recommended
amount. Dietary fiber consists of a complex collection
of non-digestible compounds, mostly polysaccharides.
Multiple epidemiological studies [37] have shown statistically
significant decreases in the risks of obesity, type 2
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, and premenopausal
breast cancer with greater fiber intakes. A
high intake of fiber may increase gut hormones, which
may operate through pathways including G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPRs), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and
aromatase enzymes. Consequently, fiber consumption
results in reduced glucose levels and insulin sensitivity,
thereby decreasing the incidence of T2DM, CVD, and
some malignancies.
However, no prior research has examined whether dietary
fiber may affect the association between anemia and
frailty. Based on this prior research, our study expanded
on these results by evaluating how dietary fiber alters
the connection between anemia and cognitive performance.
Our investigation indicated negative connections
between older individuals’ hemoglobin levels and frailty.
The findings revealed that the link between hemoglobin
level and frailty was inconsistent at various levels of dietary
fiber consumption, suggesting that the detrimental
relationship between uncontrolled anemia and frailty
may be mitigated by dietary fiber intake. Increasing dietary
fiber consumption may be a possible treatment strategy
for frailty in elderly individuals with uncontrolled
anemia.
The risk of anemia nearly tripled among those who
were frail. In order to develop nutritional therapies that
successfully reduce frailty, it is necessary to pinpoint the
specific problems connected to the dietary practices of
individuals based on sex differences, as stated in a Japanese
observational study [8]. If they consumed less soluble
dietary fiber, potassium, folate, and vitamin C, men
and women were more likely to be frail. Only 35.5% of
the Japanese individuals consumed enough dietary fiber,
and more than 80% of them acquired adequate protein,
copper, vitamin B12, and pantothenic acid. In this study,
88.9% of participants had excessive salt intake, and less
than 90% had appropriate fiber intake [38, 39]. The British
Regional Heart Study [40], including 945 men aged
70 to 92 years old without prevalent frailty, implied that
adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet was connected
with a decreased risk of frailty in older people. A high-fat,
low-fiber diet pattern increased the risk of frailty. Previous
studies [41] have demonstrated that the hepcidin
hormone, which controls iron homeostasis by proteolytically
destroying ferroportin, the only identified iron
exporter in mammals, modulates iron bioavailability during
pregnancy. Low blood hepcidin levels enhance dietary
iron translocation across the placenta and maternal
Zhang et al. BMC Geriatrics (2023) 23:634 Page 9 of 11
iron absorption, which enhances neonatal iron status.
Blood hepcidin concentrations in pregnant women were
positively correlated with the quantity of fiber they consumed.
According to a study from the NHANES database
[42], a substantial proportion of young children are
at risk of inadequate fiber intake. Despite adequate iron
intake, serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels indicated
that 7.4% and 2.5% of patients, respectively, displayed
iron deficiency and anemic symptoms. Based on this
analysis, it appears that dietary fiber may control anemia
in ways other than influencing iron absorption. Lustgarten
MS [43] discovered that a high-fiber diet may be a
key strategy for enhancing the kidney-gut-muscle axis in
ESRD (end-stage renal disease) patients and healthy older
people. By fermenting dietary fiber, gut bacteria produce
the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate,
and butyrate. Since excessive Wnt signaling is typically
observed in colorectal cancer, it is conceivable that larger
intakes of dietary fiber and the fermentation product
butyrate protect against the illness by regulating the Wnt
pathway, as demonstrated by a randomized controlled
experiment [44]. The underlying mechanisms of dietary
fiber in modulating chronic diseases and cancers, which
increase the risk of frailty, have been demonstrated in
prior research. Dietary fiber may have a more significant
influence on enhancing frailty performance in elderly
adults with untreated anemia compared to those without
anemia. However, the precise mechanism remains
unknown and requires additional investigation. There is
a health advantage to dietary fiber, but the reality is that
the global daily consumption of dietary fiber is woefully
insufficient. The average consumption of dietary fiber
in the United States, the United Kingdom, and China is
much less than the 25–35 g/day recommended by the
World Health Organization. In our research, the average
consumption of dietary fiber was lower than that of those
without anemia; elderly individuals with untreated anemia
had a much lower consumption of dietary fiber. The
findings showed that adequate fiber consumption should
be considered a nutritional intervention to minimize
the incidence of frailty in elderly adults with untreated
anemia.
Our study has several strengths. Compared to elderly
adults without anemia, those with severe anemia were
much more frailty than their counterparts. This tendency
was not noticed among those with a high fiber
intake. Analyzing older individuals with and without
anemia, the connection between anemia and frailty varied
significantly according to fiber intake. In addition,
subsequent research revealed that anemia status and
dietary fiber intake interacted to promote frailty. The
research found that a high consumption of dietary fiber
may have mitigated the harmful impact of anemia on
geriatric frailty. The findings suggest that the severity
of anemia in relation to hemoglobin levels is associated
with an increased risk of frailty in the elderly. However,
this link will disappear in the absence of anemia. Therefore,
we can conclude that a sufficient intake of dietary
fiber may be required to avoid frailty in elderly patients
with anemia. This investigation may provide a unique
nutrition management technique for reducing frailty
in older people with anemia. Health officials have to
implement nutrition screening to increase fiber intake.
Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged.
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study,
it was not possible to determine a causal relationship
between dietary fiber intake, anemia, and frailty in the
elderly. Measurement errors caused by 24-h dietary
recalls may cause biases in target dietary fiber intake
estimates. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility
that chronic diseases or cancers have a potential
influence on anemia, which may cause frailty. More
research is required to confirm our findings and investigate
their sources and implications. In addition, many
iron deficiency indicators associated with frailty, such
as serum ferritin [45], soluble transferrin receptors
(sTfR) [46] or transferrin saturation [47], were not studied
in the NHANES database in the elderly. These factors
should be considered in future studies.
Conclusion
The results indicate that the severity of anemia in
relation to hemoglobin levels is connected with an
increased risk of frailty in the elderly. A high intake of
dietary fiber can minimize its adverse effects. It was
proposed that appropriate dietary fiber intake may be
essential to preventing frailty in anemic elderly adults.
This study could offer a novel nutrition management
strategy for preventing frailty in elderly individuals
with anemia. Health administrators should employ
nutrition screening to boost fiber consumption. Future
prospective and interventional investigations are
required to validate our findings.
