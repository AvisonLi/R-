Abstract
Strategies to reduce obesity have become public health priorities as the prevalence of obesity has risen in the United States and around the world. While the
anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are well known, their antiobesity effects
and efficacy against metabolic syndrome, especially in humans, are still under debate. In animal models, evidence consistently suggests a role for n-3 PUFAs in
reducing fat mass, particularly in the retroperitoneal and epididymal regions. In humans, however, published research suggests that though n-3 PUFAs may not
aid weight loss, they may attenuate further weight gain and could be useful in the diet or as a supplement to help maintain weight loss. Proposed mechanisms by
which n-3 PUFAs may work to improve body composition and counteract obesity-related metabolic changes include modulating lipid metabolism; regulating
adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin; alleviating adipose tissue inflammation; promoting adipogenesis and altering epigenetic mechanisms.

1. Introduction
The American Medical Association recognizes obesity as a disease
[1] and considers it a major public health problem. In the United States,
36.5% of adults are obese [2], while approximately 39% of the world’s
adult population is overweight and more than 13% are obese [3].
Obesity increases morbidity risks for heart disease, type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) and some types of cancer [4]. Metabolic changes
associated with these diseases comprise metabolic syndrome (MetS),
which is diagnosed when three of the following five conditions exist:
abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides (TG), reduced high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, high blood pressure and elevated
fasting blood glucose [5].
Lipids are key macronutrients in the human diet. The type and
proportion of dietary fatty acids consumed impact health and wholebody
physiology [6]. Research has shown that saturated fatty acids
(SFAs) are detrimental to health, while monounsaturated (MUFAs)
and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) offer health benefits [7]. In
the diet, fatty fish and fish oil rich in omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs, such as
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have
demonstrated cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic
properties. Hence, these fatty acids may assist in the
treatment and prevention of obesity comorbidities, especially by
improving individual components of the metabolic syndrome [7–9].
Therefore, the effect of n-3 PUFAs on body weight and body
composition is of particular interest.
In this review, we provide an update on the effects of n-3 PUFAs on
obesity and MetS in both animal and human studies, highlighting
potential mechanisms for n-3 PUFAs in reducing body weight,
improving body composition and counteracting the adverse metabolic
consequences of obesity.
2. Adipose tissue and obesity
Body fat is primarily stored in adipose tissue, a connective tissue
composed of adipocytes, preadipoctyes, vascular endothelial cells,
fibroblasts and various types of immune cells, including adipose tissue
macrophages [10]. Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that
secretes numerous hormones, including leptin and adiponectin, and
cytokines (adipokines) such as interleukin (IL)-6 [11]. Three major
types of adipose tissue have been identified: white adipose tissue
(WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige (“brite”) adipose tissue.
WAT is primarily responsible for energy storage in the form of TG and
the release of fatty acids during periods of fasting; it is mainly located
in two distinct depots, as subcutaneous adipose tissue or visceral
adipose tissue [10]. The adipocytes of visceral fat surrounding internal
organs are more metabolically active than those of subcutaneous
adipose tissue and thus contribute to the risks of cardiovascular
disease and T2DM [12]. BAT plays a key role in thermogenesis and is
mainly found above the clavicle and scapula in adults [12]. Obesity
leads to adipose tissue dysfunction, which is mechanistically linked to
the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the liver and in skeletal
muscle (Fig. 1) and may result in MetS [13].
While weight loss via lifestyle modification is the primary
treatment in the management of obesity and its comorbidities,
compliance is difficult. Adjunct treatments for the management of
obesity include pharmaceuticals [14], surgery [15] and dietary
supplements [16]. Despite these measures, however, the prevalence
of obesity has continued to rise. Thus, alternative strategies to assist in
weight loss and reduce body fat are necessary. Natural bioactives such
as n-3 PUFAs present few side effects and so may be safer than other
modalities for the treatment of obesity. This review summarizes
current basic and clinical research and mechanistic insights regarding
the effects of n-3 PUFAs on obesity.
3. Omega-3 fatty acids
3.1. Synthesis and metabolism
The human body can synthesize many fatty acids, but not linoleic
acid (LA; omega-6; C18:2 n-6) or α-linolenic acid (ALA; C18:3 n-3),
which must be consumed in the diet. ALA is the precursor for EPA
(C20:5 n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; C22:5 n-3) and DHA (C22:6
n-3) in the human body (Fig. 2) [6]. Many studies have found low
conversion rates of ALA to EPA and DPA, and little to no DHA synthesis
[17,18]; hence, any direct benefits of these very long chain fatty acids
depend on dietary intake [17]. Both dietary intake and fatty acid
desaturase activity determine plasma n-3 PUFA levels [19]. A balanced
n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio (1:1 to 2:1 is optimal) is important for
homeostasis and normal development throughout the lifespan. High
n-6 PUFA intake in the Western diet increases the n-6:n-3 ratio to a
range from 10:1 to 20:1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of
obesity and related diseases [19,20].
3.2. Sources of omega-3 PUFAs
Dietary sources of n-3 PUFAs are much less abundant than n-6
PUFAs. ALA is synthesized by plants from LA and can thus be found in
green leafy vegetables, seeds such as flaxseed (linseed), nuts and
legumes. Vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, perilla, canola and
soybean also provide ALA but are much more abundant in LA. Fish,
such as salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, anchovy, bluefish, herring,

Fig. 1. Adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle cross talk in obesity and insulin resistance. The liver maintains normoglycemia during fasting via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
Following a meal, increased glucose delivery to the pancreas stimulates insulin secretion, which acts on the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The primary action of insulin on the
liver is to suppress hepatic glucose output, while insulin increases glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin additionally inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue. In
obesity, changes in adipokines produced and released from adipose tissue, such as decreased adiponectin and increased TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines, coupled with
increased free fatty acids contribute to hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance.

more anti-inflammatory. ISOPS, isoprostanes; COX, cyclooxygenases; LOX, lipooxygenases.

mullet, sturgeon and sardines, are also rich sources of n-3 PUFAs,
particularly EPA and DHA. Lean fish, such as cod, store lipids in their
liver, and for this reason, cod liver oil is a good source of n-3 PUFAs.
Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna, store lipids
throughout their bodies and are good whole sources of n-3 PUFAs [6].
The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming
about 8 oz per week of seafood, which would provide about 250 mg/
day of EPA and DHA [21]. The recommended intake for n-3 PUFAs
corresponds to consuming fish twice weekly, including one serving of
oily fish. Even though there is ample evidence for a role of n-3 PUFAs in
modulating chronic diseases, an optimal dose has not been agreed
upon, and recommendations vary based on governing body. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has stated that levels up to 3 g/day are
generally recognized as safe [22], although other authorities have
reported no adverse effects at up to 5–6 g/day [23]. It has been
suggested that the bioavailability of n-3 PUFAs is improved by
emulsification. Emulsified n-3 PUFA is more easily exposed to
pancreatic lipase and colipase, enhancing its digestion. Additionally,
emulsified n-3 PUFA is easily transported into enterocytes, thus
increasing fatty acid absorption [24,25].
3.3. Dietary omega-3 PUFA intake, obesity and metabolic disorders
Dietary fish intake is considerably higher in people of the
circumpolar arctic regions and relatively much lower in those living
in the United States, Australia, France and the United Kingdom. Fish
intake closely reflects n-3 PUFA consumption, with intakes of
approximately 3 to 4 g/day by Eskimos, 5 to 6 g/day by Japanese,
0.189 g/day by Australians and 0.25 g/day by Europeans and North
Americans [26,27]. After it was reported that Japanese and Eskimo
populations had healthier metabolic profiles associated with elevated
plasma n-3 PUFA levels attributed to high fatty fish intake [28], many
prospective studies began to examine whether fish or fish oil intake
prevents the development of obesity.
The Health Professional Follow-up Study suggested that men with
a high level of fish consumption were less likely to be overweight [29].
In contrast, the Nurses’ Health Study found that women with higher
fish intake (two or more fish meals per week) had a higher risk of
being overweight [30]. In China, data from the Shanghai Women’s and
Men’s Health studies found similar indices of body mass among groups
of varying fish intake [31]. Clearly, findings of prospective studies
regarding the beneficial effects of fish intake on obesity are far from
agreement. The evident discrepancies may have arisen due to differing
or inadequate methods of data collection on fish intake (food
frequency questionnaires), differences in cooking methods and
other unaccounted for lifestyle practices (exercise, etc.) from study
to study and among different study populations.
Plasma, erythrocyte and tissue n-3 PUFA concentrations are largely
determined by consumption and thus may be taken to accurately
reflect n-3 PUFA consumption. Plasma levels of fatty acids reflect
recent intake, whereas tissue levels of fatty acids reflect long-term
intake [32,33]. Erythrocyte fatty acid content (i.e., the omega-3 index)
correlates with fatty acid intake and parallels tissue concentrations
and thus is more reflective of long-term intake [34]. An increase in n-
6:n-3 ratio [35] and overall lower serum phospholipid n-3 concentrations,
particularly of DHA have been associated with obesity,
specifically waist circumference measures [36] in obese adolescents
[35] and obese adults [36]. Thus, prospective studies on the
relationship between plasma and erythrocyte fatty acid content and
the long-term risk of obesity are warranted to clarify this issue.
4. Omega-3 PUFA in animal studies
Animal studies performed to investigate the antiobesity effects of
n-3 PUFA have used a variety of models, diet compositions, and n-3
PUFA compositions and doses. Such differences across experimental
designs complicate the interpretation of their results into cohesive and
conclusive findings (Table 1).
4.1. Omega-3 PUFA, energy intake and obesity
Studies relating effects on body weight and energy intake with n-3
PUFA supplementation are inconsistent; while some show either
decreased [37,38] or increased energy intake [39], most show
unchanged energy intake with the addition of n-3 PUFA or with
varying n-3 PUFA doses [40–57]. Only one study performed with
female mice reported decreased energy intake with no significant
effect on body weight [38].
Supplementation with n-3 PUFA prevented high-fat (HF)-dietinduced
weight gain in a number of rodent studies, most of which
supplemented an HF diet provided from the start, concurrent with
inducing obesity [41,43,45,48,49,51]. Several studies have utilized a
design that investigated the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA to reverse dietinduced
weight gain and related metabolic changes by adding n-3
PUFA to the HF diet at approximately midstudy [46,47,58,59]. Our lab
found that mice on an EPA reversal diet (6 weeks of HF followed by 5
weeks of HF-EPA) had body weights similar to mice fed the HF-only
diet [47]. In a different study, body weight decreased significantly at
the beginning of the 6-week reversal period, returning to weights
similar to the low-fat-fed group for the remainder of the study (18
weeks total) [58]. Taken together, these studies suggest that
antiobesity effects of N-3 PUFA in mice are predominantly seen
when it is fed from the start rather than introduced after obesity is
already established.
4.2. Omega-3 PUFA and insulin resistance
Obesity leads to insulin resistance, which is at least in part
responsible for the pathogenesis of MetS [13]. Most weight loss
interventions improve insulin resistance. Similarly,most animal studies
document a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on insulin sensitivity [60].
Since n-3 PUFAs induce weight loss in rodent models of obesity, it is
difficult to statewhether there are direct effects of n-3 PUFAs on insulin
sensitivity. By contrast,we have shownweight-independent benefits of
EPA on insulin sensitivity in HF-diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice.
These EPA-fed mice had significantly improved homeostatic model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores when compared to
HF-fed mice, despite similar body weights [47].
4.3. Animal study conclusions
Thus far, most rodent studies have shown an antiobesity effect of n-
3 PUFA, while fewer studies have found no change in body weight
[37,39–41,44–46,49,51–57,59,61,62]. These studies do suggest that n-
3 PUFA plays a role in reducing adipose tissue mass [40], particularly in
the epididymal [39,42,43,46,49,52,53,56,57,61–64] and retroperitoneal
locations [37,39,41,46,49,57]. Differences in the outcomes of
studies on the effects of n-3 PUFA on body weight could be due to
differing animal models of obesity (genetic vs. diet-induced obesity),
the content of the diet (HF vs. high sucrose), the n-3 PUFA (EPA or
DHA) formulation, the form of n-3 PUFA (TG form or as ethyl ester)
provided or various combinations of these factors. Differences in n-3
PUFA dosage and duration may contribute to differences in outcomes
as well. Failure to assess energy expenditure also limits meaningful
comparisons. The combination of calorie restriction and n-3 PUFA
supplementation may be the most effective strategy for reducing
weight and improving body composition [54]. Interestingly, Ruzickova
et al. extrapolated findings from their animal study to humans to
suggest that with a daily intake of 100 g dietary fat, 11 g of EPA/DHA
would be required to limit weight gain [42]. Few animal studies have

feasible in humans [42,45,64]. It should be noted, however, that
human studies of fish oil intake among Eskimo and Japanese
populations have shown beneficial effects of these fatty acids even
at intake levels below 11 g/day. Since these populations consume
more fish and less red meat, it is plausible that a relatively lower
arachidonic acid (AA) intake leading to a decreased n-6:n-3 ratio is
contributing to the beneficial effects observed.
5. Omega-3 PUFA and weight loss in humans
There are a variety of approaches to investigating the effects of n-3

interventions that use different types of fish and varying levels of fish
oil content, particularly EPA and DHA (Table 2). Fish and fish oil have
also been used in addition to a variety of weight loss and dietary
interventions of different durations with or without an exercise
regimen. Participants have ranged from healthy to obese, with a
variety of obesity-associated disorders, including T2DM, hyperinsulinemia
and other features of MetS. The control, or type of placebo,
which consists of assorted oils containing n-6 PUFA, such as sunflower,
corn, soybean and paraffin oils, also varies among studies.
With n-3 PUFA supplementation alone, studies report no change in
body weight (Table 2). One study in healthy adults supplemented with
fish oil diets demonstrated decreased body fat mass, basal respiratory
quotient and increased basal lipid oxidation when dietary intake was
controlled [65]. Another study found reduction in fat mass along with
significantly increased lean mass (fat-free mass) despite no alterations
in total body mass, resting metabolic rate (RMR) or respiratory
exchange ratio when compared to placebo supplementation [66].
Participant-reported diet diaries indicate significant reductions in
carbohydrate, fat and total caloric intake with n-3 PUFA supplementation
in one study [67], but others show no change in energy intake
[68–71]. Since most studies only report total caloric intake, the effect
of n-3 PUFA supplementation on macronutrient and energy intake
should be repeated in larger studies to conclusively determine the role
of n-3 PUFA in weight loss in humans.
5.1. Omega-3 PUFA in combination with dietary interventions
Weight loss results appear more promising when n-3 PUFA
supplementation is combined with calorie restriction (Table 3), but
it is difficult to draw conclusions due to the variety of calorie
restriction programs in different studies. Greater improvements in
metabolic parameters, such as improved insulin resistance and
decreased TGs, were attained with combined n-3 PUFA supplementation
and calorie restriction compared to calorie restriction alone
[72–74] or replacement of SFA [71]. Interestingly, results appear to be
independent of the source, form or dose, i.e., different fish species
(salmon, tuna, sardines, etc.) or fish oil capsules, of n-3 PUFA supplied
[72,73,75]. This was confirmed by Thorsdottir et al., who compared the
effects of various fish (cod or salmon) and fish oil (DHA/EPA capsules)
in conjunction with 30% calorie restriction on weight loss in young,
overweight adults for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks, men receiving cod,
salmon or fish oil capsules lost approximately 1 kg more than those on
30% calorie restriction alone. The fish species and fish oil capsules
supplied various amounts of n-3 PUFA: 0.3 g/day from cod, 3.0 g/day
from salmon and 1.5 g/day from fish oil capsules, yet the n-3 PUFA
dose did not influence weight loss outcomes. This suggests that
variations in weight loss benefits may not depend solely on variations
in n-3 PUFA dosages from study to study [76].
Rapid weight loss, induced by a very low calorie diet, alters adipose
tissue and serum fatty acid composition [77,78]. Supplementation
with n-3 PUFA during rapid weight loss increases serum n-3 PUFA
concentrations [79] and may help prevent unfavorable changes in
fatty acid tissue composition and essential fatty acid deficiency [77].
Some studies have utilized n-3 PUFA supplementation prior to a
weight loss intervention, such as dietary restriction and/or an exercise
regimen, and reported significant reductions in weight [80], while
others observed no changes in body mass index (BMI) or body
composition, particularly in insulin-resistant individuals [81]. Nonetheless,
this type of study design should be refined and pursued
further due to the relationship between tissue/plasma/erythrocyte n-
3 PUFA concentrations and obesity. It will be important to verify if
increasing n-3 PUFA concentrations prior to interventions would aid in
weight loss and ameliorate obesity related metabolic dysfunctions.

5.2. Omega-3 PUFA and exercise
Others have explored the influence of n-3 PUFA in conjunction
with exercise and with or without a dietary intervention to determine
if the addition of n-3 PUFA leads to greater weight loss (Table 4). With
the addition of n-3 PUFA to an exercise regimen and dietary
intervention, only one study has shown a decrease in body weight
[82]. However, only a few such studies have been conducted, and the
dietary intervention consisted of nutritional counseling rather than a
prescribed diet [83,84].
The combined effects of n-3 PUFA and exercise are currently
unknown. Well-designed placebo-controlled randomized clinical
trials are lacking [85], as they require healthy and lean participants
[86]. Differences in the intensity and forms of exercise (i.e., aerobic or
resistance training) employed prevent valid comparisons across
studies. The addition of n-3 PUFA to aerobic training without dietary
intervention has resulted in decreases in fat mass [87]. Furthermore,
the addition of n-3 PUFA to resistance training without dietary
intervention resulted in increases in lean mass [88] and improved
muscle quality [89].
5.3. Limitations in human studies
Overall, findings on the effects of n-3 PUFA in humans are
inconclusive. Improvements in study design and analyses could help
resolve apparent inconsistencies in the effects of n-3 PUFA on weight
and body composition. For example, sex, metabolic phenotype and
geographic location should be taken into consideration in addition to
n-3 PUFA supplementation. There is also a case for evaluating
translation to real-world weight-loss diets, which are complicated
by the need to control for eating behavior and physical activity. Even
when participants are supplied with food, outpatient studies are
difficult to translate because measurements of adherence to the
recommended interventions [90] generally rely on self-reporting.
Hence, studies using inpatient feeding and analysis of energy
utilization should be carried out [91].
Failure to assess energy expenditure in human studies limits our
understanding of the associations between n-3 PUFA status and
decreased adiposity, weight loss and energy balance, especially when
energy intake is unchanged. This highlights the need for tightly
controlled studies, similar to that of Hall et al., to validate fuel
partitioning and n-3 PUFA influence on metabolism in humans.
Unfortunately, work of this nature is expensive, labor intensive and
generally of short duration with small sample sizes [91].
Other limitations on current human studies of n-3 PUFA supplementation
include the use of less reliable anthropometric methods
[92] and failure to dose according to body weight to meet the
threshold of tissue membrane n-3 PUFA phospholipid enrichment
[93]. Finally, it is of utmost importance to utilize a standardized
method, such as the omega-3 index, to assess n-3 PUFA status, the

biological effects of n-3 PUFA and n-3 PUFA related metabolites [34].
Future human studies should employ this method to verify that n-3
PUFA consumption parallels n-3 PUFA concentrations in the body.
6. Mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA improve adiposity and
metabolic disorders
There are several proposed mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA could
work in reducing body weight and improving the metabolic profile
(Fig. 3). These include alterations in adipose tissue gene expression;
changes in adipokine release; adipokine-mediated or adipokinerelated
pathways; appetite suppression; alterations in carbohydrate
metabolism; increases in fat oxidation; increases in energy expenditure
(possibly through thermogenesis); activating mechanisms
involved in muscle anabolism; and, lastly, influence on epigenetics.
6.1. Omega-3 PUFA and adipogenesis
Adipose tissue expansion in obesity occurs via adipocyte hypertrophy
(enlargement of adipocytes) and hyperplasia (increase in
adipocyte number due to adipogenesis). The latter is associated with
smaller adipocyte size and a metabolically healthy phenotype. Both n-
3 and n-6 PUFAs can bind and/or regulate transcriptional factors that
control genes involved in preadipocyte differentiation. PUFAs,
particularly AA and its metabolites, serve as ligands for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) gamma (PPARγ) and delta
(PPARδ) to induce fat cell differentiation and accelerate maturation by
elevating lipoprotein lipase expression in vitro [94,95]. Elevated
concentrations of n-6 and n-3 PUFA in human subcutaneous tissue
correlate with reduced adipocyte size; increased SFA concentrations
lead to increased fat cell size [96]. Differences in fatty acid
concentrations are more strongly associated with abdominal subcutaneous
than visceral adipose tissue [35].
Studies performed in clonal adipocytes (3T3-L1) also demonstrate
up-regulation in PPARγ expression, adipogenesis and lipid droplet
formation after the addition of n-3 PUFA [43,97]. Taken together, these
studies suggest that n-3 PUFAs promote adipogenesis and a healthy
expansion of adipose tissue during positive energy balance, promoting
a metabolically healthy phenotype.
6.2. Adipose tissue inflammation
Chronic low-grade inflammation and changes in adipokine
patterns are key factors in the pathogenesis of metabolic derangements
in obesity (Fig. 1). Indeed, a relationship exists between BMI,
body fat percentage and inflammatory markers [98]. Omega-3 PUFAs
inhibit nuclear transcription factor kappa B, a key transcription factor
in cytokine gene expression and inflammation [99]. In humans and in
vitro, n-3 PUFAs also have a documented role in reducing cytokines,
including IL-1 [100,101], IL-6 [102] and TNF-α [100,103], which are all
elevated in obesity. (For an extensive review of mechanisms of n-3
PUFA and adipose tissue inflammation, see Kalupahana et al., 2011).
Omega-3 PUFAs act as agonists for different members of the free
fatty acid receptor family (FFARs) present on a variety of cell types
involved in both energy homeostasis and the inflammatory response.
A number of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids can
activate FFAR1 and FFAR4 [104,105]. Agonist stimulation that impedes
the inflammatory response occurs through activation of the Gprotein-
independent signaling pathway through interaction with β-
arrestin proteins, which may further interact with the transforming
growth factor kinase protein (TAK1) and binding protein (TAB-1).
Stimulation of FFAR4 or β-arrestin inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
mediated release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6
in the macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7. In fact, decreased
macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue has been shown in mice
fed an n-3-PUFA-enriched diet, possibly via activation of FFAR4 (Gprotein-
coupled receptor 120). Since n-3 PUFAs are unable to reduce
Fig. 3. Mechanisms mediating effects of n-3 PUFA on liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle metabolism. Omega-3 PUFAs increase fatty acid oxidation in the liver, adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle, thus limiting fat storage in these tissues. Omega-3 PUFAs also decrease the production and release of proinflammatory adipokines. In skeletal muscle, n-3 PUFAs
promote protein synthesis. All mechanisms depicted here contribute to an improved metabolic profile.
K. Albracht-Schulte et al. / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 58 (2018) 1–16 9
adipose tissue macrophage infiltration in FFAR4 knockout mice, this
highlights the mechanistic importance of FFAR4 in mediating the antiinflammatory
effects of n-3 PUFA [106]. Furthermore, fish oil
supplementation (4 g n-3 PUFA/day) in obese humans has been
associated with decreased M1 macrophage presence in adipose tissue
and subsequent decreases in proinflammatory markers, such as IL-8
[107]. Accordingly, monocytes differentiate preferentially into M1
macrophages when treated with human postprandial triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins following a meal rich in saturated fatty acids, versus a
meal high in MUFA or PUFA, after which they shift towards M2
macrophages [108].
Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs halt inflammatory processes by inhibiting
activation of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domainlike
receptor; NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome
via an arrestin-FFAR4-dependent pathway [109], which triggers a
caspase-dependent cascade, resulting in the release of proinflammatory
cytokines [110]. The n-3 PUFA DHA acts through FFAR1 or FFAR4
to suppress caspase-1 activity via formation of a β-arrestin-2/NLRP3 or
NLRP1b complex and thus decrease the release of proinflammatory
cytokines [109].
Omega-3 PUFAs also influence lipid rafts, which are cholesteroland
sphingolipid-rich areas of the plasma membrane [111] that can
form signaling platforms [112,113]. Incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into
plasma membranes disrupts lipid rafts [114] and hence could mediate
anti-inflammatory and antichemotactic n-3 PUFA properties.
6.3. Adipokine secretion
Several studies have shown that n-3 PUFAs modulate adipokine
secretion. Obese individuals have high plasma leptin levels [115]
suggestive of leptin resistance. Conversely, weight loss leads to
parallel decreases in plasma leptin levels [116]. This weight-lossassociated
decrease in leptin could contribute to hunger and a lower
metabolic rate and ultimately lead to weight regain [117]. EPA
supplementation attenuates the decrease in blood leptin levels that
occurs during weight loss in obese women, suggesting a potentially
significant role of EPA in weight loss maintenance [118]. Indeed, EPA
increases the production of leptin in rodents and cultured adipocytes
[37,119], suggesting a direct effect of n-3 PUFA on leptin production.
However, the few studies that have assessed the role of n-3 PUFA in
weight maintenance have found no significant effect on weight or
blood leptin concentrations between n-3-PUFA-supplemented subjects
compared to other weight loss groups [120,121]. Omega-3-PUFAmediated
effects on leptin are dependent on a number of factors, such
as diet composition and energy balance, which could cause conflicting
results.
Independent of body weight, both animal [37,48,122] and human
[123,124] studies have found significant increases in blood levels of
the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin, following n-3 PUFA
consumption. EPA appears to regulate adiponectin levels at the
translational or posttranslational level rather than at the transcriptional
level [123]. It has been proposed that the anti-inflammatory
properties of n-3 PUFA supplementation induce an increase in
adipocyte adiponectin production [123] and improve leptin sensitivity
[125]. This type of interplay could have a significant influence on body
weight regulation. An inverse relationship between serum adiponectin
concentrations and TNF-α has also been demonstrated in ob/ob
mice [123] and in overweight and insulin-resistant children following
n-3 PUFA supplementation [126].
Fatty acid-binding proteins are cytosolic proteins that bind longchain
fatty acids and promote transport to several organelles. Fatty
acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4; adipocyte FABP, A-FABP; or aP2) is
secreted from both macrophages and adipocytes and functions as an
adipokine [127]. An elevated FABP4 serum concentration is associated
with obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension [128]. Adipocytes
are the predominant contributors of circulating FABP4. During
lipolysis, FABP4 functions in a nonclassical secretion pathway [129].
Omega-3 PUFA dose-dependently reduced FABP4 secretion in 3T3-L1
adipocytes and reduced serum FABP4 concentrations in humans [130].
Omega-3-PUFA-mediated reductions in FABP4 could also be due in
part to reduced expression of transcription factors involved in
adipocyte differentiation, including PPARγ2 and C/EBPα [130].
Another possible mechanism by which FABP4 levels are lowered by
n-3 PUFA is through the β-adrenergic receptor [129] since n-3 PUFAs
reduce sympathetic nerve activity and thus may lower FABP4 serum
level [130]. Taken together, n-3 PUFAs modulate adipokine secretion
by exerting anti-inflammatory effects and promoting a metabolically
healthy phenotype.
6.4. Appetite suppression
In addition to leptin, central and peripheral peptides and hormones
involved in food intake and energy expenditure signaling pathways
are targets for n-3-PUFA-derived endocannabinoids and thus may be
implicated in the prevention and treatment of obesity. A subanalysis of
the study conducted by Thorsdottir et al. reported elevated sensations
of fullness in the participants who consumed higher n-3 PUFA content
meals (fatty fish and fish oil) compared to those who consumed lower
n-3 PUFA content meals (control and lean fish) both immediately and
2 h after consuming the meal. Feelings of hunger were consistently
lower in participants who ate the meal higher in n-3 PUFA content
[131]. Therefore, it is possible that increased feelings of satiety
following a meal high in n-3 PUFA content could aid weight loss by
reducing subsequent food intake. Appetite suppression could also be
mediated through FFAR4 (GPR 120). Omega-3 PUFAs are agonists for
FFAR4 [132], which elicits the secretion of cholecystokinin, a peptide
hormone that is synthesized and released from the small intestine and
has roles in hunger suppression [133].
6.5. Insulin resistance
Adipose tissue inflammation is at least in part responsible for
obesity-associated insulin resistance. Since n-3 PUFAs alleviate
adipose tissue inflammation as outlined above, reducing adipose
tissue inflammation is a possible mechanism for n-3-PUFA-associated
improvements in insulin sensitivity observed in animal models.
Hepatic insulin resistance in which both glucose production and
lipogenesis are increased is characteristic of the metabolic dysregulation
seen in obesity and T2DM. This dysregulation is attributed to
reductions in proximal insulin signaling kinases, such as P13K and
AKT, which hinder gluconeogenesis, as well as activation of mTORC1
and p70S6K, which control lipogenesis [134,135].
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, which is produced by the liver,
adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, has been shown to reduce both
hepatic glucose production and plasma glucose levels, while it also
increases insulin sensitivity and adipocyte glucose uptake [136].
Circulating FGF21 levels are elevated in diet-induced obese mice [137]
and obese and type 2 diabetic humans [138], suggesting obesityrelated
FGF21 resistance. Omega-3 PUFAs attenuate HF-diet-induced
increases in FGF21 [139] with associated reductions in hyperglycemia,
hypertriglyceridemia and plasma insulin levels [140,141]. This could
be a potential mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs improve insulin
resistance.
Omega-3 PUFA supplementation prevents insulin resistance in
muscle of rats fed an HF diet [142], partly by improving glycogen
synthesis [143]. Omega-3 PUFAs also decrease fat content in muscle
and maintain normal PI3K activity and expression and transcription of
GLUT 4 receptors in muscle and thus improve myotubule glucose
uptake. Omega-3 PUFAs also promote inhibition of hepatic glucose
production [142].

Hence, n-3 PUFAs may be a valuable nutritional tool for preventing
or diminishing muscular and hepatic insulin resistance associated
with obesity. However, n-3 PUFAs appear ineffective once T2DM is
established [144].
6.6. Lipid metabolism
In both animal and human studies of n-3 PUFA supplementation,
reductions in weight or fat mass were not accompanied by changes in
energy intake (Tables 1–4). Omega-3 PUFAs can partition dietary fuel
away from storage and toward oxidation by suppressing lipogenic
genes and activating genes that encode for mitochondrial and
peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in both the liver and muscle.
Given their cardioprotective properties, n-3 PUFAs can improve
endothelial function in patients with varying metabolic profiles [145],
possibly through increased production of nitric oxide [146]. Furthermore,
during exercise, fish oil has been shown to increase arterial
dilation and blood flow to skeletal muscle [147]. Hence, improved
blood flow may increase the delivery of fats to be utilized as energy in
skeletal muscle, especially during exercise.
Regulation of lipid metabolism may vary by n-3 PUFA type, as well
as by fat depot. For example, EPA is preferentially directed towards β-
oxidation, while DHA and DPA are spared from catabolism and
deposited in tissues [148]. Moreover, gene expression of fatty acid
synthase [149], hormone-sensitive lipase, lipoprotein lipase and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in retroperitoneal fat is decreased
with DHA and mixed EPA/DHA supplementation but not
with EPA supplementation alone [41].
Portions of hepatic TG are secreted via very low density lipoprotein
(VLDL), which delivers TG to peripheral tissues, such as WAT. Hepatic
VLDL secretion is enhanced in obese individuals [150] possibly due to
increased fatty acid delivery, elevated glucose and insulin concentrations,
as well as impaired fat oxidation, which increases fatty acid
esterification into TG [151]. Omega-3 PUFAs reduce lipogenesis and
reduce hepatic VLDL secretion [51]. In vitro, n-3-PUFA-treated HepG2
cells have decreased hepatic VLDL secretion [152] and reduced
apolipoprotein B100 production [153]. This has been validated in
both DHA- and n-3-PUFA-supplemented animals [154]. Hence,
through inhibition of VLDL formation, n-3 PUFAs could limit the
supply of fatty acids to adipocytes and thereby limit adipocyte size and
mass. In a deregulated system, n-3 PUFAs would also limit the amount
of fatty acids delivered to muscle and liver. Additionally, in animal
models, n-3 PUFAs modulate cholesteryl ester transfer protein
mediated exchanges, resulting in increased blood HDL cholesterol
and possibly apolipoprotein A-1 concentrations [155,156].
Omega-3 PUFAs alter expression and nuclear localization of both
the transcription factor sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1
(SREBP-1) and the carbohydrate response element binding protein
(ChREBP), which control several lipogeneic genes, including those
regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis [154,157]. Nuclear
translocation of ChREBP is inhibited by n-3 PUFAs and thus results in
reduced expression of lipogenic and glycolytic genes, including FAS
and pyruvate kinase respectively [158]. Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs
suppress hepatic lipogenesis by reducing both messenger RNA
(mRNA) and active protein expression of SREBP-1c, which results in
reduced expression of many genes involved in lipogenesis, including
FAS and acetyl-coA carboxylase [159–161]. Reduced SREBP-1c
expression, via n-3 PUFA, has been attributed to inhibited transcription
of nascent precursor SREBP-1c, accelerated transcript decay and
reduced levels of the mature cleaved form of SREBP-1c [159,160],
possibly through inhibition of proteolytic processing and reduced
feed-forward activation of the Srebf1 gene. This inhibition could be
due to interference with insulin signaling pathways, which promotes
the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1c, potentially via an AKTdependent
mechanism [162,163].
The role of liver X receptor (LXR) is controversial. In vivo, EPA
suppression of SREBP-1c promoter activity is dependent upon an
intact SRE but not LXR response elements, suggesting that decreased
transcription of nascent SREBP-1c with n-3 PUFA treatment results
from decreased availability and thus reduced feed-forward activation
[163]. In contrast, others indicate a role in the inhibition of LXRα in
reduced SREBP-1c expression with n-3 PUFA, but this may be
dependent upon cell types [164]. Accelerated degradation of SREBP-
1c mRNA has also been proposed as a mechanism for reduced SREBP-
1c expression [165]. Omega-3 PUFAs inhibit SREBP-1c cleavage
processing, but the cleavage sites are unknown [166].
Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by n-3 PUFA can also
suppress SREBP-1c cleavage and nuclear translocation, perhaps via
serine phosphorylation and/or by blocking activation of the insulinresponsive
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/
S6K-signaling pathway [167]. SREBP-1c synthesis, transport and
maturation are increased with insulin [162].
PUFAs, prostaglandins and leukotrienes can all act as ligands for
PPARs. PPARs are transcription factors that form heterodimers with
retinoid X receptors in the promoter regions of several genes involved
in lipid and glucose metabolism [168,169]. For example, n-3 PUFA
activation of PPARα decreases lipogenesis by suppressing FAS activity
[161,170]. However, lipogenesis suppression by n-3 PUFA does not
require PPARα activation [171].
PPARγ acts as a master regulator of adipogenesis and controls
several genes and adipokines in lipid and glucose metabolism. Omega-
3 PUFAs act as ligands for PPARγ and modulate several PPARγ target
genes in mice [172] and 3T3-L1 adipocytes [97]. Omega-3 PUFAs
enhance PPARγ binding to PPAR-response element in the promoter
region of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which promotes
adipogenesis and alleviates hypoxia-induced adipocyte inflammation
and insulin resistance [173]. It has been suggested that PPARγ plays a
significant role in the ability of n-3 PUFA, specifically DHA, to stimulate
M2 macrophage polarization and thereby reduce inflammation since
these results are not seen in PPARγ knockdown RAW264.7 cells [174].
Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to increase mitochondrial
biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver [175,176], adipose tissue
[43] and small intestine [177] of rodents, possibly through PPARα and
Cox3 induction [175,178,179]. PUFA-controlled genes involved in lipid
oxidation and thermogenesis include mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase
[180], peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase [64,181], hepatic CPT-1
[154], FABP [127] and fatty acid transporter proteins [182].
Activation of PPARα can also increase fatty acid oxidation.
Increases in fatty acid oxidation by n-3 PUFA may also be mediated
by AMPK, a known regulator of cellular energy metabolism. AMPK upregulation
by n-3 PUFA has been demonstrated in both adipose tissue
and cultured adipocytes [55].
Taken together, n-3 PUFAs regulate lipid metabolism, favoring fatty
acid oxidation and suppression of lipogenesis and leading to a
favorable lipid profile and adipocyte metabolism.
6.7. Thermogenesis
Many have examined cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis
mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in the
presence of n-3 PUFA [43,48,54]. UCPs are inner mitochondrial
proteins that function to transport hydrogen ions across the
mitochondrial inner membrane. We have recently shown that BAT
from EPA-supplemented mice expresses higher levels of thermogenic
genes, such as PRDM16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma
coactivator-1alpha and UCP1 [183].
Omega-3 PUFAs increase mitochondrial oxidative capacity in WAT
[43] and skeletal muscle, possibly through UCP-3 up-regulation [48], but
not in BAT or liver [43].However, because most studies were carried out at
20°C, it is unclear whether increases in mitochondrial oxidative capacity
K. Albracht-Schulte et al. / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 58 (2018) 1–16 11
are n-3 PUFA mediated or cold induced. Janovska et al. reported no
differences in body weight but decreased epididymal fat mass after
feeding an HF diet supplemented with n-3 PUFA in mice kept at 30°C,
indicating that n-3 PUFA could attenuate body fat accumulation even at
thermoneutrality and independent of cold-induced thermogenesis [52].
Mechanisms underlying the role of n-3 PUFA in possible induction of
energy expenditure and prevention of body fat accumulation should be
investigated further at various temperatures since thermogenic markers
are activated even at 22°C [183].
6.8. Lean mass
The mechanismby which n-3 PUFAs have the potential to increase
lean mass is not fully understood but likely involves both catabolic and
anabolic pathways. Increased lean mass would result in improved
body composition and possibly improved metabolism. Even though
increases in RMR have been demonstrated with increases in lean mass
[184], post-n-3 PUFA supplementation increases in lean mass are not
always accompanied by increases in RMR [66]. Future studies are
needed to examine the relationship between n-3 PUFA changes in lean
mass in relation to RMR since metabolic rate significantly influences
body weight.
Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to attenuate muscle protein
breakdown in isolated muscles of mice [185]. Increases in protein
synthesis may be mediated by n-3 PUFA activation of the mTORp70s6k
signaling pathway [186], a key pathway in muscle cell growth.
Similarly, Clark et al. reported increased whole-body protein turnover
under insulin stimulation but did not see significant increases in lean
mass following 9 months of n-3 PUFA supplementation [187].
Certainly, changes in protein dynamics may not translate to increases
in protein mass.
One possible mechanism of n-3 PUFA in increasing lean mass is the
alteration of protein dynamics related to n-3 PUFA anti-inflammatory
properties [66] since proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α can increase
protein degradation via ATP-ubiquitin-dependent pathways [188].
Another such potential mechanism relates to the ability of n-3
PUFA to lower cortisol levels [189]. Noreen et al. reported decreases in
cortisol with n-3 PUFA supplementation but noted a significant
correlation between cortisol level and changes in body composition
[66]. Others have shown that a reduction in fat mass does not lower
cortisol production [190]. Hence, n-3 PUFA supplementation may
modulate cortisol levels so as to improve body composition [66].
Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 have been
shown to increase blood levels of cortisol [191], which increases
protein catabolism [192]. Hence, anti-inflammatory properties of n-3
PUFA could aid in disrupting this pathway. However, increased muscle
protein synthesis with n-3 PUFA supplementation is not likely
mediated by changes in inflammation in a healthy population [186].
Further investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by
which n-3 PUFAs alter protein dynamics to increase lean mass.
6.9. Epigenetics and microRNA
Epigenetics may be an important contributor to many chronic
diseases, including obesity [193,194]. Limited studies have examined
n-3 PUFA and epigenetic modifications even though the expression of
several genes involved in metabolic homeostasis is regulated by DNA
methylation. The few that have been conducted report conflicting
evidence for DNA methylation and n-3 PUFA. In a population-based
study, n-3 PUFA intake was associated withDNAmethylation in Alaska
Yup’ik people [195]. A few studies have reported that fish oil
supplementation did not alter the methylation pattern of genes
[196,197], including leptin and the leptin receptor, in mouse
epididymal fat [196]. It may be that n-3 PUFAs work through
epigenetic mechanisms other than methylation [197]. In dietinduced
obese mice, leptin expression may be regulated by n-3
PUFA via changes in methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 and
histone modifications [198]. Since an HF diet has been shown to cause
changes in the methylation of gene-specific promoter regions in the
liver [199] and WAT [200], the influence of n-3 PUFAs on epigenetic
modifications warrants further investigation.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that act as
posttranscriptional regulators of genes by acting as sequencespecific
inhibitors of mRNA. These miRNAs target transcription factors
to indirectly affect entire signaling pathways. It has been documented
that miRNAs act as key regulators in the pathogenesis of metabolic
disease by affecting inflammation [201] and lipid metabolism [202].
Recent studies have shown n-3 PUFA to modulate miRNA
expression [201,203,204]. A diet enriched in PUFA correlated to
changes in circulating miRNAs, specifically miR-106a, along with
changes in other miRNAs related to lipid metabolism and adipokine
secretion in healthy women [203]. In animal models, n-3 PUFAs
suppress inflammation through down-regulation of miR-19b-3p,
-146b-5p and -183-5p by targeting toll-like receptor, NOD-like
receptor, RIG-I-like receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinase and
transforming growth factor-β pathways [201]. In obese rats, DHA has
been shown to counteract obesity-related increases in hepatic miR-
33a and miR-122, thus improving lipid metabolism via decreased
SREBP2 and FAS expression, respectively [204]. Therefore, fully
characterizing n-3 PUFA modulation of miRNA involved in key
pathways, such as lipid metabolism and inflammation, is warranted
and could play a key role in targeting MetS and obesity-related
therapies.
7. Future perspectives
Both animal and human studies have examined the beneficial
effects of combining n-3 PUFA with other dietary supplements and
pharmaceuticals including antidiabetic drugs, L-alanyl-L-glutamine
[205], as well as α-lipoic acid [118] and krill oil [206]. Animal studies
using the combination of n-3 PUFA and rosiglitazone have reported
significantly greater reductions in body weight [63,143], enhanced
oxidation of fatty acids [207] and counteraction of lipogenesis than
with rosiglitazone therapy alone [63]. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation
in addition to antidiabetic pharmaceuticals could attenuate body
weight gain caused by pharmaceuticals and should be further
investigated [208].
8. Conclusions
The management of obesity has shifted from a narrow focus on BMI
to the wider field that includes the complications of obesity, with the
goal to reduce obesity-associated comorbidities [209]. While n-3
PUFAs have not yet shown consistent benefits in terms of weight loss
in humans, improvements in the metabolic profile of obese individuals
have been demonstrated. Therefore, n-3 PUFAs may be an important
adjunct to obesity management along with lifestyle modification and
pharmacotherapy. Further study of the genetic and epigenetic
molecular targets related to metabolism, appetite and energetics
could aid the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for obesityassociated
metabolic disorders.

Abstract
Strategies to reduce obesity have become public health priorities as the prevalence of obesity has risen in the United States and around the world. While the
anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are well known, their antiobesity effects
and efficacy against metabolic syndrome, especially in humans, are still under debate. In animal models, evidence consistently suggests a role for n-3 PUFAs in
reducing fat mass, particularly in the retroperitoneal and epididymal regions. In humans, however, published research suggests that though n-3 PUFAs may not
aid weight loss, they may attenuate further weight gain and could be useful in the diet or as a supplement to help maintain weight loss. Proposed mechanisms by
which n-3 PUFAs may work to improve body composition and counteract obesity-related metabolic changes include modulating lipid metabolism; regulating
adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin; alleviating adipose tissue inflammation; promoting adipogenesis and altering epigenetic mechanisms.

1. Introduction
The American Medical Association recognizes obesity as a disease
[1] and considers it a major public health problem. In the United States,
36.5% of adults are obese [2], while approximately 39% of the world’s
adult population is overweight and more than 13% are obese [3].
Obesity increases morbidity risks for heart disease, type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) and some types of cancer [4]. Metabolic changes
associated with these diseases comprise metabolic syndrome (MetS),
which is diagnosed when three of the following five conditions exist:
abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides (TG), reduced high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, high blood pressure and elevated
fasting blood glucose [5].
Lipids are key macronutrients in the human diet. The type and
proportion of dietary fatty acids consumed impact health and wholebody
physiology [6]. Research has shown that saturated fatty acids
(SFAs) are detrimental to health, while monounsaturated (MUFAs)
and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) offer health benefits [7]. In
the diet, fatty fish and fish oil rich in omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs, such as
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have
demonstrated cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic
properties. Hence, these fatty acids may assist in the
treatment and prevention of obesity comorbidities, especially by
improving individual components of the metabolic syndrome [7–9].
Therefore, the effect of n-3 PUFAs on body weight and body
composition is of particular interest.
In this review, we provide an update on the effects of n-3 PUFAs on
obesity and MetS in both animal and human studies, highlighting
potential mechanisms for n-3 PUFAs in reducing body weight,
improving body composition and counteracting the adverse metabolic
consequences of obesity.
2. Adipose tissue and obesity
Body fat is primarily stored in adipose tissue, a connective tissue
composed of adipocytes, preadipoctyes, vascular endothelial cells,
fibroblasts and various types of immune cells, including adipose tissue
macrophages [10]. Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that
secretes numerous hormones, including leptin and adiponectin, and
cytokines (adipokines) such as interleukin (IL)-6 [11]. Three major
types of adipose tissue have been identified: white adipose tissue
(WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige (“brite”) adipose tissue.
WAT is primarily responsible for energy storage in the form of TG and
the release of fatty acids during periods of fasting; it is mainly located
in two distinct depots, as subcutaneous adipose tissue or visceral
adipose tissue [10]. The adipocytes of visceral fat surrounding internal
organs are more metabolically active than those of subcutaneous
adipose tissue and thus contribute to the risks of cardiovascular
disease and T2DM [12]. BAT plays a key role in thermogenesis and is
mainly found above the clavicle and scapula in adults [12]. Obesity
leads to adipose tissue dysfunction, which is mechanistically linked to
the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the liver and in skeletal
muscle (Fig. 1) and may result in MetS [13].
While weight loss via lifestyle modification is the primary
treatment in the management of obesity and its comorbidities,
compliance is difficult. Adjunct treatments for the management of
obesity include pharmaceuticals [14], surgery [15] and dietary
supplements [16]. Despite these measures, however, the prevalence
of obesity has continued to rise. Thus, alternative strategies to assist in
weight loss and reduce body fat are necessary. Natural bioactives such
as n-3 PUFAs present few side effects and so may be safer than other
modalities for the treatment of obesity. This review summarizes
current basic and clinical research and mechanistic insights regarding
the effects of n-3 PUFAs on obesity.
3. Omega-3 fatty acids
3.1. Synthesis and metabolism
The human body can synthesize many fatty acids, but not linoleic
acid (LA; omega-6; C18:2 n-6) or α-linolenic acid (ALA; C18:3 n-3),
which must be consumed in the diet. ALA is the precursor for EPA
(C20:5 n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; C22:5 n-3) and DHA (C22:6
n-3) in the human body (Fig. 2) [6]. Many studies have found low
conversion rates of ALA to EPA and DPA, and little to no DHA synthesis
[17,18]; hence, any direct benefits of these very long chain fatty acids
depend on dietary intake [17]. Both dietary intake and fatty acid
desaturase activity determine plasma n-3 PUFA levels [19]. A balanced
n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio (1:1 to 2:1 is optimal) is important for
homeostasis and normal development throughout the lifespan. High
n-6 PUFA intake in the Western diet increases the n-6:n-3 ratio to a
range from 10:1 to 20:1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of
obesity and related diseases [19,20].
3.2. Sources of omega-3 PUFAs
Dietary sources of n-3 PUFAs are much less abundant than n-6
PUFAs. ALA is synthesized by plants from LA and can thus be found in
green leafy vegetables, seeds such as flaxseed (linseed), nuts and
legumes. Vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, perilla, canola and
soybean also provide ALA but are much more abundant in LA. Fish,
such as salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, anchovy, bluefish, herring,

Fig. 1. Adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle cross talk in obesity and insulin resistance. The liver maintains normoglycemia during fasting via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
Following a meal, increased glucose delivery to the pancreas stimulates insulin secretion, which acts on the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The primary action of insulin on the
liver is to suppress hepatic glucose output, while insulin increases glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin additionally inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue. In
obesity, changes in adipokines produced and released from adipose tissue, such as decreased adiponectin and increased TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines, coupled with
increased free fatty acids contribute to hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance.

essential n-3 PUFA that is metabolized to EPA, DPA and DHA. Eicosanoids derived from the metabolism of EPA, DPA andDHAalso aid in the regulation of inflammation and are considered
more anti-inflammatory. ISOPS, isoprostanes; COX, cyclooxygenases; LOX, lipooxygenases.

mullet, sturgeon and sardines, are also rich sources of n-3 PUFAs,
particularly EPA and DHA. Lean fish, such as cod, store lipids in their
liver, and for this reason, cod liver oil is a good source of n-3 PUFAs.
Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna, store lipids
throughout their bodies and are good whole sources of n-3 PUFAs [6].
The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming
about 8 oz per week of seafood, which would provide about 250 mg/
day of EPA and DHA [21]. The recommended intake for n-3 PUFAs
corresponds to consuming fish twice weekly, including one serving of
oily fish. Even though there is ample evidence for a role of n-3 PUFAs in
modulating chronic diseases, an optimal dose has not been agreed
upon, and recommendations vary based on governing body. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has stated that levels up to 3 g/day are
generally recognized as safe [22], although other authorities have
reported no adverse effects at up to 5–6 g/day [23]. It has been
suggested that the bioavailability of n-3 PUFAs is improved by
emulsification. Emulsified n-3 PUFA is more easily exposed to
pancreatic lipase and colipase, enhancing its digestion. Additionally,
emulsified n-3 PUFA is easily transported into enterocytes, thus
increasing fatty acid absorption [24,25].
3.3. Dietary omega-3 PUFA intake, obesity and metabolic disorders
Dietary fish intake is considerably higher in people of the
circumpolar arctic regions and relatively much lower in those living
in the United States, Australia, France and the United Kingdom. Fish
intake closely reflects n-3 PUFA consumption, with intakes of
approximately 3 to 4 g/day by Eskimos, 5 to 6 g/day by Japanese,
0.189 g/day by Australians and 0.25 g/day by Europeans and North
Americans [26,27]. After it was reported that Japanese and Eskimo
populations had healthier metabolic profiles associated with elevated
plasma n-3 PUFA levels attributed to high fatty fish intake [28], many
prospective studies began to examine whether fish or fish oil intake
prevents the development of obesity.
The Health Professional Follow-up Study suggested that men with
a high level of fish consumption were less likely to be overweight [29].
In contrast, the Nurses’ Health Study found that women with higher
fish intake (two or more fish meals per week) had a higher risk of
being overweight [30]. In China, data from the Shanghai Women’s and
Men’s Health studies found similar indices of body mass among groups
of varying fish intake [31]. Clearly, findings of prospective studies
regarding the beneficial effects of fish intake on obesity are far from
agreement. The evident discrepancies may have arisen due to differing
or inadequate methods of data collection on fish intake (food
frequency questionnaires), differences in cooking methods and
other unaccounted for lifestyle practices (exercise, etc.) from study
to study and among different study populations.
Plasma, erythrocyte and tissue n-3 PUFA concentrations are largely
determined by consumption and thus may be taken to accurately
reflect n-3 PUFA consumption. Plasma levels of fatty acids reflect
recent intake, whereas tissue levels of fatty acids reflect long-term
intake [32,33]. Erythrocyte fatty acid content (i.e., the omega-3 index)
correlates with fatty acid intake and parallels tissue concentrations
and thus is more reflective of long-term intake [34]. An increase in n-
6:n-3 ratio [35] and overall lower serum phospholipid n-3 concentrations,
particularly of DHA have been associated with obesity,
specifically waist circumference measures [36] in obese adolescents
[35] and obese adults [36]. Thus, prospective studies on the
relationship between plasma and erythrocyte fatty acid content and
the long-term risk of obesity are warranted to clarify this issue.
4. Omega-3 PUFA in animal studies
Animal studies performed to investigate the antiobesity effects of
n-3 PUFA have used a variety of models, diet compositions, and n-3
PUFA compositions and doses. Such differences across experimental
designs complicate the interpretation of their results into cohesive and
conclusive findings (Table 1).
4.1. Omega-3 PUFA, energy intake and obesity
Studies relating effects on body weight and energy intake with n-3
PUFA supplementation are inconsistent; while some show either
decreased [37,38] or increased energy intake [39], most show
unchanged energy intake with the addition of n-3 PUFA or with
varying n-3 PUFA doses [40–57]. Only one study performed with
female mice reported decreased energy intake with no significant
effect on body weight [38].
Supplementation with n-3 PUFA prevented high-fat (HF)-dietinduced
weight gain in a number of rodent studies, most of which
supplemented an HF diet provided from the start, concurrent with
inducing obesity [41,43,45,48,49,51]. Several studies have utilized a
design that investigated the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA to reverse dietinduced
weight gain and related metabolic changes by adding n-3
PUFA to the HF diet at approximately midstudy [46,47,58,59]. Our lab
found that mice on an EPA reversal diet (6 weeks of HF followed by 5
weeks of HF-EPA) had body weights similar to mice fed the HF-only
diet [47]. In a different study, body weight decreased significantly at
the beginning of the 6-week reversal period, returning to weights
similar to the low-fat-fed group for the remainder of the study (18
weeks total) [58]. Taken together, these studies suggest that
antiobesity effects of N-3 PUFA in mice are predominantly seen
when it is fed from the start rather than introduced after obesity is
already established.
4.2. Omega-3 PUFA and insulin resistance
Obesity leads to insulin resistance, which is at least in part
responsible for the pathogenesis of MetS [13]. Most weight loss
interventions improve insulin resistance. Similarly,most animal studies
document a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on insulin sensitivity [60].
Since n-3 PUFAs induce weight loss in rodent models of obesity, it is
difficult to statewhether there are direct effects of n-3 PUFAs on insulin
sensitivity. By contrast,we have shownweight-independent benefits of
EPA on insulin sensitivity in HF-diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice.
These EPA-fed mice had significantly improved homeostatic model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores when compared to
HF-fed mice, despite similar body weights [47].
4.3. Animal study conclusions
Thus far, most rodent studies have shown an antiobesity effect of n-
3 PUFA, while fewer studies have found no change in body weight
[37,39–41,44–46,49,51–57,59,61,62]. These studies do suggest that n-
3 PUFA plays a role in reducing adipose tissue mass [40], particularly in
the epididymal [39,42,43,46,49,52,53,56,57,61–64] and retroperitoneal
locations [37,39,41,46,49,57]. Differences in the outcomes of
studies on the effects of n-3 PUFA on body weight could be due to
differing animal models of obesity (genetic vs. diet-induced obesity),
the content of the diet (HF vs. high sucrose), the n-3 PUFA (EPA or
DHA) formulation, the form of n-3 PUFA (TG form or as ethyl ester)
provided or various combinations of these factors. Differences in n-3
PUFA dosage and duration may contribute to differences in outcomes
as well. Failure to assess energy expenditure also limits meaningful
comparisons. The combination of calorie restriction and n-3 PUFA
supplementation may be the most effective strategy for reducing
weight and improving body composition [54]. Interestingly, Ruzickova
et al. extrapolated findings from their animal study to humans to
suggest that with a daily intake of 100 g dietary fat, 11 g of EPA/DHA
would be required to limit weight gain [42]. Few animal studies have

considered translation to human studies since the amounts of n-3
PUFA, as EPA, DHA or both, in animal studies far exceed amounts
feasible in humans [42,45,64]. It should be noted, however, that
human studies of fish oil intake among Eskimo and Japanese
populations have shown beneficial effects of these fatty acids even
at intake levels below 11 g/day. Since these populations consume
more fish and less red meat, it is plausible that a relatively lower
arachidonic acid (AA) intake leading to a decreased n-6:n-3 ratio is
contributing to the beneficial effects observed.
5. Omega-3 PUFA and weight loss in humans
There are a variety of approaches to investigating the effects of n-3

interventions that use different types of fish and varying levels of fish
oil content, particularly EPA and DHA (Table 2). Fish and fish oil have
also been used in addition to a variety of weight loss and dietary
interventions of different durations with or without an exercise
regimen. Participants have ranged from healthy to obese, with a
variety of obesity-associated disorders, including T2DM, hyperinsulinemia
and other features of MetS. The control, or type of placebo,
which consists of assorted oils containing n-6 PUFA, such as sunflower,
corn, soybean and paraffin oils, also varies among studies.
With n-3 PUFA supplementation alone, studies report no change in
body weight (Table 2). One study in healthy adults supplemented with
fish oil diets demonstrated decreased body fat mass, basal respiratory
quotient and increased basal lipid oxidation when dietary intake was
controlled [65]. Another study found reduction in fat mass along with
significantly increased lean mass (fat-free mass) despite no alterations
in total body mass, resting metabolic rate (RMR) or respiratory
exchange ratio when compared to placebo supplementation [66].
Participant-reported diet diaries indicate significant reductions in
carbohydrate, fat and total caloric intake with n-3 PUFA supplementation
in one study [67], but others show no change in energy intake
[68–71]. Since most studies only report total caloric intake, the effect
of n-3 PUFA supplementation on macronutrient and energy intake
should be repeated in larger studies to conclusively determine the role
of n-3 PUFA in weight loss in humans.
5.1. Omega-3 PUFA in combination with dietary interventions
Weight loss results appear more promising when n-3 PUFA
supplementation is combined with calorie restriction (Table 3), but
it is difficult to draw conclusions due to the variety of calorie
restriction programs in different studies. Greater improvements in
metabolic parameters, such as improved insulin resistance and
decreased TGs, were attained with combined n-3 PUFA supplementation
and calorie restriction compared to calorie restriction alone
[72–74] or replacement of SFA [71]. Interestingly, results appear to be
independent of the source, form or dose, i.e., different fish species
(salmon, tuna, sardines, etc.) or fish oil capsules, of n-3 PUFA supplied
[72,73,75]. This was confirmed by Thorsdottir et al., who compared the
effects of various fish (cod or salmon) and fish oil (DHA/EPA capsules)
in conjunction with 30% calorie restriction on weight loss in young,
overweight adults for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks, men receiving cod,
salmon or fish oil capsules lost approximately 1 kg more than those on
30% calorie restriction alone. The fish species and fish oil capsules
supplied various amounts of n-3 PUFA: 0.3 g/day from cod, 3.0 g/day
from salmon and 1.5 g/day from fish oil capsules, yet the n-3 PUFA
dose did not influence weight loss outcomes. This suggests that
variations in weight loss benefits may not depend solely on variations
in n-3 PUFA dosages from study to study [76].
Rapid weight loss, induced by a very low calorie diet, alters adipose
tissue and serum fatty acid composition [77,78]. Supplementation
with n-3 PUFA during rapid weight loss increases serum n-3 PUFA
concentrations [79] and may help prevent unfavorable changes in
fatty acid tissue composition and essential fatty acid deficiency [77].
Some studies have utilized n-3 PUFA supplementation prior to a
weight loss intervention, such as dietary restriction and/or an exercise
regimen, and reported significant reductions in weight [80], while
others observed no changes in body mass index (BMI) or body
composition, particularly in insulin-resistant individuals [81]. Nonetheless,
this type of study design should be refined and pursued
further due to the relationship between tissue/plasma/erythrocyte n-
3 PUFA concentrations and obesity. It will be important to verify if
increasing n-3 PUFA concentrations prior to interventions would aid in
weight loss and ameliorate obesity related metabolic dysfunctions.

5.2. Omega-3 PUFA and exercise
Others have explored the influence of n-3 PUFA in conjunction
with exercise and with or without a dietary intervention to determine
if the addition of n-3 PUFA leads to greater weight loss (Table 4). With
the addition of n-3 PUFA to an exercise regimen and dietary
intervention, only one study has shown a decrease in body weight
[82]. However, only a few such studies have been conducted, and the
dietary intervention consisted of nutritional counseling rather than a
prescribed diet [83,84].
The combined effects of n-3 PUFA and exercise are currently
unknown. Well-designed placebo-controlled randomized clinical
trials are lacking [85], as they require healthy and lean participants
[86]. Differences in the intensity and forms of exercise (i.e., aerobic or
resistance training) employed prevent valid comparisons across
studies. The addition of n-3 PUFA to aerobic training without dietary
intervention has resulted in decreases in fat mass [87]. Furthermore,
the addition of n-3 PUFA to resistance training without dietary
intervention resulted in increases in lean mass [88] and improved
muscle quality [89].
5.3. Limitations in human studies
Overall, findings on the effects of n-3 PUFA in humans are
inconclusive. Improvements in study design and analyses could help
resolve apparent inconsistencies in the effects of n-3 PUFA on weight
and body composition. For example, sex, metabolic phenotype and
geographic location should be taken into consideration in addition to
n-3 PUFA supplementation. There is also a case for evaluating
translation to real-world weight-loss diets, which are complicated
by the need to control for eating behavior and physical activity. Even
when participants are supplied with food, outpatient studies are
difficult to translate because measurements of adherence to the
recommended interventions [90] generally rely on self-reporting.
Hence, studies using inpatient feeding and analysis of energy
utilization should be carried out [91].
Failure to assess energy expenditure in human studies limits our
understanding of the associations between n-3 PUFA status and
decreased adiposity, weight loss and energy balance, especially when
energy intake is unchanged. This highlights the need for tightly
controlled studies, similar to that of Hall et al., to validate fuel
partitioning and n-3 PUFA influence on metabolism in humans.
Unfortunately, work of this nature is expensive, labor intensive and
generally of short duration with small sample sizes [91].
Other limitations on current human studies of n-3 PUFA supplementation
include the use of less reliable anthropometric methods
[92] and failure to dose according to body weight to meet the
threshold of tissue membrane n-3 PUFA phospholipid enrichment
[93]. Finally, it is of utmost importance to utilize a standardized
method, such as the omega-3 index, to assess n-3 PUFA status, the

biological effects of n-3 PUFA and n-3 PUFA related metabolites [34].
Future human studies should employ this method to verify that n-3
PUFA consumption parallels n-3 PUFA concentrations in the body.
6. Mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA improve adiposity and
metabolic disorders
There are several proposed mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA could
work in reducing body weight and improving the metabolic profile
(Fig. 3). These include alterations in adipose tissue gene expression;
changes in adipokine release; adipokine-mediated or adipokinerelated
pathways; appetite suppression; alterations in carbohydrate
metabolism; increases in fat oxidation; increases in energy expenditure
(possibly through thermogenesis); activating mechanisms
involved in muscle anabolism; and, lastly, influence on epigenetics.
6.1. Omega-3 PUFA and adipogenesis
Adipose tissue expansion in obesity occurs via adipocyte hypertrophy
(enlargement of adipocytes) and hyperplasia (increase in
adipocyte number due to adipogenesis). The latter is associated with
smaller adipocyte size and a metabolically healthy phenotype. Both n-
3 and n-6 PUFAs can bind and/or regulate transcriptional factors that
control genes involved in preadipocyte differentiation. PUFAs,
particularly AA and its metabolites, serve as ligands for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) gamma (PPARγ) and delta
(PPARδ) to induce fat cell differentiation and accelerate maturation by
elevating lipoprotein lipase expression in vitro [94,95]. Elevated
concentrations of n-6 and n-3 PUFA in human subcutaneous tissue
correlate with reduced adipocyte size; increased SFA concentrations
lead to increased fat cell size [96]. Differences in fatty acid
concentrations are more strongly associated with abdominal subcutaneous
than visceral adipose tissue [35].
Studies performed in clonal adipocytes (3T3-L1) also demonstrate
up-regulation in PPARγ expression, adipogenesis and lipid droplet
formation after the addition of n-3 PUFA [43,97]. Taken together, these
studies suggest that n-3 PUFAs promote adipogenesis and a healthy
expansion of adipose tissue during positive energy balance, promoting
a metabolically healthy phenotype.
6.2. Adipose tissue inflammation
Chronic low-grade inflammation and changes in adipokine
patterns are key factors in the pathogenesis of metabolic derangements
in obesity (Fig. 1). Indeed, a relationship exists between BMI,
body fat percentage and inflammatory markers [98]. Omega-3 PUFAs
inhibit nuclear transcription factor kappa B, a key transcription factor
in cytokine gene expression and inflammation [99]. In humans and in
vitro, n-3 PUFAs also have a documented role in reducing cytokines,
including IL-1 [100,101], IL-6 [102] and TNF-α [100,103], which are all
elevated in obesity. (For an extensive review of mechanisms of n-3
PUFA and adipose tissue inflammation, see Kalupahana et al., 2011).
Omega-3 PUFAs act as agonists for different members of the free
fatty acid receptor family (FFARs) present on a variety of cell types
involved in both energy homeostasis and the inflammatory response.
A number of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids can
activate FFAR1 and FFAR4 [104,105]. Agonist stimulation that impedes
the inflammatory response occurs through activation of the Gprotein-
independent signaling pathway through interaction with β-
arrestin proteins, which may further interact with the transforming
growth factor kinase protein (TAK1) and binding protein (TAB-1).
Stimulation of FFAR4 or β-arrestin inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
mediated release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6
in the macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7. In fact, decreased
macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue has been shown in mice
fed an n-3-PUFA-enriched diet, possibly via activation of FFAR4 (Gprotein-
coupled receptor 120). Since n-3 PUFAs are unable to reduce
Fig. 3. Mechanisms mediating effects of n-3 PUFA on liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle metabolism. Omega-3 PUFAs increase fatty acid oxidation in the liver, adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle, thus limiting fat storage in these tissues. Omega-3 PUFAs also decrease the production and release of proinflammatory adipokines. In skeletal muscle, n-3 PUFAs
promote protein synthesis. All mechanisms depicted here contribute to an improved metabolic profile.
K. Albracht-Schulte et al. / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 58 (2018) 1–16 9
adipose tissue macrophage infiltration in FFAR4 knockout mice, this
highlights the mechanistic importance of FFAR4 in mediating the antiinflammatory
effects of n-3 PUFA [106]. Furthermore, fish oil
supplementation (4 g n-3 PUFA/day) in obese humans has been
associated with decreased M1 macrophage presence in adipose tissue
and subsequent decreases in proinflammatory markers, such as IL-8
[107]. Accordingly, monocytes differentiate preferentially into M1
macrophages when treated with human postprandial triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins following a meal rich in saturated fatty acids, versus a
meal high in MUFA or PUFA, after which they shift towards M2
macrophages [108].
Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs halt inflammatory processes by inhibiting
activation of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domainlike
receptor; NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome
via an arrestin-FFAR4-dependent pathway [109], which triggers a
caspase-dependent cascade, resulting in the release of proinflammatory
cytokines [110]. The n-3 PUFA DHA acts through FFAR1 or FFAR4
to suppress caspase-1 activity via formation of a β-arrestin-2/NLRP3 or
NLRP1b complex and thus decrease the release of proinflammatory
cytokines [109].
Omega-3 PUFAs also influence lipid rafts, which are cholesteroland
sphingolipid-rich areas of the plasma membrane [111] that can
form signaling platforms [112,113]. Incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into
plasma membranes disrupts lipid rafts [114] and hence could mediate
anti-inflammatory and antichemotactic n-3 PUFA properties.
6.3. Adipokine secretion
Several studies have shown that n-3 PUFAs modulate adipokine
secretion. Obese individuals have high plasma leptin levels [115]
suggestive of leptin resistance. Conversely, weight loss leads to
parallel decreases in plasma leptin levels [116]. This weight-lossassociated
decrease in leptin could contribute to hunger and a lower
metabolic rate and ultimately lead to weight regain [117]. EPA
supplementation attenuates the decrease in blood leptin levels that
occurs during weight loss in obese women, suggesting a potentially
significant role of EPA in weight loss maintenance [118]. Indeed, EPA
increases the production of leptin in rodents and cultured adipocytes
[37,119], suggesting a direct effect of n-3 PUFA on leptin production.
However, the few studies that have assessed the role of n-3 PUFA in
weight maintenance have found no significant effect on weight or
blood leptin concentrations between n-3-PUFA-supplemented subjects
compared to other weight loss groups [120,121]. Omega-3-PUFAmediated
effects on leptin are dependent on a number of factors, such
as diet composition and energy balance, which could cause conflicting
results.
Independent of body weight, both animal [37,48,122] and human
[123,124] studies have found significant increases in blood levels of
the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin, following n-3 PUFA
consumption. EPA appears to regulate adiponectin levels at the
translational or posttranslational level rather than at the transcriptional
level [123]. It has been proposed that the anti-inflammatory
properties of n-3 PUFA supplementation induce an increase in
adipocyte adiponectin production [123] and improve leptin sensitivity
[125]. This type of interplay could have a significant influence on body
weight regulation. An inverse relationship between serum adiponectin
concentrations and TNF-α has also been demonstrated in ob/ob
mice [123] and in overweight and insulin-resistant children following
n-3 PUFA supplementation [126].
Fatty acid-binding proteins are cytosolic proteins that bind longchain
fatty acids and promote transport to several organelles. Fatty
acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4; adipocyte FABP, A-FABP; or aP2) is
secreted from both macrophages and adipocytes and functions as an
adipokine [127]. An elevated FABP4 serum concentration is associated
with obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension [128]. Adipocytes
are the predominant contributors of circulating FABP4. During
lipolysis, FABP4 functions in a nonclassical secretion pathway [129].
Omega-3 PUFA dose-dependently reduced FABP4 secretion in 3T3-L1
adipocytes and reduced serum FABP4 concentrations in humans [130].
Omega-3-PUFA-mediated reductions in FABP4 could also be due in
part to reduced expression of transcription factors involved in
adipocyte differentiation, including PPARγ2 and C/EBPα [130].
Another possible mechanism by which FABP4 levels are lowered by
n-3 PUFA is through the β-adrenergic receptor [129] since n-3 PUFAs
reduce sympathetic nerve activity and thus may lower FABP4 serum
level [130]. Taken together, n-3 PUFAs modulate adipokine secretion
by exerting anti-inflammatory effects and promoting a metabolically
healthy phenotype.
6.4. Appetite suppression
In addition to leptin, central and peripheral peptides and hormones
involved in food intake and energy expenditure signaling pathways
are targets for n-3-PUFA-derived endocannabinoids and thus may be
implicated in the prevention and treatment of obesity. A subanalysis of
the study conducted by Thorsdottir et al. reported elevated sensations
of fullness in the participants who consumed higher n-3 PUFA content
meals (fatty fish and fish oil) compared to those who consumed lower
n-3 PUFA content meals (control and lean fish) both immediately and
2 h after consuming the meal. Feelings of hunger were consistently
lower in participants who ate the meal higher in n-3 PUFA content
[131]. Therefore, it is possible that increased feelings of satiety
following a meal high in n-3 PUFA content could aid weight loss by
reducing subsequent food intake. Appetite suppression could also be
mediated through FFAR4 (GPR 120). Omega-3 PUFAs are agonists for
FFAR4 [132], which elicits the secretion of cholecystokinin, a peptide
hormone that is synthesized and released from the small intestine and
has roles in hunger suppression [133].
6.5. Insulin resistance
Adipose tissue inflammation is at least in part responsible for
obesity-associated insulin resistance. Since n-3 PUFAs alleviate
adipose tissue inflammation as outlined above, reducing adipose
tissue inflammation is a possible mechanism for n-3-PUFA-associated
improvements in insulin sensitivity observed in animal models.
Hepatic insulin resistance in which both glucose production and
lipogenesis are increased is characteristic of the metabolic dysregulation
seen in obesity and T2DM. This dysregulation is attributed to
reductions in proximal insulin signaling kinases, such as P13K and
AKT, which hinder gluconeogenesis, as well as activation of mTORC1
and p70S6K, which control lipogenesis [134,135].
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, which is produced by the liver,
adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, has been shown to reduce both
hepatic glucose production and plasma glucose levels, while it also
increases insulin sensitivity and adipocyte glucose uptake [136].
Circulating FGF21 levels are elevated in diet-induced obese mice [137]
and obese and type 2 diabetic humans [138], suggesting obesityrelated
FGF21 resistance. Omega-3 PUFAs attenuate HF-diet-induced
increases in FGF21 [139] with associated reductions in hyperglycemia,
hypertriglyceridemia and plasma insulin levels [140,141]. This could
be a potential mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs improve insulin
resistance.
Omega-3 PUFA supplementation prevents insulin resistance in
muscle of rats fed an HF diet [142], partly by improving glycogen
synthesis [143]. Omega-3 PUFAs also decrease fat content in muscle
and maintain normal PI3K activity and expression and transcription of
GLUT 4 receptors in muscle and thus improve myotubule glucose
uptake. Omega-3 PUFAs also promote inhibition of hepatic glucose
production [142].
10 K. Albracht-Schulte et al. / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 58 (2018) 1–16
Hence, n-3 PUFAs may be a valuable nutritional tool for preventing
or diminishing muscular and hepatic insulin resistance associated
with obesity. However, n-3 PUFAs appear ineffective once T2DM is
established [144].
6.6. Lipid metabolism
In both animal and human studies of n-3 PUFA supplementation,
reductions in weight or fat mass were not accompanied by changes in
energy intake (Tables 1–4). Omega-3 PUFAs can partition dietary fuel
away from storage and toward oxidation by suppressing lipogenic
genes and activating genes that encode for mitochondrial and
peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in both the liver and muscle.
Given their cardioprotective properties, n-3 PUFAs can improve
endothelial function in patients with varying metabolic profiles [145],
possibly through increased production of nitric oxide [146]. Furthermore,
during exercise, fish oil has been shown to increase arterial
dilation and blood flow to skeletal muscle [147]. Hence, improved
blood flow may increase the delivery of fats to be utilized as energy in
skeletal muscle, especially during exercise.
Regulation of lipid metabolism may vary by n-3 PUFA type, as well
as by fat depot. For example, EPA is preferentially directed towards β-
oxidation, while DHA and DPA are spared from catabolism and
deposited in tissues [148]. Moreover, gene expression of fatty acid
synthase [149], hormone-sensitive lipase, lipoprotein lipase and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in retroperitoneal fat is decreased
with DHA and mixed EPA/DHA supplementation but not
with EPA supplementation alone [41].
Portions of hepatic TG are secreted via very low density lipoprotein
(VLDL), which delivers TG to peripheral tissues, such as WAT. Hepatic
VLDL secretion is enhanced in obese individuals [150] possibly due to
increased fatty acid delivery, elevated glucose and insulin concentrations,
as well as impaired fat oxidation, which increases fatty acid
esterification into TG [151]. Omega-3 PUFAs reduce lipogenesis and
reduce hepatic VLDL secretion [51]. In vitro, n-3-PUFA-treated HepG2
cells have decreased hepatic VLDL secretion [152] and reduced
apolipoprotein B100 production [153]. This has been validated in
both DHA- and n-3-PUFA-supplemented animals [154]. Hence,
through inhibition of VLDL formation, n-3 PUFAs could limit the
supply of fatty acids to adipocytes and thereby limit adipocyte size and
mass. In a deregulated system, n-3 PUFAs would also limit the amount
of fatty acids delivered to muscle and liver. Additionally, in animal
models, n-3 PUFAs modulate cholesteryl ester transfer protein
mediated exchanges, resulting in increased blood HDL cholesterol
and possibly apolipoprotein A-1 concentrations [155,156].
Omega-3 PUFAs alter expression and nuclear localization of both
the transcription factor sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1
(SREBP-1) and the carbohydrate response element binding protein
(ChREBP), which control several lipogeneic genes, including those
regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis [154,157]. Nuclear
translocation of ChREBP is inhibited by n-3 PUFAs and thus results in
reduced expression of lipogenic and glycolytic genes, including FAS
and pyruvate kinase respectively [158]. Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs
suppress hepatic lipogenesis by reducing both messenger RNA
(mRNA) and active protein expression of SREBP-1c, which results in
reduced expression of many genes involved in lipogenesis, including
FAS and acetyl-coA carboxylase [159–161]. Reduced SREBP-1c
expression, via n-3 PUFA, has been attributed to inhibited transcription
of nascent precursor SREBP-1c, accelerated transcript decay and
reduced levels of the mature cleaved form of SREBP-1c [159,160],
possibly through inhibition of proteolytic processing and reduced
feed-forward activation of the Srebf1 gene. This inhibition could be
due to interference with insulin signaling pathways, which promotes
the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1c, potentially via an AKTdependent
mechanism [162,163].
The role of liver X receptor (LXR) is controversial. In vivo, EPA
suppression of SREBP-1c promoter activity is dependent upon an
intact SRE but not LXR response elements, suggesting that decreased
transcription of nascent SREBP-1c with n-3 PUFA treatment results
from decreased availability and thus reduced feed-forward activation
[163]. In contrast, others indicate a role in the inhibition of LXRα in
reduced SREBP-1c expression with n-3 PUFA, but this may be
dependent upon cell types [164]. Accelerated degradation of SREBP-
1c mRNA has also been proposed as a mechanism for reduced SREBP-
1c expression [165]. Omega-3 PUFAs inhibit SREBP-1c cleavage
processing, but the cleavage sites are unknown [166].
Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by n-3 PUFA can also
suppress SREBP-1c cleavage and nuclear translocation, perhaps via
serine phosphorylation and/or by blocking activation of the insulinresponsive
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/
S6K-signaling pathway [167]. SREBP-1c synthesis, transport and
maturation are increased with insulin [162].
PUFAs, prostaglandins and leukotrienes can all act as ligands for
PPARs. PPARs are transcription factors that form heterodimers with
retinoid X receptors in the promoter regions of several genes involved
in lipid and glucose metabolism [168,169]. For example, n-3 PUFA
activation of PPARα decreases lipogenesis by suppressing FAS activity
[161,170]. However, lipogenesis suppression by n-3 PUFA does not
require PPARα activation [171].
PPARγ acts as a master regulator of adipogenesis and controls
several genes and adipokines in lipid and glucose metabolism. Omega-
3 PUFAs act as ligands for PPARγ and modulate several PPARγ target
genes in mice [172] and 3T3-L1 adipocytes [97]. Omega-3 PUFAs
enhance PPARγ binding to PPAR-response element in the promoter
region of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which promotes
adipogenesis and alleviates hypoxia-induced adipocyte inflammation
and insulin resistance [173]. It has been suggested that PPARγ plays a
significant role in the ability of n-3 PUFA, specifically DHA, to stimulate
M2 macrophage polarization and thereby reduce inflammation since
these results are not seen in PPARγ knockdown RAW264.7 cells [174].
Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to increase mitochondrial
biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver [175,176], adipose tissue
[43] and small intestine [177] of rodents, possibly through PPARα and
Cox3 induction [175,178,179]. PUFA-controlled genes involved in lipid
oxidation and thermogenesis include mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase
[180], peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase [64,181], hepatic CPT-1
[154], FABP [127] and fatty acid transporter proteins [182].
Activation of PPARα can also increase fatty acid oxidation.
Increases in fatty acid oxidation by n-3 PUFA may also be mediated
by AMPK, a known regulator of cellular energy metabolism. AMPK upregulation
by n-3 PUFA has been demonstrated in both adipose tissue
and cultured adipocytes [55].
Taken together, n-3 PUFAs regulate lipid metabolism, favoring fatty
acid oxidation and suppression of lipogenesis and leading to a
favorable lipid profile and adipocyte metabolism.
6.7. Thermogenesis
Many have examined cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis
mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in the
presence of n-3 PUFA [43,48,54]. UCPs are inner mitochondrial
proteins that function to transport hydrogen ions across the
mitochondrial inner membrane. We have recently shown that BAT
from EPA-supplemented mice expresses higher levels of thermogenic
genes, such as PRDM16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma
coactivator-1alpha and UCP1 [183].
Omega-3 PUFAs increase mitochondrial oxidative capacity in WAT
[43] and skeletal muscle, possibly through UCP-3 up-regulation [48], but
not in BAT or liver [43].However, because most studies were carried out at
20°C, it is unclear whether increases in mitochondrial oxidative capacity
K. Albracht-Schulte et al. / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 58 (2018) 1–16 11
are n-3 PUFA mediated or cold induced. Janovska et al. reported no
differences in body weight but decreased epididymal fat mass after
feeding an HF diet supplemented with n-3 PUFA in mice kept at 30°C,
indicating that n-3 PUFA could attenuate body fat accumulation even at
thermoneutrality and independent of cold-induced thermogenesis [52].
Mechanisms underlying the role of n-3 PUFA in possible induction of
energy expenditure and prevention of body fat accumulation should be
investigated further at various temperatures since thermogenic markers
are activated even at 22°C [183].
6.8. Lean mass
The mechanismby which n-3 PUFAs have the potential to increase
lean mass is not fully understood but likely involves both catabolic and
anabolic pathways. Increased lean mass would result in improved
body composition and possibly improved metabolism. Even though
increases in RMR have been demonstrated with increases in lean mass
[184], post-n-3 PUFA supplementation increases in lean mass are not
always accompanied by increases in RMR [66]. Future studies are
needed to examine the relationship between n-3 PUFA changes in lean
mass in relation to RMR since metabolic rate significantly influences
body weight.
Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to attenuate muscle protein
breakdown in isolated muscles of mice [185]. Increases in protein
synthesis may be mediated by n-3 PUFA activation of the mTORp70s6k
signaling pathway [186], a key pathway in muscle cell growth.
Similarly, Clark et al. reported increased whole-body protein turnover
under insulin stimulation but did not see significant increases in lean
mass following 9 months of n-3 PUFA supplementation [187].
Certainly, changes in protein dynamics may not translate to increases
in protein mass.
One possible mechanism of n-3 PUFA in increasing lean mass is the
alteration of protein dynamics related to n-3 PUFA anti-inflammatory
properties [66] since proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α can increase
protein degradation via ATP-ubiquitin-dependent pathways [188].
Another such potential mechanism relates to the ability of n-3
PUFA to lower cortisol levels [189]. Noreen et al. reported decreases in
cortisol with n-3 PUFA supplementation but noted a significant
correlation between cortisol level and changes in body composition
[66]. Others have shown that a reduction in fat mass does not lower
cortisol production [190]. Hence, n-3 PUFA supplementation may
modulate cortisol levels so as to improve body composition [66].
Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 have been
shown to increase blood levels of cortisol [191], which increases
protein catabolism [192]. Hence, anti-inflammatory properties of n-3
PUFA could aid in disrupting this pathway. However, increased muscle
protein synthesis with n-3 PUFA supplementation is not likely
mediated by changes in inflammation in a healthy population [186].
Further investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by
which n-3 PUFAs alter protein dynamics to increase lean mass.
6.9. Epigenetics and microRNA
Epigenetics may be an important contributor to many chronic
diseases, including obesity [193,194]. Limited studies have examined
n-3 PUFA and epigenetic modifications even though the expression of
several genes involved in metabolic homeostasis is regulated by DNA
methylation. The few that have been conducted report conflicting
evidence for DNA methylation and n-3 PUFA. In a population-based
study, n-3 PUFA intake was associated withDNAmethylation in Alaska
Yup’ik people [195]. A few studies have reported that fish oil
supplementation did not alter the methylation pattern of genes
[196,197], including leptin and the leptin receptor, in mouse
epididymal fat [196]. It may be that n-3 PUFAs work through
epigenetic mechanisms other than methylation [197]. In dietinduced
obese mice, leptin expression may be regulated by n-3
PUFA via changes in methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 and
histone modifications [198]. Since an HF diet has been shown to cause
changes in the methylation of gene-specific promoter regions in the
liver [199] and WAT [200], the influence of n-3 PUFAs on epigenetic
modifications warrants further investigation.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that act as
posttranscriptional regulators of genes by acting as sequencespecific
inhibitors of mRNA. These miRNAs target transcription factors
to indirectly affect entire signaling pathways. It has been documented
that miRNAs act as key regulators in the pathogenesis of metabolic
disease by affecting inflammation [201] and lipid metabolism [202].
Recent studies have shown n-3 PUFA to modulate miRNA
expression [201,203,204]. A diet enriched in PUFA correlated to
changes in circulating miRNAs, specifically miR-106a, along with
changes in other miRNAs related to lipid metabolism and adipokine
secretion in healthy women [203]. In animal models, n-3 PUFAs
suppress inflammation through down-regulation of miR-19b-3p,
-146b-5p and -183-5p by targeting toll-like receptor, NOD-like
receptor, RIG-I-like receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinase and
transforming growth factor-β pathways [201]. In obese rats, DHA has
been shown to counteract obesity-related increases in hepatic miR-
33a and miR-122, thus improving lipid metabolism via decreased
SREBP2 and FAS expression, respectively [204]. Therefore, fully
characterizing n-3 PUFA modulation of miRNA involved in key
pathways, such as lipid metabolism and inflammation, is warranted
and could play a key role in targeting MetS and obesity-related
therapies.
7. Future perspectives
Both animal and human studies have examined the beneficial
effects of combining n-3 PUFA with other dietary supplements and
pharmaceuticals including antidiabetic drugs, L-alanyl-L-glutamine
[205], as well as α-lipoic acid [118] and krill oil [206]. Animal studies
using the combination of n-3 PUFA and rosiglitazone have reported
significantly greater reductions in body weight [63,143], enhanced
oxidation of fatty acids [207] and counteraction of lipogenesis than
with rosiglitazone therapy alone [63]. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation
in addition to antidiabetic pharmaceuticals could attenuate body
weight gain caused by pharmaceuticals and should be further
investigated [208].
8. Conclusions
The management of obesity has shifted from a narrow focus on BMI
to the wider field that includes the complications of obesity, with the
goal to reduce obesity-associated comorbidities [209]. While n-3
PUFAs have not yet shown consistent benefits in terms of weight loss
in humans, improvements in the metabolic profile of obese individuals
have been demonstrated. Therefore, n-3 PUFAs may be an important
adjunct to obesity management along with lifestyle modification and
pharmacotherapy. Further study of the genetic and epigenetic
molecular targets related to metabolism, appetite and energetics
could aid the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for obesityassociated
metabolic disorders.
