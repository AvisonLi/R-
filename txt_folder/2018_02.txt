This paper investigates the role of news implied volatility (NVIX), a measure of uncertainty,
in long-term stock market volatility in developed markets. The results showed that NVIX
has a positive and significant impact on stock market variances in the full sample period
using the GARCH–MIDAS model. Furthermore, out-of-sample forecasting results showed
that including NVIX generally improves forecasting performance; that is, the GARCH–
MIDAS model, with the long-term component driven by realized volatility (RV) and NVIX,
outperforms those with only RV in terms of forecasting performance.

1. Introduction
The impact of uncertainty is intuitively appealing in financial asset pricing among academics and practitioners [1].
Despite its importance, the measurement of uncertainty is challenging due to the inherent difficulty of observing individuals’
subjective magnitudes and the complexity of stock market [2]. Between the financial systems and the traders, there may
be reciprocal ties, of irregular number and weight, which create a highly connected structure with the features of a
complex network [3]. The existed literature has previously constructed various uncertainty indices, such as macroeconomic
uncertainty [4], common volatility [5,6], and newspaper coverage frequency [7]. However, the literature only focuses on
macroeconomic conditions, ignoring the vital roles of public media and investor attentions, which are more flexible and
timely than economic data. Fortunately, a new measure of uncertainty called news implied volatility (NVIX) was proposed
by Manela and Moreira [8]. It is a good proxy for the evolution of investors’ concerns regarding these topics. It has four useful
features that allow us to further investigate the relation between uncertainty and stock market returns. First, it measures
uncertainty from the perspective of investors’ concerns. It was constructed from the co-movement between the front-page

coverage of the Wall Street Journal and options implied volatility (VIX). NVIX strongly focuses on investors’ concerns or
attention to events. Second, the time-varying NVIX dates back to the last decade of the 19th century and includes some global
events. We can directly test whether NVIX predicts economic disasters in stock markets. Third, there are five categories of
NVIX that are plausibly related, in varying degrees, to disaster concerns and allow us to identify the kinds of risks that are
important to investors. Fourth, it is estimated through machine learning techniques that uncover information from this rich
and unique text data set [9]. The performance of NVIX is better and more stable that ordinary least squares (OLS) for outof-
sample predictions. It is widely recognized that uncertainties have significant influence on stock market volatilities [10–
13]. US, the largest economy in the world, is the largest trade partner of developed countries, whose economic conditions
are highly correlated with economic conditions of the countries. As stock prices do not depend on internal factors only
to companies, but also the behavior of the global market, it is natural that markets suffer externalities, especially of the
oscillations of the economies of developed countries [14]. Stock market volatility is strongly influenced by foreign factors
when the stock markets are integrated [15], US uncertainty may have great predictive power for other developed countries.
Therefore, we would like to provide more evidence of the relations between developed stock market volatility and NVIX.
Our theoretical contribution to uncertainty and asset pricing is twofold. First, our results provide empirical evidence
for the role of uncertainty in determining stock market volatility. We employed the GARCH–MIDAS model proposed by
Engle et al. [16], which enables us to directly identify the effect of uncertainty on the secular component of stock market
volatility. Second, we use NVIX as a proxy of uncertainty, which, being an index related to investor attention. On the other
hand, previous studies involved research on uncertainty in fundamental levels. Thus, little evidence of uncertainty related
to investor behaviors has been found. Actually, individual investors as one important kind of agents in the stock market,
their decision may affect the movements of the market price and volatility [17]. We provide evidence on the positive and
significant relationship between NVIX and stock market volatility.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology. Section 3 provides the data diagnostics. The empirical
results are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes our study.
2. Methodology
2.1. GARCH–MIDAS model
To investigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty on long-run stock market volatility, we use the GARCH–MIDAS
model of Engle et al. [16].Weallow the long-run variance to depend on the lagged NVIX and a MIDAS polynomial that applies
to monthly NVIX. We refer to gi,t and τt as the short- and long-run variance components, respectively. While the transitory
volatility component changes with daily frequency, i, and the long-run component changes with monthly frequency, t. We
denote N(t) as the number of days in month t. N(t) is incorporated into model as RVt , the realized volatility, which is the
sum of squared daily returns of N(t) days in month t. The GARCH–MIDAS model is specified as follows:
ri,t = μ +
√
τt · gi,tξi,t (1)
where short-run component, gi,t , follows a GARCH (1,1) process,
gi,t = (1 − α − β) + α
(ri−1,t − μ)2
τt
+ βgi−1,t (2)
with α > 0 and β > 0, α + β < 1.
The daily realized volatility (RV) is equal to the sum of the squared intraday returns over a given day, and thus, uses
intraday information to define an aggregated daily volatility measure. The method is based on the notion of realized volatility,
which was introduced in the literature by Taylor and Xu [18] and Andersen and Bollerslev [19]. Then, we specify the longterm
component, τt by smoothing RV in the spirit of MIDAS regression and MIDAS filtering. we get
log(τt ) = m + θ

where K is the number of periods over which we smooth volatility. To study the impact of NVIX on the return variance, we
further modify Eq. (3) by involving NVIX along with RV,
log(τt ) = m + θRV

where XNVIX

specifications (3) and (4) comprises so-called beta weights, and is defined as

where X refers to a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model. Following Engle et al. [16], we fix the weight ωX

the weights monotonically decreasing over the lags; then, we obtain

Eqs. (1) through (3) and (5) form a GARCH–MIDAS model for time-varying conditional variance with fixed time span RVs
and parameter space, given byΘ =
{
μ, α, β,m, θ, ωRV

}
. Eqs. (1) through (5) form a GARCH–MIDAS model with RV+NVIX
and parameter space, Θ = {μ, α, β,m, θRV , θNVIX , ωRV
2 , ωNVIX
2 }.
Finally, the total conditional variance is defined as follows:
σ2
i,t = τt · gi,t . (5)
2.2. Estimation of models
We follow Engle et al. [16] and take the conventional approach to estimate GARCH-type models. The parameters are
estimated by Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE). It is proved that the innovation of the returns is asymptotically
consistent and the asymptotic standard errors can be estimated consistently under the assumption of conditional normality,
even though the true density could be of some other type. Robust standard errors and the outer product of gradients (OPG)
estimate are used when estimating covariance matrix through maximum likelihood. Similar to Asgharian et al. [20], we use
two different model specifications. The models differ with respect to the definition of the long-term variance component,
τt , while Eqs. (2) and (5) for short-term variance, gi,t , remain the same.
The realized volatility is a good measure of the volatility of the long-term component [21]. To compare the effect of RV
and NVIX on the long-term component of the variance, and following prior literature [12,16,22], we use only RV, defined
by the MIDAS model in Eq. (3), in the long-term component of the variance as a benchmark model. The specification
employs monthly RV as an explanatory variable; it is labeled as GARCH–MIDAS with RV. We progress by focusing on an
empirical measure of daily return variability called realized volatility, which is easily computed from high-frequency intraperiod
returns. The theory of quadratic variation suggests that, under suitable conditions, realized volatility is an unbiased
and highly efficient estimator of return volatility, as discussed in [23] (hereafter, ABDL), as well as in concurrent work
by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [24,25]. In addition, to formally investigate whether
the NVIX variables have additional explanatory power over RV, we modify the long-term component by simultaneously
including RV and a macro variable, XNVIX
t−k . This modification is supposed to capture the information explained by both the
NVIX and RV. We refer to this model as GARCH–MIDAS with RV+NVIX. In line with our previous findings, we set ωX
1 = 1,
and estimate weighting schemes for RV and NVIX.
2.3. Forecasting performance
One of the commonly cited arguments for using a wide array of forecast error statistics is that there is no consensus on
using a single loss function that is most appropriate for the evaluation of volatility models [26]. Thus, to evaluate the variance
prediction of a specific model, we employ alternative measures of forecast accuracy to six loss functions, root mean squared
prediction error, and root mean absolute error for conditional variance (RMSE and RMAE, respectively), and for standard
deviation (RMSD and RMAD, respectively), along with MMEO and MMEU, as follows:

Patton [27] showed that when using squared returns as a volatility proxy, as we do in our paper, some of the loss functions
are, in fact, not robust. Thus, we further use DM test proposed by Diebold and Mariano [28] to compare the prediction
accuracy of the two competing models. They propose and evaluate explicit tests for the null hypothesis of no difference
in the accuracy of two competing forecasts. In contrast to previously developed tests, a wide variety of accuracy measures
called the DM test can be used when comparing models. Next, we show the many advantages of the DM test. As Diebold and
Mariano [28] show, the DM test has general applicability, when the forecast errors of models can be non-Gaussian, nonzero
mean, serially correlated, and contemporaneously correlated. Further, the framework is obvious and extremely simple. Most
importantly, DM test is applicable under a very wide variety of models and loss structures [29].
3. Data
In this study, we investigate the role ofmonthly NVIX on daily stock market volatility. We obtain G7 stock market indices
from Bloomberg as proxies for developed markets, including the S&P index for the US, FTSE index for the UK, CAC index
for France, DAX index for Germany, FTSEMIB index for Italy, TSX index for Canada, and Nikkei index for Japan. The monthly
NVIX is a text-based uncertainty constructed by Manela and Moreira [8].1 The sample period spans from the first trading day
of January 1998 to the last trading day of March 2016 through our manuscript. Since the trading days of different markets
differ, the observations are different among different countries.
Table 1 reports the summary statistics of daily returns of G7 stock markets, along with the NVIX index. According to unit
root tests, such as the Augment Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) test, the calculated statistics for the daily return
of G7 stock markets and NVIX index are much less than their critical values, indicating that all the variables are stationary. All
the variables are stationary according to unit root test. Meanwhile, the movements of monthly NVIX index data are displayed
in Fig. 1. We observe that NVIX is highly volatile; it shows peaks around the recession periods.
4. Empirical results
In this section, we cover the estimation of GARCH–MIDAS volatility models for the whole sample period. Then, we
consider the return predictability for the GARCH–MIDAS model with RV + NVIX.

4.1. Impact of NVIX on the stock market volatility for the full sample
To evaluate the extent to which volatility is related to NVIX, we include NVIX in the GARCH–MIDAS model. Since RV
is fairly persistent, we include lags of stock market volatility in the model. Table 2 presents the use of full-sample QMLE
parameter estimates of the GARCH–MIDAS models with RV and RV + NVIX.
Before parameter estimation of GARCH–MIDAS models, we need to determine the lag length of RV and NVIX. Based on
previous literature,weassume that 12 is an appropriate lag length for all variables [12,16]. In addition,wecalculate the values
of log-likelihood function (LLF), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for different lag
lengths and find that their values are minimum for a lag length of 12.
First, we note that the results in the table show that almost all parameters are significant. Another interesting feature of
the GARCH–MIDAS model in Table 2 is that the sums of α and β are noticeably less than 1. Though the sum in a standard
GARCH model is typically 1, our results are still within the stationarity boundary, α + β < 1, so the difference will
not influence the results and conclusions, which remain accurate and reliable. This finding is similar to Engle and Rangel
[22], where the sum of mean values of these two parameters is significantly smaller than 1, which indicates that in all
specifications the short-term volatility component mean-reverts to the long-term trend. The estimated α represents the
effect of the past innovation on the conditional volatility and the estimated β represents the volatility persistence effect. All
the estimated α > 0 in Table 2 indicates that the past innovation has positive impacts on the volatility. All the estimated
β < 1 indicates that the log returns of different markets have limited variance and the time series has weak stationarity,
and thus, there are obvious volatility clustering and persistence effects in all the G7 markets.
Next, we take a closer look at the estimates of the long-run component, τt . The sign of θRV indicates the response of
long-run volatility to RVs. The parameter estimates of θNVIX for NVIX range from 0.824 for Canada to 1.752 for the UK. Hence,
in all cases, the parameters are positive and statistically significant, implying that a higher NVIX would bring higher longterm
volatilities, and thus, NVIX could better anticipate long-term volatility in G7 markets. The results mainly reflect that
uncertainty for the US may be ‘‘bad news’’ for developed countries, leading to higher stock volatility.
To assess the economic information content and find out how much of the variation in the expected quarterly variance of
a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model can be attributed to the variation in NVIX, we provide the value of the variance ratio (VR)
statistic proposed by Lo and MacKinlay [30] for each model. By comparing variance estimators derived from data sampled at
different frequencies, they rejected the random walk hypothesis for weekly stock market returns. In general, we define VR as
the fraction of the sample variance of the log of total quarterly conditional volatility, var(log(τ X
t gX
t )), which can be explained
by the sample variance of the log long-term component, var(log(τ X
t )), as follows,
VR(X) =
var(log(τ X
t ))
var(log(τ X
t gX
t ))
(13)
where X refers to a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model. The VR we defined here relates the sample variance of the log of the
long-term component of a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model to the sample variance of the log of the total expected variance
of the baseline GARCH–MIDAS-RV model with restricted filter [12]. The VR estimates indicate that the long-run volatility
of the MIDAS model with RV + NVIX contributes substantially more than the long-run volatility of the MIDAS model with

RV. The results in Table 3 suggest that NVIX carries information about long-term volatility that is complementary to that
contained in realized volatility. There is also extensive literature applying the variance ratio test to support their idea. Engle
et al. [16] computed the ratio to measure how much of the expected volatility can be explained by economic variables.
Christiansen [31] and Baele [32] obtained a measure of the impact of global, regional, and local volatility-spillover effects on
the local variance from VR. Bastos and Caiado [33] employed variance ratio tests of the random walk hypothesis to investigate
the interdependence of global equity markets in terms of index return predictability. In addition, the finding suggests that,
among all the stock markets, Italy has the most important long-run component contribution – approximately 44% – during
the full sample period. In addition, we observe that the levels of likelihood, the AIC, and BIC of the GARCH–MIDAS model
with RV + NVIX are extremely close to those in the model with RV. The results of the loss functions are not all consistent;
thus, we cannot identify which model performs better. We appraise the forecast performance of RV and RV+NVIX models in
Section 4.2, wherein we revisit this issue.
The variances and long-run volatilities for the GARCH–MIDAS models are plotted in Fig. 2. As expected, the two
components of the models follow a similar trend, although the long-run correlation is smoother. In addition, Fig. 2 implies
a very interesting cyclical pattern in the evolution of long-run volatility. During recession periods, the high NVIX indicates
a volatile macroeconomic policy environment, which dampened investors’ confidence. It further caused the synchronously
steep fall in the stock markets. In addition, we notice that the MIDAS models with RV and NVIX provide a better fit than
those with RV.
4.2. Out-of-sample prediction
The extensive literature on volatility predictability shows that, although the in-sample analysis provides more efficient
parameter estimates, out-of-sample tests seem to be a more relevant standard for assessing genuine predictability in real

Note: The table shows the loss functions of the different models in predicting G7 stock market volatilities. We use two alternative specifications in the
GARCH–MIDAS equation, RV model, and RV + NVIX model. The out-of-sample forecasts cover the period from January 2008 to March 2016.
In this sub-section, we analyze the ability of the GARCH–MIDAS model to forecast variances. Given that the parameters
of the GARCH–MIDAS model may be time-varying, we use a 21-day rolling window to undertake out-of-sample variance
prediction. Our out-of-sample forecast covers the period from January 2008 to March 2016. The initial estimation period
is January 1998 to December 2007, and we use the estimated parameters for this period to forecast variances of the first
21 days in the out-of-sample period. Then, we incorporate the 21 days into the estimation period, and use the estimated
parameters for the new estimation period to forecast variances of the second 21 days in the out-of-sample period. By letting
the window roll forward, we can obtain all the forecasts of variances in the out-of-sample period.
Since GARCH volatility is commonly used in the literature on volatility forecasting, we investigate whether the NVIX
variable can improve the performance of the GARCH–MIDAS model. As Table 4 shows, the stock market volatility forecast
based on the MIDAS models with RV and NVIX produces substantially smaller function values than the forecast based on
the GARCH–MIDAS model with RV in all the loss functions. Furthermore, we present the results of the DM tests for outof-
sample performance of different models in Table 5. In comparison with the RV model, the RV + NVIX models for most
of the loss functions generate positive DM statistics, which are statistically significant and economically large. Hence, our
out-of-sample analysis shows that adding NVIX information to the long-term variance component of the GARCH–MIDAS
model significantly improves the prediction ability of the model.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the impact of NVIX on the stock market volatilities in developed markets by employing a
GARCH–MIDAS model. NVIX is a news-based implied volatility index proposed by Manela and Moreira [8] that measures

uncertainty and disaster concerns. Our empirical results showed that NVIX has a positive and significant influence on the
volatility of all the G7 stock markets, especially for the long-run component. Furthermore, out-of-sample tests showed that
the GARCH–MIDAS model with RV and NVIX outperforms the model with RV. NVIX significantly improve the prediction of
volatilities for the developed markets. The results have implications for market participants, as well as policymakers. First,
this finding implies that when news and investor confidence in US changes, the stock markets in other G7 countries may
experience fluctuations in the future. This confirms the spillover effects of US uncertainty on other developed stock markets.
Therefore, investors in developed markets should pay more attention to the US, which is the main driver of uncertainty and
a key factor in determining market volatilities. With increased efficiency after the financial crisis in 2007–2009, investors
should be aware of the important role of NVIX in asset allocation. They should be careful of the increased volatility of stock
markets in developed countries in periods of uncertainty and can probably consider NVIX to avoid investment risk through
derivatives trading and policy making. Second, our empirical evidence shows that various stock markets in developed
countries will be influenced more or less by the shocks from the US. Policymakers and financial institutions should pay
more attention to the information contained in news related to the US and investors’ concern to decrease the volatility of
markets and manage risk.

This paper investigates the role of news implied volatility (NVIX), a measure of uncertainty,
in long-term stock market volatility in developed markets. The results showed that NVIX
has a positive and significant impact on stock market variances in the full sample period
using the GARCH–MIDAS model. Furthermore, out-of-sample forecasting results showed
that including NVIX generally improves forecasting performance; that is, the GARCH–
MIDAS model, with the long-term component driven by realized volatility (RV) and NVIX,
outperforms those with only RV in terms of forecasting performance.

1. Introduction
The impact of uncertainty is intuitively appealing in financial asset pricing among academics and practitioners [1].
Despite its importance, the measurement of uncertainty is challenging due to the inherent difficulty of observing individuals’
subjective magnitudes and the complexity of stock market [2]. Between the financial systems and the traders, there may
be reciprocal ties, of irregular number and weight, which create a highly connected structure with the features of a
complex network [3]. The existed literature has previously constructed various uncertainty indices, such as macroeconomic
uncertainty [4], common volatility [5,6], and newspaper coverage frequency [7]. However, the literature only focuses on
macroeconomic conditions, ignoring the vital roles of public media and investor attentions, which are more flexible and
timely than economic data. Fortunately, a new measure of uncertainty called news implied volatility (NVIX) was proposed
by Manela and Moreira [8]. It is a good proxy for the evolution of investors’ concerns regarding these topics. It has four useful
features that allow us to further investigate the relation between uncertainty and stock market returns. First, it measures
uncertainty from the perspective of investors’ concerns. It was constructed from the co-movement between the front-page

coverage of the Wall Street Journal and options implied volatility (VIX). NVIX strongly focuses on investors’ concerns or
attention to events. Second, the time-varying NVIX dates back to the last decade of the 19th century and includes some global
events. We can directly test whether NVIX predicts economic disasters in stock markets. Third, there are five categories of
NVIX that are plausibly related, in varying degrees, to disaster concerns and allow us to identify the kinds of risks that are
important to investors. Fourth, it is estimated through machine learning techniques that uncover information from this rich
and unique text data set [9]. The performance of NVIX is better and more stable that ordinary least squares (OLS) for outof-
sample predictions. It is widely recognized that uncertainties have significant influence on stock market volatilities [10–
13]. US, the largest economy in the world, is the largest trade partner of developed countries, whose economic conditions
are highly correlated with economic conditions of the countries. As stock prices do not depend on internal factors only
to companies, but also the behavior of the global market, it is natural that markets suffer externalities, especially of the
oscillations of the economies of developed countries [14]. Stock market volatility is strongly influenced by foreign factors
when the stock markets are integrated [15], US uncertainty may have great predictive power for other developed countries.
Therefore, we would like to provide more evidence of the relations between developed stock market volatility and NVIX.
Our theoretical contribution to uncertainty and asset pricing is twofold. First, our results provide empirical evidence
for the role of uncertainty in determining stock market volatility. We employed the GARCH–MIDAS model proposed by
Engle et al. [16], which enables us to directly identify the effect of uncertainty on the secular component of stock market
volatility. Second, we use NVIX as a proxy of uncertainty, which, being an index related to investor attention. On the other
hand, previous studies involved research on uncertainty in fundamental levels. Thus, little evidence of uncertainty related
to investor behaviors has been found. Actually, individual investors as one important kind of agents in the stock market,
their decision may affect the movements of the market price and volatility [17]. We provide evidence on the positive and
significant relationship between NVIX and stock market volatility.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology. Section 3 provides the data diagnostics. The empirical
results are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes our study.
2. Methodology
2.1. GARCH–MIDAS model
To investigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty on long-run stock market volatility, we use the GARCH–MIDAS
model of Engle et al. [16].Weallow the long-run variance to depend on the lagged NVIX and a MIDAS polynomial that applies
to monthly NVIX. We refer to gi,t and τt as the short- and long-run variance components, respectively. While the transitory
volatility component changes with daily frequency, i, and the long-run component changes with monthly frequency, t. We
denote N(t) as the number of days in month t. N(t) is incorporated into model as RVt , the realized volatility, which is the
sum of squared daily returns of N(t) days in month t. The GARCH–MIDAS model is specified as follows:
ri,t = μ +
√
τt · gi,tξi,t (1)
where short-run component, gi,t , follows a GARCH (1,1) process,
gi,t = (1 − α − β) + α
(ri−1,t − μ)2
τt
+ βgi−1,t (2)
with α > 0 and β > 0, α + β < 1.
The daily realized volatility (RV) is equal to the sum of the squared intraday returns over a given day, and thus, uses
intraday information to define an aggregated daily volatility measure. The method is based on the notion of realized volatility,
which was introduced in the literature by Taylor and Xu [18] and Andersen and Bollerslev [19]. Then, we specify the longterm
component, τt by smoothing RV in the spirit of MIDAS regression and MIDAS filtering. we get

where K is the number of periods over which we smooth volatility. To study the impact of NVIX on the return variance, we
further modify Eq. (3) by involving NVIX along with RV,

where XNVIX

specifications (3) and (4) comprises so-called beta weights, and is defined as

the weights monotonically decreasing over the lags; then, we obtain

Eqs. (1) through (3) and (5) form a GARCH–MIDAS model for time-varying conditional variance with fixed time span RVs
and parameter space, given byΘ =
{
μ, α, β,m, θ, ωRV

}
. Eqs. (1) through (5) form a GARCH–MIDAS model with RV+NVIX
and parameter space, Θ = {μ, α, β,m, θRV , θNVIX , ωRV
2 , ωNVIX
2 }.
Finally, the total conditional variance is defined as follows:
σ2
i,t = τt · gi,t . (5)
2.2. Estimation of models
We follow Engle et al. [16] and take the conventional approach to estimate GARCH-type models. The parameters are
estimated by Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE). It is proved that the innovation of the returns is asymptotically
consistent and the asymptotic standard errors can be estimated consistently under the assumption of conditional normality,
even though the true density could be of some other type. Robust standard errors and the outer product of gradients (OPG)
estimate are used when estimating covariance matrix through maximum likelihood. Similar to Asgharian et al. [20], we use
two different model specifications. The models differ with respect to the definition of the long-term variance component,
τt , while Eqs. (2) and (5) for short-term variance, gi,t , remain the same.
The realized volatility is a good measure of the volatility of the long-term component [21]. To compare the effect of RV
and NVIX on the long-term component of the variance, and following prior literature [12,16,22], we use only RV, defined
by the MIDAS model in Eq. (3), in the long-term component of the variance as a benchmark model. The specification
employs monthly RV as an explanatory variable; it is labeled as GARCH–MIDAS with RV. We progress by focusing on an
empirical measure of daily return variability called realized volatility, which is easily computed from high-frequency intraperiod
returns. The theory of quadratic variation suggests that, under suitable conditions, realized volatility is an unbiased
and highly efficient estimator of return volatility, as discussed in [23] (hereafter, ABDL), as well as in concurrent work
by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [24,25]. In addition, to formally investigate whether
the NVIX variables have additional explanatory power over RV, we modify the long-term component by simultaneously
including RV and a macro variable, XNVIX
t−k . This modification is supposed to capture the information explained by both the
NVIX and RV. We refer to this model as GARCH–MIDAS with RV+NVIX. In line with our previous findings, we set ωX
1 = 1,
and estimate weighting schemes for RV and NVIX.
2.3. Forecasting performance
One of the commonly cited arguments for using a wide array of forecast error statistics is that there is no consensus on
using a single loss function that is most appropriate for the evaluation of volatility models [26]. Thus, to evaluate the variance
prediction of a specific model, we employ alternative measures of forecast accuracy to six loss functions, root mean squared
prediction error, and root mean absolute error for conditional variance (RMSE and RMAE, respectively), and for standard
deviation (RMSD and RMAD, respectively), along with MMEO and MMEU, as follows:

Patton [27] showed that when using squared returns as a volatility proxy, as we do in our paper, some of the loss functions
are, in fact, not robust. Thus, we further use DM test proposed by Diebold and Mariano [28] to compare the prediction
accuracy of the two competing models. They propose and evaluate explicit tests for the null hypothesis of no difference
in the accuracy of two competing forecasts. In contrast to previously developed tests, a wide variety of accuracy measures
called the DM test can be used when comparing models. Next, we show the many advantages of the DM test. As Diebold and
Mariano [28] show, the DM test has general applicability, when the forecast errors of models can be non-Gaussian, nonzero
mean, serially correlated, and contemporaneously correlated. Further, the framework is obvious and extremely simple. Most
importantly, DM test is applicable under a very wide variety of models and loss structures [29].
3. Data
In this study, we investigate the role ofmonthly NVIX on daily stock market volatility. We obtain G7 stock market indices
from Bloomberg as proxies for developed markets, including the S&P index for the US, FTSE index for the UK, CAC index
for France, DAX index for Germany, FTSEMIB index for Italy, TSX index for Canada, and Nikkei index for Japan. The monthly
NVIX is a text-based uncertainty constructed by Manela and Moreira [8].1 The sample period spans from the first trading day
of January 1998 to the last trading day of March 2016 through our manuscript. Since the trading days of different markets
differ, the observations are different among different countries.
Table 1 reports the summary statistics of daily returns of G7 stock markets, along with the NVIX index. According to unit
root tests, such as the Augment Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) test, the calculated statistics for the daily return
of G7 stock markets and NVIX index are much less than their critical values, indicating that all the variables are stationary. All
the variables are stationary according to unit root test. Meanwhile, the movements of monthly NVIX index data are displayed
in Fig. 1. We observe that NVIX is highly volatile; it shows peaks around the recession periods.
4. Empirical results
In this section, we cover the estimation of GARCH–MIDAS volatility models for the whole sample period. Then, we
consider the return predictability for the GARCH–MIDAS model with RV + NVIX.

4.1. Impact of NVIX on the stock market volatility for the full sample
To evaluate the extent to which volatility is related to NVIX, we include NVIX in the GARCH–MIDAS model. Since RV
is fairly persistent, we include lags of stock market volatility in the model. Table 2 presents the use of full-sample QMLE
parameter estimates of the GARCH–MIDAS models with RV and RV + NVIX.
Before parameter estimation of GARCH–MIDAS models, we need to determine the lag length of RV and NVIX. Based on
previous literature,weassume that 12 is an appropriate lag length for all variables [12,16]. In addition,wecalculate the values
of log-likelihood function (LLF), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for different lag
lengths and find that their values are minimum for a lag length of 12.
First, we note that the results in the table show that almost all parameters are significant. Another interesting feature of
the GARCH–MIDAS model in Table 2 is that the sums of α and β are noticeably less than 1. Though the sum in a standard
GARCH model is typically 1, our results are still within the stationarity boundary, α + β < 1, so the difference will
not influence the results and conclusions, which remain accurate and reliable. This finding is similar to Engle and Rangel
[22], where the sum of mean values of these two parameters is significantly smaller than 1, which indicates that in all
specifications the short-term volatility component mean-reverts to the long-term trend. The estimated α represents the
effect of the past innovation on the conditional volatility and the estimated β represents the volatility persistence effect. All
the estimated α > 0 in Table 2 indicates that the past innovation has positive impacts on the volatility. All the estimated
β < 1 indicates that the log returns of different markets have limited variance and the time series has weak stationarity,
and thus, there are obvious volatility clustering and persistence effects in all the G7 markets.
Next, we take a closer look at the estimates of the long-run component, τt . The sign of θRV indicates the response of
long-run volatility to RVs. The parameter estimates of θNVIX for NVIX range from 0.824 for Canada to 1.752 for the UK. Hence,
in all cases, the parameters are positive and statistically significant, implying that a higher NVIX would bring higher longterm
volatilities, and thus, NVIX could better anticipate long-term volatility in G7 markets. The results mainly reflect that
uncertainty for the US may be ‘‘bad news’’ for developed countries, leading to higher stock volatility.
To assess the economic information content and find out how much of the variation in the expected quarterly variance of
a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model can be attributed to the variation in NVIX, we provide the value of the variance ratio (VR)
statistic proposed by Lo and MacKinlay [30] for each model. By comparing variance estimators derived from data sampled at
different frequencies, they rejected the random walk hypothesis for weekly stock market returns. In general, we define VR as
the fraction of the sample variance of the log of total quarterly conditional volatility, var(log(τ X
t gX
t )), which can be explained
by the sample variance of the log long-term component, var(log(τ X
t )), as follows,
VR(X) =
var(log(τ X
t ))
var(log(τ X
t gX
t ))
(13)
where X refers to a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model. The VR we defined here relates the sample variance of the log of the
long-term component of a specific GARCH–MIDAS-X model to the sample variance of the log of the total expected variance
of the baseline GARCH–MIDAS-RV model with restricted filter [12]. The VR estimates indicate that the long-run volatility
of the MIDAS model with RV + NVIX contributes substantially more than the long-run volatility of the MIDAS model with

RV. The results in Table 3 suggest that NVIX carries information about long-term volatility that is complementary to that
contained in realized volatility. There is also extensive literature applying the variance ratio test to support their idea. Engle
et al. [16] computed the ratio to measure how much of the expected volatility can be explained by economic variables.
Christiansen [31] and Baele [32] obtained a measure of the impact of global, regional, and local volatility-spillover effects on
the local variance from VR. Bastos and Caiado [33] employed variance ratio tests of the random walk hypothesis to investigate
the interdependence of global equity markets in terms of index return predictability. In addition, the finding suggests that,
among all the stock markets, Italy has the most important long-run component contribution – approximately 44% – during
the full sample period. In addition, we observe that the levels of likelihood, the AIC, and BIC of the GARCH–MIDAS model
with RV + NVIX are extremely close to those in the model with RV. The results of the loss functions are not all consistent;
thus, we cannot identify which model performs better. We appraise the forecast performance of RV and RV+NVIX models in
Section 4.2, wherein we revisit this issue.
The variances and long-run volatilities for the GARCH–MIDAS models are plotted in Fig. 2. As expected, the two
components of the models follow a similar trend, although the long-run correlation is smoother. In addition, Fig. 2 implies
a very interesting cyclical pattern in the evolution of long-run volatility. During recession periods, the high NVIX indicates
a volatile macroeconomic policy environment, which dampened investors’ confidence. It further caused the synchronously
steep fall in the stock markets. In addition, we notice that the MIDAS models with RV and NVIX provide a better fit than
those with RV.
4.2. Out-of-sample prediction
The extensive literature on volatility predictability shows that, although the in-sample analysis provides more efficient
parameter estimates, out-of-sample tests seem to be a more relevant standard for assessing genuine predictability in real
time. This is because they implicitly examine the stability of the data-generating process, and guard against in-sample overfitting
[10,15].

Note: The table shows the loss functions of the different models in predicting G7 stock market volatilities. We use two alternative specifications in the
GARCH–MIDAS equation, RV model, and RV + NVIX model. The out-of-sample forecasts cover the period from January 2008 to March 2016.
In this sub-section, we analyze the ability of the GARCH–MIDAS model to forecast variances. Given that the parameters
of the GARCH–MIDAS model may be time-varying, we use a 21-day rolling window to undertake out-of-sample variance
prediction. Our out-of-sample forecast covers the period from January 2008 to March 2016. The initial estimation period
is January 1998 to December 2007, and we use the estimated parameters for this period to forecast variances of the first
21 days in the out-of-sample period. Then, we incorporate the 21 days into the estimation period, and use the estimated
parameters for the new estimation period to forecast variances of the second 21 days in the out-of-sample period. By letting
the window roll forward, we can obtain all the forecasts of variances in the out-of-sample period.
Since GARCH volatility is commonly used in the literature on volatility forecasting, we investigate whether the NVIX
variable can improve the performance of the GARCH–MIDAS model. As Table 4 shows, the stock market volatility forecast
based on the MIDAS models with RV and NVIX produces substantially smaller function values than the forecast based on
the GARCH–MIDAS model with RV in all the loss functions. Furthermore, we present the results of the DM tests for outof-
sample performance of different models in Table 5. In comparison with the RV model, the RV + NVIX models for most
of the loss functions generate positive DM statistics, which are statistically significant and economically large. Hence, our
out-of-sample analysis shows that adding NVIX information to the long-term variance component of the GARCH–MIDAS
model significantly improves the prediction ability of the model.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the impact of NVIX on the stock market volatilities in developed markets by employing a
GARCH–MIDAS model. NVIX is a news-based implied volatility index proposed by Manela and Moreira [8] that measures

Note: The table presents the results of DM tests for out-of-sample performance of the different models in predicting G7 stock market volatilities. The
out-of-sample forecasts cover the period from January 2008 to March 2016. The models in each column all represent the value by subtracting the loss
functions of RV model with function values of the RV + NVIX model for each stock market. Numbers in parentheses are t values of the DM test.
* Indicate significance at the 10% level, according to the DM test.
** Indicate significance at the 5%, level, according to the DM test.
*** Indicate significance at the 1% level, according to the DM test.
uncertainty and disaster concerns. Our empirical results showed that NVIX has a positive and significant influence on the
volatility of all the G7 stock markets, especially for the long-run component. Furthermore, out-of-sample tests showed that
the GARCH–MIDAS model with RV and NVIX outperforms the model with RV. NVIX significantly improve the prediction of
volatilities for the developed markets. The results have implications for market participants, as well as policymakers. First,
this finding implies that when news and investor confidence in US changes, the stock markets in other G7 countries may
experience fluctuations in the future. This confirms the spillover effects of US uncertainty on other developed stock markets.
Therefore, investors in developed markets should pay more attention to the US, which is the main driver of uncertainty and
a key factor in determining market volatilities. With increased efficiency after the financial crisis in 2007–2009, investors
should be aware of the important role of NVIX in asset allocation. They should be careful of the increased volatility of stock
markets in developed countries in periods of uncertainty and can probably consider NVIX to avoid investment risk through
derivatives trading and policy making. Second, our empirical evidence shows that various stock markets in developed
countries will be influenced more or less by the shocks from the US. Policymakers and financial institutions should pay
more attention to the information contained in news related to the US and investors’ concern to decrease the volatility of
markets and manage risk.
