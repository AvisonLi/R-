Purpose: This paper uses data from a 3-arm Cluster Randomized Control Trial, Suubi4Her
(N ¼ 1260; 14e17-year-old school-going girls) to (1) assess the relationship between peer pressure
and adolescent risk-taking behaviors; and (2) test the mediating effect of peer pressure on an
intervention on adolescent risk-taking behaviors.
Methods: Students in the southwestern region of Uganda were assigned to three study arms:
control (n ¼ 16 schools, n ¼ 408 students) receiving usual care comprising of sexual and reproductive
health curriculum; and two active treatment arms: Treatment 1 (n ¼ 16 schools, n ¼ 471
students) received everything the control arm received plus a savings led intervention. Treatment
2 (n ¼ 15 schools, n ¼ 381 students) received everything the control and treatment arms received
plus a family strengthening intervention. We used multilevel models to assess the relationship
between peer pressure and risk-taking behaviors.We ran structural equation models for mediation
analysis.
Results: Using baseline data, we found that direct peer pressure was significantly associated with
substance use risk behaviors, (b ¼ 0.044, 95% CI ¼ 0.008, 0.079). We also found a statistically
significant effect of the intervention on acquiring STIs through the mediating effect of sexual risktaking
significant (b ¼ 0.025, 95% CI: 0.049, 0.001, p ¼ .045) and total indirect (b ¼ 0.042,
95% CI: 0.081, 0.002, p ¼ .037) effects. Also, there was a significant mediation effect of the
intervention on substance use through peer pressure (b ¼ 0.030, 95% CI: 0.057, 0.002,
p ¼ .033).
Discussion: Overall, the study points to the role of peer pressure on adolescent girls’ risk-taking
behaviors; and a need to address peer pressure at an early stage.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
Overall, this study makes a
scientific contribution to
the role of peer pressure
on young adolescent girls’
risk-taking behaviors and
the need to address peer
pressure from an early
childhood development
stage. This is important
because adolescence is a
very challenging period
that requires very targeted
adolescent specific
interventions.
HIV and AIDS remain one of the deadliest pandemics of our
time. Despite global commitments to reduce AIDS-related
deaths, new HIV infections are still emerging [1]. In sub-
Saharan Africa adolescent girls account for one in four new HIV
infections [2]. In 2021, adolescent girls accounted for threequarters
of all new HIV infections among adolescents

[3].Parents in Uganda and much of sub-Saharan Africa invest less
in girls’ economic well-being, including education and economic
resources ownership [4]. Taken as a whole, the lack of investment
in women and young girls (including adolescent girls) impacts
their overall health and well-being [5], hence robbing girls of the
opportunity for an education, contributing to their risk of
acquiring HIV and other risk-taking behaviors [6]. This gender
disparity increases the need to pay attention to the fight against
HIV/AIDS in the region among adolescent girls [7].
Adolescence, typically defined as ages 10e24 [8], is one of the
most challenging periods as it involves multiple transitions:
transition from childhood into adolescence, then from adolescence
into young adulthood (ages 18 and above) with less
parental supervision. Adolescents must juggle school expectations,
parental guidance, the desire to fit in, and succumbing to
peer pressure, defined as the influence of other people to act in a
certain way [9]. Moreover, as children transition through
adolescence, they spend less time with family and more time
with their peers [10].
Peer Pressure can be Direct, defined as an explicit invitation to
do something, such as offering alcohol, or Indirectedefined as the
contribution toward forming an action [11]. Direct peer pressure
may occur as an encouragement to act and offer alcohol. Indirect
peer pressure influences can occur when youth associate with
peers who drink or smoke [12], and being pressured to drink
alcohol [13].
Peer pressure and risk-taking behaviors
Being a member of a peer group is one of the primary experiences
of adolescence [14]. Generally, peer influence leads to
engaging in risky behaviors such as substance use with some
probability of negative consequences such as physical injury,
social rejection, and financial loss [15]. Indeed, peer pressure is
regarded as one of the strongest determinants of juvenile delinquency
[16]. Peer pressure among boys and girls undermines
healthy social norms and HIV prevention messages, including
delaying sexual debut [17]. Moreover, peer pressure may lead to
transactional sexual activities exposing young people to sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) [18].
To illustrate, a study conducted in Indonesia [19] showed a
statistically significant relationship between peer pressure and
sexual behavior among teenagers. Specifically, in the Indonesia
study, the proportion of adolescents who weremotivated to have
sexual intercourse due to peer influence was 26.6%. A similar
study by Wubet [20] located similar resultsdreporting a direct
relationship between peer pressure and the consumption of
alcohol. Peer pressure might build upon a female teenager, and
she ends up leaving school for early marriage, or she decides to
seek a man to fit in a group with her peers, exposing them to
STIs [21].
Peer pressure has also been linked to economic resources.
Specifically, income inequality is associated with risk-taking [22].
Although not all adolescents from low-income families are likely
to fall prey to negative peer influences, economic instability
creates a “fertile ground” for adolescents to be influenced by
peers. Adolescents with no resources may easily be encouraged
to engage with financially stable peers to have a belonging. It is
not uncommon in some peer relationships for peers who are
relatively stable to provide the resources for a peer to acquire
drugs and/or alcohol until one is stable to fund their acquisition
[23]. Moreover, peers may be encouraged by fellow peers to
engage in risk-taking behaviors such as early unprotected sexual
intercourse to gain resources [24]. Thus, economic stability may
play multiple roles in peer pressure influences.
Overall, as detailed above, if not well managed, peer pressure
may lead to several negative consequences [25]. Thus, this study
aims to understand peer pressure during adolescence and how it
relates to risk-taking behaviors among school-going adolescent
girls in Uganda.
Theoretical framework
Two theoretical frameworks guide this study. The first theory
is Bandura`s social learning theory, which posits that development
in human cognition is explained by the interplay of social
beings who hold a need/desire to interact with other
individuals [26]. Specifically, social learning theory is based on
the idea that people learn from interactions with others in a
social context. This can be through observing the behaviors of
others. In the process, people develop similar behaviors, and
after observing, people assimilate or imitate [26]. In the case of
adolescents, in the quest to experience adulthood, they engage in
risk-taking behaviors. Social learning posits that emulating peers’
behavior starts as an experiment and ends in an addiction which,
if not controlled, is problematic to adolescents.
The second theory is Asset theory [27], which posits that
ownership of assets influences people’s behavior. When people
are poor, they are more likely to engage in behaviors that they
would otherwise not engage in if they were more financially
stable. And when people own resources, they are more likely to
be viewed positively. People want to identify with those who
have. In the specific case of this study, one may posit that adolescents
who grow up in poor conditions are more prone to peer
influence. The reasons for this relationship may include low selfesteem
resulting frompoverty and the need for belonging among
peers, who may be perceived to have more resources. In other
words, asset ownership influences people’s behavior but also
influences how people view and interact with others. In this case,
adolescents may be attracted to peers with resources. In addition,
the asset theory states that people with more assets at
present will have more resources in the future. Therefore, if the
family is empowered economically at present, the adolescents in
the family will be more hopeful in the future, and the risk of
engaging in risky behavior such as alcohol consumption, and
unprotected sex would be reduced. Additionally, the psychological
aspect of the theory states that when people have assets,
they fear less and hope more. People develop a positive attitude
towards life which provides a foundation for minimizing risktaking.
Moreover, family strengthening (FS) is shaped by the
does and don’ts of a family that limit children’s behavior in a
family.
Given the theoretical frameworks guiding this study, we
specifically address two questions:
1. What is the role of peer pressure on risk-taking behaviors?
This is an exploratory question for which we offer the
following hypothesis: Adolescent girls who report having peers
who engage in risk-taking behaviors (e.g., sexual risk-taking,
drug use, and alcohol use) will more likely report engaging in
the same behavior themselves.
2. What is the role of peer pressure in mediating the relationship
between a combined intervention (FS plus economic
empowerment (EE) components) and risky behaviors,
F. Namuwonge et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 74 (2024) 130e139 131
including substance use and acquiring STIs? This question will
be addressed using longitudinal data collected at 12- and 24-
months postbaseline.
Methods
Sample
We use data from the longitudinal cluster randomized study
(Suubi4Her study) 2017e2023, funded by the National Institutes
of Mental Health under grant number R01MH113486. The overall
aim of Suubi4Her is to examine an innovative combination
interventionecombining FS and EEeon risk-taking behaviors
among school-going adolescent girls (N ¼ 1260; ages 14e
17 years of age) in Uganda. The recruited girls were attending
their first and second year of senior secondary education (an
equivalent of high school in the US education system) from 47
schools. The schools were in five geopolitical districts in southern
Uganda.
Participant recruitment
To begin, 111 secondary schools were assessed for eligibility
(See Figure 1, consort flow diagram). Out of 111 schools assessed,
Figure 1. Consort flow diagram.
F. 132 Namuwonge et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 74 (2024) 130e139
65 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, leaving a
total of 47 Schools. The remaining 47 schools were included in
the study based on their school size (total number of students
enrolled), location (urban vs. rural), and overall performance
based on the Uganda Certificate of Education examinations results.
All included schools had to be registered by the Uganda
Government’s Ministry of Education and Sports. For details on
recruitment, see study protocol paper [7].
Randomization. Following school selection, students were
randomly assigned to three study conditions at the school level
(N ¼ 47 secondary schools): a control arm (n ¼ 16 schools, n ¼
408 students) receiving usual care comprising of sexual and
reproductive health curriculum delivered in school and school
supplies (textbooks and notebooks); and two active treatment
arms. Treatment 1 (n ¼ 16 schools, n ¼ 471 students) received
everything the control arm received plus a savings-led EE
Intervention [(financial literacy training and a Youth Development
Accounts (YDA)]. Treatment 2 (n ¼ 15 schools, n ¼ 381
students received everything the control and treatment arm one
received plus a FS intervention (comprising a multiple family
group (MFG) intervention). See details on the intervention below.
The first intervention arm consisted of YDA, with a 1:1
matched savings program. The matched saving account was
opened in the adolescent’s name with her primary caregiver as a
cosigner (required until age 18 years). The match was saved on a
different account. At the time when payment for school fees is
required, a direct wire transfer was made to the school, or a
cheque using the matched funds were paid directly to the school.
This process eliminates unwanted pressure to withdraw funds
that were designated for the girl’s education and skills development.
A maximum of 70% was used on education and skills
development and 30% for investment in family-based incomegenerating
activities.
The second intervention condition consisted of an innovative
combination of YDA and FS intervention delivered through
MFGs. This intervention was a manualized curriculum that integrated
aspects of group therapy, family support, systemic
family therapy, and behavioral parent training delivered through
16 sessions. Specifically, the intervention focused on the ‘‘4 Rs’’:
Rules, Responsibility, Relationships, and Respectful communication,
plus factors related to family engagement in mental
health services under the ‘‘2Ss’’: Stress and Social support.
Trained Community Health Workers and Parent Peers delivered
the MFG intervention. The MFG approach opens an opportunity
for adolescents and their families to share their experiences with
others in similar situations, thus building hope by providing
social support, normalization of similar experiences and struggles,
and the sharing of effective solutions [28].
The third study condition consisted of Usual Care. Participants
in all study conditions received the required Adolescent Sexual
and Reproductive Health curriculum, which provides information
relating to HIV and sexual risk-taking behavior.
Data was collected using a 90-minute intervieweradministered
survey.
Study measures
Outcome variables. Risk-taking behaviors were measured using
two indicators: sexual risk-taking behaviors and substance use
(including the use of alcohol, use of tobacco, and use of drugs).
Sexual risk-taking behavior was assessed by: (1) self-reported
question: “Have you ever had sexual intercourse?” with responses
(yes ¼ 1 vs. no ¼ 0). (2). Biomarkers tests for pregnancy/
HCG test (positive ¼ 1 vs. negative ¼ 0), and laboratoryconfirmed
STIs (positive ¼ 1 vs. negative ¼ 0) were captured at
baseline. The STIs assessed in the study were Chlamydia,
Gonorrhea, and Trichomonas. Because of the COVID-19 restrictions
that included no personal contact, biomarkers were
only captured at baseline and 12 months. The items were added
to generate a total score for sexual risk-taking behavior, with
higher scores showing more sexual risk-taking behaviors.
Substance use was assessed by asking the participants about
their alcohol, cigarette smoking, and marijuana use behaviors.
Specifically, participants were asked if they had ever had a drink
of alcohol other than a few sips (yes ¼ 1 vs. no ¼ 0). 2) Cigarette
smokingwas also self-reported. Participants were asked whether
they had ever tried cigarette smoking, even one or two puffs
(yes ¼ 1 vs. no ¼ 0). Additionally, participants were asked if they
had ever taken marijuana (yes ¼ 1 vs. no ¼ 0). The items were
added to generate a score for substance use. Higher scores
indicated that the adolescents indulged more in substance use.
Predictor variables
Sexual-risk taking attitudes. Sexual-risk-taking attitudes were
measured using a 5-item scale, with each statement rated on a 5-
point Likert scale ranging from “Never ¼ 1” to “Always ¼ 5”.
Participants were asked how each of the statements applied to
them. Sample statements include: I believe it’s OK for people my
age to have sex with someone they’ve just met; I believe it’s OK
for people my age to have sex with someone they love; I believe
it’s OK to have sex without protection with someone you know.
Theoretical scores range from 5 to 25 (Cronbach alpha ¼ 0.72),
with a higher score indicating higher levels of sexual risk-taking
attitudes.
Peer pressure. We assessed both direct peer pressure and indirect
peer pressure. Four questions measured direct peer pressure,
including (1) How much do you feel peer pressure to smoke
cigarettes? (2) How often do you feel peer pressure to drink
alcohol? (3) How much do you feel peer pressure to have a
romantic partner? and (4) Howoften do you feel peer pressure to
smoke marijuana? Each question was rated on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 ¼ never to 5 ¼ always. Items were recoded
further to 1 ¼ 0 and 2e5 ¼ 1. Summated scores were obtained
and then categorized into two: (1) participants who scored
0 were considered not to have peer pressure and were coded
with 0 and (2) participants who scored one and above were
considered to have peer pressure and were coded with 1. Four
questions also assessed indirect peer pressure. These were: (1)
How much peer pressure is there on people your age to smoke
cigarettes? (2) How much peer pressure is there on people of
your age to drink alcohol? (3) How much peer pressure is there
on people of your age to have sex? and (4) How much peer
pressure is there on people your age to smoke marijuana? Each
question was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ¼
None to 5 ¼ A great deal. Items were further recoded as 1 ¼0, and
2e5 ¼ 1. Summated scores were obtained, with higher values
suggesting more peer pressure.
Individual level factors. These included the participant’s age, and
orphanhood status (double orphan vs. single orphan vs. nonorphan).
In addition, we include self-esteem in this block. We
F. Namuwonge et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 74 (2024) 130e139 133
define self-esteem as the self-evaluation of one’s self-worth [29]
and we measured it using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, a 10-
item scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree to 4 ¼ strongly agree). Theoretical
scores range from 10 to 40 (Cronbach alpha ¼ 0.77), with
higher scores indicating high levels of self-esteem.
Family level factors. These included: (1) Primary caregiver (biological
parents, grandparents, other relatives). (2) Socioeconomic
status, measured using employment status by asking the
following question: “Is the person who financially supports you
currently employed in the formal sector and earning a salary or a
wage?” (1 ¼ yes vs. 0 ¼ no); and total household assetsdassessed
by a 20-item index in which participants were asked, “Does the
family you live in own the following: house, rentals, land, banana
plantation, coffee plantation, car, bicycle, or television?”. The total
number of assets was summed up and then categorized into two;
low-asset possession and high-asset possession. We used the
World Bank [30] suggested cutoff at the 40th percentile to
represent low asset possession. (3) We also assessed (1) participant’s
possession of essential household items using three variables:
sets of clothes (1 or fewer ¼ 0 vs. Two or more ¼ 1); pairs
of shoes (1 or fewer ¼ 0 vs. Two or more ¼ 1); and blanket
ownership (yes ¼ 1 vs. no ¼ 0). The items were added and
categorized into two categories: participants who owned one or
fewer essential items were coded as 0 and, participants who
owned two or more essential items were coded as one; (2) Food
security was assessed using six questions: number of meals per
day (1 or fewer ¼ 0 vs. Two or more ¼ 1); frequency of eating
meat or fish in the prior week (1 or fewer ¼ 0 vs. Two or more ¼
1); frequency of eating egg(s) in the previous week (1 or fewer ¼
0 vs. Two or more ¼ 1); frequency of taking milk in the previous
week (1 or fewer ¼ 0 vs. Two or more ¼ 1); having breakfast on
the day of interview yes ¼ 1 vs. no ¼ 0); and frequency of taking
tea with sugar (1 or fewer ¼ 0 vs. Two or more ¼ 1). The same
questions have been used in other studies to assess food security.
(4) Number of people in the household; (5) Number of children in
the household.
Data analysis procedure
Data were analyzed using Stata software version SE 17 (aim 1)
and Mplus (aim 2). We summarized continuous variables using
means, standard deviations, and categorical variables using
percentages. The first study aim assessed for the association
between peer pressure and two outcomes including sexual risktaking
behaviors and substance use risk behaviors. To answer
this aim, we used baseline data and fitted a separate multilevel
linear regression model for each outcome. In each model, the
participants comprised level 1 of the model, and these were
clustered under the schools, which we included in level 2. We
examined the models to and determined that the residuals were
normally distributed, there was homoskedasticity, and no multicollinearity
was detected. We performed sensitivity analyses
including allowing random slopes for several variables such as
age and peer pressure, and cross-level interaction; however,
these models reported comparable results. We reported b coefficients
and their Huber-White cluster-adjusted confidence
intervals (CIs), in which we adjusted for clustering at the school
level. We also reported random effects including the variance of
the school and participant random intercepts, variance of the
residuals, and the intraclass correlation coefficients for the
school and participant levels. Statistical significance was
assessed at 0.05 level.
To assess the mediation pathways for the relationship between
the intervention and the two outcomes (substance use
behaviors and acquiring STIs), we fitted separate multilevel
generalized structural equation models, by including the school
as a clustering variable, using Mplus version 8.1 [31]. To preserve
the temporal trend of events, we used direct peer-pressure
(mediator) that was assessed at 12 months and outcomesd
including substance use and acquiring STIs assessed at
24 months post intervention initiation. In all the models, we
controlled for the participants’ age. During the Structural Equation
Model (SEM) analysis, estimation of the model was conducted
using Weighted Least Squares, Mean and Variance
adjusted. This method is particularly effective for categorical and
ordinal dependent variables. ’STIs’ was classified as a categorical
variable, while ’Substance Use’ was considered a continuous
variable. This decisionwas based on the inherent nature of these
variables, thereby enabling us to maintain the accuracy and
validity of our results. To deal with missing data, we employed
the Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation under the
assumption of data missing at random. This approach makes use
of all available data, resulting in unbiased parameter estimates
when the data are missing at random. Furthermore, we used
bootstrapping with 5000 draws to produce robust standard errors
and CIs. We also implemented delta parameterization
coupled with a probit link function to model the categorical
nature of some variables in our models. In all the models, we
controlled for the participant age.
We reported the standardized coefficients (b) with the corresponding
95% CIs based on a ¼ 0.05. The goodness of fit of the
SEM was assessed using (1) overall chi-squaredwhere a
nonsignificant p value would suggest good model fit, (2) Root
Mean Square Error of Approximation below 0.06, (3) Standardized
Root Mean Square Residual below 0.08 and (4) Comparative
Fit Index above 0.90 (Gunzler et al., 2013) In the SEM, we estimated
the total, direct, and indirect effect (through peer pressure)
of the intervention on sexual risk-taking behaviors. In the
models, the direct effect is denoted c’ and is the effect of the
intervention on the outcome after controlling for the mediators.
The indirect effect (a*b) is the effect of the intervention to the
outcome through the mediators. The total effect, c, is the sum of
the direct and indirect effects of the intervention on the outcome
(c ¼ c’ þ a*b) [31] We also determined the total effect that was
mediated.We also calculated the percent mediated as the ratio of
the indirect effect to the total effect as shown. [Percent
Mediated ¼ (Indirect Effect/Total Effect) * 100%].
Ethical considerations
The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the
Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board
(IRB) and by in-country local IRBs in Uganda, including the
Uganda Virus Research Institute-Research Ethics committee and
the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology. Written
informed consent was obtained from the caretakers, and the
children provided assent prior to participating in the study. To
ensure the integrity of the consent process, the forms were
translated and back translated between English and Luganda. To
avoid any potential coercion, the consent process for adult
caregivers and children was conducted separately. In accordance
F. 134 Namuwonge et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 74 (2024) 130e139
with the Uganda HIV disclosure policy, study participants
received their HIV results independently of their caregivers.
Results
Sample characteristics
Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of the
sample. Specifically, the mean age was 15.4 years. About 83% of
participants were nonorphans, and 76.6% identified a biological
parent as their primary caregiver. The average number of people
in the household was 7, with an average of three children living
in the household. Only 23.2% of the participants reported that the
person financially supporting them is employed in the formal
sector. Almost 50% of the participating adolescents reported
experiencing some form of peer pressuredspecifically, 26% reported
experiencing direct peer pressure, while 25.1% experienced
indirect peer pressure to engage in risky behaviors.
We find that 3.3% of participants reported prior sexual intercourse,
and 1.1% tested positive on the HCG test. Less than 1%
of participants tested positive for Chlamydia, and 5.2% tested
positive for Trichomonas. In regard to substance use, 5.9% of
participants reported having had a drink of alcohol other than a
few sips, 1.2% reported ever smoking cigarettes, and 0.24% had
tried using Marijuana.
Research question #1. What is the relationship between peer
pressure and risk-taking behaviors (sexual risk-taking behaviors
and substance use risk behaviors)? This question was addressed
using baseline results.
Table 2 presents the relationship between peer pressure and
risk-taking behaviors.
Sexual risk-taking behaviors
We found that direct and indirect peer pressure were not
associated with sexual risk-taking behaviors. However, we found
other factors that were associated with this outcome. For
instance, increasing age was significantly associated with a
higher likelihood of engaging in sexual risk-taking behaviors.
Specifically, for every year increase in a participant’s age, the
likelihood of engaging in sexual risk-taking behavior increases by
0.052 (b ¼ 0.052; 95% CI ¼ 0.013e0.090). We also find that for
every unit increase in food security, the likelihood of engaging in
sexual risk-taking behavior decreased by 0.032 (b ¼0.032, 95%
CI ¼ 0.056 to 0.008).
Substance use risky behavior
Participants from a household where the person financially
supporting the family was employed in the formal sector, were
more likely to engage in substance use risky behaviors than the
participants with a financial supporter who is not currently
employed in a formal sector (b ¼ 0.039; 95% CI ¼ 0.002e0.075).
We also found that the participants who experienced direct peer
pressure were more likely to engage in in substance use risktaking
behaviors than participants who did not experience
direct peer pressure (b ¼ 0.044, 95% CI ¼ 0.008e0.079).
Research question #2. The second question explores the role of
peer in mediating the relationship between Suubi4Her combination
intervention and STI acquisition and substance use
behaviors. This questionwas addressed using threewaves of data
collected at baseline, 12- and 24-months postbaseline.
See Figure 2.
Sexual risk-taking behaviors
In our analysis on mediators for the effect of the intervention
on STIs, a significant mediation effect was observed through
sexual risk-taking attitudes. More precisely, the interventionwas
effective in decreasing these attitudes, which subsequently led to
a reduction in the likelihood of acquiring STIs. This mediation
effect was evidenced by significant specific indirect (b ¼0.025,
95% CI: 0.049, 0.001, p ¼ .045) and total indirect (b¼ 0.042,
95% CI: 0.081, 0.002, p ¼ .037) effects. Importantly, no significant
direct effect or total effect of the intervention on STIswas
detected. The mediation analysis revealed that 51.9% of the total
effect was mediated through sexual risk-taking attitudes, further
underlining the importance of this indirect pathway. However,
we found that peer pressure did not significantly mediate the
impact of the intervention on STIs. These findings are detailed in
Table 3 and Figure 2.
Substance use risky behavior
Regarding substance use, we found a significant mediation
effect, indicating that the intervention influenced substance use
indirectly through its impact on peer pressure. More specifically,
our intervention was found to decrease peer pressure, which in
turn, led to a reduction in substance use. The specific indirect
effect of this mediating relationship was significant (b¼0.030,

(b ¼ 0.030, 95% CI: 0.057, 0.002, p ¼ .033). These findings
highlight the role of peer pressure in influencing substance use
among the study participants. However, it’s worth noting that
the direct effect of the intervention on substance use, as well as
the total effect of the intervention on substance use, was not
statistically significant. In this model, 10.2% of the total effect was
mediated.
Discussion
This paper investigated the role of peer pressure on risktaking
behaviors and the role of peer pressure in mediating the
relationship between a combined intervention (FS plus EE
components) and risky behaviors.
Results indicated that as adolescents grow in age, the likely
hood of engaging in sexual risk taking behaviors increase. Indeed
as young people transition into adolescence, they tend to move
more toward their peersdseeking acceptance by their peers.
This may lead to young people being more susceptible to the
influences of their peers, including increased risk-taking behaviors.
Parental monitoring and supervision are powerful influences
in the life of an adolescent. With reduced parental
supervision, adolescents are more likely to engage in risk-taking
behaviors, including having unprotected sex, alcohol use, and
drug use. Moreover, the transition through adolescence comes
with different physical changes, including changes in moods,
hormonal levels, and increased curiosity. Adolescence is associated
with poor mental health [32]. Some adolescents engage in
risk-taking behaviors because it is considered a way of escaping
challenges and depression.
Food insecurity is an essential driver of vulnerability. This
study finds that adolescents reporting food security are less
likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors. Indeed, adolescent girls
tend to engage in risk-taking behaviors, including transaction sex
work, because they desire to meet their basic needs, including
food.
These results align with what Ogunsola mentions that having
parents with full employment is a determinant of substance use
in adolescents [33]. In addition, parents with tertiary education
are another risk factor for engaging in substance use [34]. Adolescents
from families with formal employment live in households
with a stable flow of income, which may increase their
chances of access to resources that could be used to engage in
risky activities such as buying alcohol and drugs. Moreover,
formal employment may mean that caregivers/families spend
more time away from home, which may reduce parental-child
supervision and monitoring, allowing adolescents to spend
most of the time with their peers and being influenced by the
same group. Again, these are simply logical speculations.
We found a statistically significant effect of the intervention
in decreasing these attitudes sexual risk-taking attitudes and a
decrease in peer pressure, which in turn, led to a reduction in
substance use. The results align well with a study conducted by
Ssewamala [35] that confirms the importance of economic
intervention in protecting adolescents from sexual risk-taking
behaviors, and in this case through reduced peer pressure. EE
brings about a positive outlook for the future, Participants are
less likely to be influenced by their peers to engage in behavior

that can jeopardize their future, including avoiding risky sexual
behaviors [24,36]. Moreover, Brathwaite [37], mentions that
economic interventions are protective measures against alcohol
and drug use.
The study employed a combination intervention, the EE
component was complimented by a family-level intervention for
effective interventions, this combination brought together families
to pull resources together to save money and meet their
specific needs. Sessions improved family communication and
relations, and when families are empowered to work as a unit
most of the emotional, social, and economic challenges are easily
overcome. Hence, a buffer to engaging in sexual risk-taking
behaviors.
Implications
Overall, this study points to the role of peer pressure on young
adolescent girls’ risk-taking behaviors and the need to address
peer pressure from an early childhood development stage.
Dealing with peer pressure is a skill that adolescents need.
There should be systems to support adolescents through the
challenges they face. In most cases, children will relate with
Figure 2. SEM diagram for the mediators of the effect of an economic empowerment intervention on risky behaviors. In the first model (Model 1), the outcome was
having a sexually transmitted infection, which was measured as an observed variable. In the second model (Model 2), the outcome was substance use behaviors, that
was measured as a latent variable. Model two did not include sexual risk-taking attitudes as a mediator, which was only included in model 1. In the models, the
mediators used including peer pressure and sexual risk-taking were measured at 12 months, while the outcomes were measured at 24 months.

peers on issues they find inappropriate to involve their parents.
Nevertheless, caregivers/parents can create conducive environments
to allow their children to gain trust and discuss issues they
would otherwise not discuss with them. As adolescents find
support in their parents and families, this serves as a buffer to
engaging in risky behaviors and a control mechanism to check
the kind of relationships and networks their children/adolescents
relate with. Institutions like families and schools should
talk about the negative components of peer pressure through
peer education, and safe spaces. Peer education is a useful tool to
deal with adolescent challenges [38] and can be implemented
with cultural sensitivity in mind.
Additionally, intervention tools such as the friendship bench
[39], where adolescents can speak freely to trained community
members, similar to what has been done in Zimbabwe, Malawi,
and Botswana, could be employed. The friendship bench is a
culturally sensitive tool that appreciates local relationship dynamics.
This could potentially make it a more effective tool for
addressing peer education.
It is essential to increase interventions that increase economic
security in young people because these serve as a buffer to sexual
risk-taking behaviors and encourage youth to stay in school. Also,
policymakers are called upon to integrate financial capability
policies into youth development policies Further, research is
needed to study the negative impacts of owning resources at an
early age.
Limitations
The study conducted Biomarkers once a year, there is a possibility
that we could have missed some infection windows,
especially if participants received treatment and the illness is
treated between the assessment intervalsdalthough there is no
free STI treatment especially for low-income school-going adolescents
like the ones included in our study.
Further, not all peer pressure is negative; this research did not
test the positive impact of peer pressure in terms of developmental
influence. For example, when it comes to schooling, the
positive aspect of peer pressure may posit that students learn a
lot from their peers through discussion groups and may solve
problematic questions in class [40]. Moreover, as one aspect of
the positives of peer pressure, weak students (in this case, peers)
may be supported by their colleagues to improve their class
grades; and peers with good grades can also motivate others to
perform better. Indeed, some students learn more from their
peers than their teachers in class. Sometimes peer pressure on
college students may positively affect them [41]. When they stay
in a peer group, they will compare to others automatically. Thus,
one cannot ignore the positive contribution of peer pressure on
school and education attainment among adolescents.
Lastly, our findings are not generalizable to out-of-school
adolescent girls especially at the time of recruitment. The study
focused on in school adolescent girls and yet those out of school
may be at higher risk of sexual risk-taking.
Overall, it is important to emphasize that the study is unique
given its assessment of multiple outcomes of peer pressure in
adolescent girls. Specifically, the study combines self-reports and
biological data to link peer pressure and risk behaviors,
strengthening the analysis. Despite the study’s limitations, the
highlighted findings contribute to the existing literature on the
relationship between peer pressure and risk-taking behaviors.
