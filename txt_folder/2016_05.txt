Abstract
Peripheral insulin resistance is a key component of metabolic syndrome associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2
diabetes. While the impact of insulin resistance is well recognized in the periphery, it is also becoming apparent in the brain. Recent studies
suggest that insulin resistance may be a factor in brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) whereby intranasal insulin therapy, which delivers
insulin to the brain, improves cognition and memory in AD patients. Here, we tested a clinically relevant delivery method to determine the
impact of two forms of insulin, short-acting insulin lispro (Humalog) or long-acting insulin detemir (Levemir), on cognitive functions in
aged F344 rats. We also explored insulin effects on the Ca2+-dependent hippocampal afterhyperpolarization (AHP), a well-characterized
neurophysiological marker of aging which is increased in the aged, memory impaired animal. Low-dose intranasal insulin improved memory
recall in aged animals such that their performance was similar to that seen in younger animals. Further, because ex vivo insulin also reduced
the AHP, our results suggest that the AHP may be a novel cellular target of insulin in the brain, and improved cognitive performance following
intranasal insulin therapy may be the result of insulin actions on the AHP.
Key Words: Calcium—Type 2 diabetes—Neuronal excitability—Memory—Afterhyperpolarization
Results from preclinical settings argue that peripheral insulin
resistance, a component of type 2 diabetes and/or the metabolic
syndrome, may have a negative impact on cognitive function.
Emerging studies report that in diabetic models, insulin responses
are attenuated in the brain, possibly indicating the presence of insulin
resistance in this tissue. Clinical and preclinical studies show
that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors, their
message and their function, are often reduced in the hippocampus
during normal and pathological aging (1–6). Similarly, in animal
models of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), brain insulin receptor
signaling is reduced, often in the presence of peripheral metabolic
dysregulation (7–14). Importantly, several studies provide
evidence that brain insulin therapy can greatly reduce cognitive
decline with age and/or AD, and even improve memory in young
adults [reviewed in ref. (15)].
In recent studies examining the effects of insulin on cognition,
insulin has been administered via the intranasal route to bypass the
blood brain barrier. Notably, Born and colleagues (16) have shown
that intranasal insulin is capable of entering the human brain rapidly.
However, the underlying mechanism(s) leading to cognitive
improvement are not yet clear. Potential molecular/cellular targets
affected by insulin in the brain and capable of offsetting cognitive
decline include changes in neuronal firing (17), Ca2+-dependent K+
channels (18), GABA currents (19) and tau and Aβ metabolism
(20–22). Insulin also alters synaptic structures (23,24), modifies synaptic
plasticity (25–27) and increases delivery of NMDA receptors
to the plasma membrane (28). Similar effects have been observed in
response to IGF-1 replacement, showing increased AMPA-mediated
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (29,30), and increased NMDA
receptor trafficking (31), effects that appear capable of offseting

age-dependent cognitive decline (32). Further, MRI data in men and
women has provided evidence that intranasal insulin can have an
impact on brain blood flow (33), and on whole-body insulin sensitivity
via regulation of hypothalamic activity (34,35). Whether this
later effect is purely mediated by central insulin effects or reflects
permeation of small insulin amounts into the bloodstream is currently
being investigated (36–38).
Another important candidate mechanism that may underlie the
effects of intranasal insulin pertains to Ca2+ homeostasis. Ca2+ dysregulation
is prominent in models of diabetes (39). In the dorsal root
ganglion and the hippocampus of animals with STZ-induced diabetes
(40,41), broader Ca2+ action potentials, larger Ca2+-dependent
afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), and aberrant intracellular Ca2+
release are seen (40,42,43). Impaired memory and long-term potentiation
maintenance is also present (44). Clinical data also supports
a role for Ca2+ dysregulation in peripheral insulin resistance as evidenced
by the presence of abnormal and sustained adipocyte Ca2+
elevations in hyperinsulinemic, obese subjects (45). Similar evidence
for an increase in Ca2+ levels in skin fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics
has also been reported (46). In recent work, we have shown that
the Ca2+-dependent AHP, which increases in amplitude and duration
with aging (47–49), is sensitive to insulin (ex vivo), and that this
sensitivity is reduced by a high fat diet (50).
While some studies in humans demonstrate the efficacy of intranasal
insulin as a cognitive enhancer, studies in animal models are
required to understand the potential mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of intranasal insulin. However, only one prior study
has measured the impact of intranasal insulin on brain function in
the awake animal, focusing on olfactory discrimination in the young
mouse (51). Because the greatest risk factor for AD is aging, research
into how central nervous system insulin signaling affects brain aging
may improve understanding of the biological conditions. Further,
because of the sustained growth in the aging population, implementing
strategies to reduce the impact of brain aging will likely benefit
the aging population, and by extension, may reduce the incidence
of age-related neurodegenerative diseases that share cellular mechanisms
with brain aging (eg, AD).
We, therefore, assessed learning and memory performance
in aged rats in response to two different insulin formulations
(short-acting insulin Humalog and long-acting insulin Levemir),
and quantified Ca2+ homeostasis. Insulin is available primarily
in shorter- and longer-acting forms, and intranasal longer-acting
insulin formulations (eg, Levemir) may potentially be superior to
shorter-acting ones (eg, Humalog) especially in APOE-ε4 carriers
(52). In addition, because insulin is often formulated with zinc, to
more specifically address the impact of insulin, we studied a zincfree
insulin formulation (Apidra), as well as zinc alone on the AHP.
Overall, our goals were to test whether intranasal insulin could
reduce cognitive decline in aged animals, as well as redress the
accompanying neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation seen in the hippocampus
of aged animals.
Methods
Animals
Young male F344 (3 months old), aged male F344 (21 months old),
and young male Sprague-Dawley rats (2–6 months old) were used
for this study. Young F344 animals were not treated with insulin,
and were used to help gauge the impact of intranasal insulin on
memory function in aged F344. All animals were fed an 18% protein
rodent diet (Harlan Teklad, diet #2018; Madison, WI).
In Vivo Insulin Delivery and Doses
Levemir doses were approximately 0.0715, 0.143, or 0.286 IU/
day/rat delivered in two 5 μL applications applied to the tip of the
right naris using a P10 Eppendorf pipette (Supplementary Figure 1)
[adapted from (53)]. Humalog dose was chosen to deliver 0.0715
IU/day/rat for behavioral characterization. An intranasal 0.286 IU/
rat dose was also administered once to aged animals (n = 3) to monitor
the impact on peripheral glucose (Supplementary Table 1). Each
application was separated by 1 minute, during which the animal was
held supine and immobile in a DecapiCone (Braintree Scientific Inc.,
Braintree, MA). Each animal was acclimated to this procedure for
4 days prior to initiation of the Morris water maze protocol. All animal
groups were exposed to the DecapiCone for the same duration,
and no signs of stress from the bagging procedure were noted. The
insulin doses were chosen to approximate several clinically relevant
doses used in past studies ranging from 10 to 40 IU/day and were
adjusted by brain weights. Assuming a 70-year old human brain
weighs 1,360 g (54), 10, 20, and 40 IU/day are equivalent to 0.0074,
0.0147, and 0.0294 IU/day/g of brain, respectively. Assuming a
21-month old F344 brain weighs 2.06 g (55), our equivalent doses
were 0.035, 0.069, and 0.138 IU/day/g of brain. It should be noted
that these values may underestimate final insulin concentration given
the greater olfactory epithelium surface in the nasal passages of the
rat (50%), compared to man [8% (56)]. Insulin solutions were made
fresh weekly from 100 U/mL vials (Humalog, insulin lispro, Lilly;
Levemir, insulin detemir, Novo Nordisk) and diluted into sterile
0.9% saline.
Blood Glucose Levels
To ensure that the intranasal delivery did not result in reduced
peripheral glucose levels, and to test whether stress from the acute
restraint procedures (DecapiCone) could elevate blood glucose levels,
we measured blood glucose (FreeStyle Lite glucometer; Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) from dorsal tail veins in a subset of
aged animals either exposed to intranasal Levemir (n = 5 from each
treatment group) or Humalog (n = 3), both before and approximately
1 hour after dosing (Supplementary Table 1).
Animal Behavior, Treatment Groups and Morris
Water Maze Procedures
Two cohorts of F344 animals were used for behavioral characterization
(Supplementary Figure 1B). One cohort of animals (n = 50)
was used to test the impact of long-acting insulin Levemir at three
different doses (low, medium, and high; n = 10 per group) compared
with an intranasal saline young group (3 months; n = 10)
and an intranasal saline aged group (21 months old; n = 10). A second
cohort of aged animals (n = 20) was used to test the impact of
short-acting insulin Humalog against saline (n = 10 per group). For
analysis, behavioral data from the two aged saline control groups
in both cohorts were combined because memory performance on
probe day was similar (path length to goal, p = .89 and cumulative
search error, p = .913). One aged animal in the saline group died during
acclimation prior to initiation of behavioral testing. The remaining
69 animals where trained on the Morris water maze (MWM).
Animals were considered visually impaired or unable to learn the
task if they could not find the platform on all three of the trials on
the cue day (visual platform) and at least one of the remaining three
training days. Based on these conditions, two aged Humalog animals
and three aged low-dose Levemir animals were removed from the
analysis. Behavioral results are therefore presented on 64 animals,

10 young saline, 19 aged saline, 8 aged low-dose humalog (10 IU/
day), 7 aged low-dose Levemir (10 IU/day), 10 aged medium-dose
Levemir (20 IU/day), and 10 aged high-dose Levemir (40 IU/day).
On cue day, no significant differences were found across any of the
groups on measures of path length (one-way ANOVA, p > .05) and
swim speed across insulin dose (one-way ANOVA, post hoc p > .05),
indicating motivation and motor activity were likely similar.
Insulin or saline treatment in both cohorts was initiated 4 days
prior to the initiation of training (Supplementary Figure 1B) and was
delivered 1–3 hours before testing on the MWM. The MWM protocol
has been published elsewhere (50,57), but briefly, water temperature
was maintained at 26°C –27°C, and black liquid tempera paint
was used to make the water opaque and hide the submerged escape
platform (~1.5 cm below water surface). A Videomex-V acquisition
system and water maze analysis software (version 4.64, Columbus
Instruments, Columbus, OH) were used to track and measure animal
movements. Animals were allowed 60 seconds to find the platform,
after which they were guided to it. Each animal stayed on the
platform for 30 seconds before returning to a heated holding chamber
for about 2 minutes. On cue day, a white cup hanging above
the partially submerged platform helped orient the animals. Animals
were subjected to three trials per day (semi-random drop location
for each trial) for cue and training days. Twenty-four hours after
the last training day, a probe trial was initiated with the platform
removed (60 seconds max swim time). Swim speed was derived from
the distance travelled over time on the last trial of the third training
day and on the first trial of the cue day. On all cue and training days
the intertrial interval was approximately 150 seconds. All behavioral
experiments were conducted with the experimenters blind to the
treatment groups using color coding of the insulin and saline vials.
Electrophysiology
Hippocampal slices were used across two electrophysiological setups,
one monitoring extracellular field potentials and, the other measuring
intracellular potentials (eg, AHP). All data were acquired using
pClamp 8.0 (Molecular Devices MDS, Toronto, Canada) through a
Digidata 1320A A/D converter (Molecular Devices). Potentials (eg,
amplitude and duration of AHPs, field EPSPs) were quantified offline
using Clampfit (Molecular Devices). Nineteen of the 20 behaviorally
characterized aged animals (second cohort used to test the
impact of short-acting insulin Humalog against saline) were used
2–5 weeks after the last day of behavioral characterization to determine
the impact of single intranasal insulin dose in vivo. From those,
a total of 30 slices used for extracellular field potential recordings
(Figure 2D and E) and 13 cells used for intracellular recordings
(Figure 2B and C) were used for statistical analyses and are presented
using an n of 1 per cell/slice. In data presented in Figure 3,
16 Sprague-Dawley animals (2–6 months old) were used to monitor
the impact of zinc and Humalog ex vivo both extracellularly and
intracellularly (30 slices and 23 cells, respectively). Work presented
in Figure 4 (intracellular physiology only) is compiled from a total of
17 F344 male rats split into young (n = 8; 3 months) and aged (n = 9;
22 months). This last group of animals yielded recordings from six
cells for young artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (ACSF), eight cells from
young Apidra, six cells for aged ACSF, and five cells for aged Apidra.
Field potentials
Rats were anesthetized with Isoflurane prior to decapitation. Brains
were quickly removed and placed in oxygenated ACSF of the following
composition (in mM): 114 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 1.25
KH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 8 MgCl2, and 0.1 CaCl2. Hippocampi were
sectioned (coronal) with a Vibratome 3000 (Bannockburn, IL) set at
400 μm. Slices were transferred to an interface-type recording chamber
(static) containing oxygenated recording ACSF of the following
composition (in mM): 114 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 1.25 KH2PO4,
26 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, and 1.3 MgCl2. The recording chamber was
kept at 32°C and warm moist 95% O2 and 5% CO2 was continually
delivered to the chamber. Bipolar synaptic stimulation was delivered
through a SD9K stimulator (Astro Med Inc., Grass Instr., Warwick,
RI). Input/output curves (I/O) were recorded using a series of
increasing voltage steps. The relationship between stimulus intensity
and EPSP amplitudes (prior to dendritic spike contamination) was
fit (linear, r2 > .9) to yield a measure on the slope of the I/O. Data are
also reported as the absolute amplitudes of the EPSPs measured as
the maximum deflection from baseline. Insulin (1, 100, and 500 nM
Humalog) and/or zinc treatment (130 nM—see AHP-Intracellular
Recordings section) under these conditions was initiated 1 hour after
placing the slices in the chamber (compounds remained in the chamber
for the duration of the experiment.
AHP-Intracellular Recordings
Hippocampal slices (350 μm) were transferred from the static chamber
and placed in a perfusion chamber (RC22C, Warner Instruments,
Co., Hamden, CT) and maintained in a continuous flow of oxygenated
ACSF preheated at 32°C using a TC2Bip/HPRE2 in-line heating
system (Cell Micro Controls, Northfolk, VA). The ACSF contained
2 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM MgCl2 and in some experiments (Figure 4
only), the traditional 10 mM glucose concentration was replaced
with 4.5 mM glucose. This was done to test whether higher glucose
concentrations altered insulin sensitivity. We chose 4.5 mM to help
maintain tissue health and physiology for extended hours (58), to
approximate values in anesthetized preparations (59), and to consider
fluctuations in brain glucose levels across a day (60). As previously
described, cells were impaled with sharp microelectrodes
filled with 2M KMeSO4 and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 [tip resistance
90–120 MΩ (47)]. Recordings of membrane input resistance (IR)
were obtained in response to 800 ms, 200 pA hyperpolarizing current
injections using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices)
while holding the cell at −70 mV. To generate an AHP cells were
held at −65 mV (baseline) and depolarized with a 100 ms current
injection to generate four Na+ action potentials. The medium AHP
(mAHP) was measured as the peak hyperpolarization immediately
after the offset of the depolarizing current injection, the slow AHP
(sAHP) was measured 800 ms after the end of the current injection.
The AHP duration was measured from the end of the depolarizing
step until return to baseline.
Several concentrations and formulations of insulin were tested
ex vivo by addition to the solution bathing the hippocampal slices.
Humalog concentrations of 1, 100, and 500 nM were used. A zinc
(ZnCl2) concentration of 130 nM was used to mirror levels of free
zinc attained in 250 nM Humalog. Apidra (insulin glulisine, Sanofi,
a zinc-free insulin formulation) was used at 1 nM and results were
compared to ACSF. Under these experiments, Apidra was used to
treat slices both in the static chamber and during recording of the
AHP. Apidra was continuously perfused into the flow of the oxygenated
recording ACSF using a precision perfusion pump (Orion
Research, Model 341B, Boston, MA) and resulting in a final concentration
of 1 nM (diluted in sterile saline once a week from the
600 μM stock). Only neurons with IR > 25 MΩ, holding current <
500 pA and action potentials reaching above zero mV were included
in the analysis.

Statistics
Statistical analyses testing for significance (p < .05) of main factors
and interactions used a one-way or a two-way ANOVA as well as a
t-test design (some electrophysiology). Fisher’s PLSD was used for
post hoc comparisons. All tests were conducted using StatView statistical
package (version 5, Cary, NC) or GraphPad Prism V5 (San
Diego, CA). Together the behavioral and electrophysiological data
presented here are derived from a total of 106 animals.
Results
Blood Analyses
Several studies show that intranasal insulin either has no effect, or
a moderate lowering effect (within the euglycemic range) on peripheral
blood glucose (36–38,53,61–63). A two-way RM ANOVA
shows intranasal insulin did not alter peripheral blood glucose levels
in a subset of the aged animals (n = 5/group) 30–90 minutes
after intranasal insulin Levemir delivery (Supplementary Table 1). In
another group of aged animals, 40 IU Humalog also was unable to
alter blood glucose levels. This result is consistent with transport of
insulin to the perivascular space around blood vessels, indicating the
hormone may not have crossed into the blood stream (56,64).
Behavioral Analyses
All groups learned to find the platform in the MWM as demonstrated
by a significant decrease in path length to goal across the first
3 days of training [F(2,116) = 27.2; p < .0001]. During this learning
phase, path length (Figure 1A) however, showed no significant differences
across groups with age or intranasal insulin dose (two-way
RM ANOVA). As shown previously (57,65), analysis of swim speed
revealed a significant group effect [F(5,58) = 12.5; p < .0001] with
post hoc tests indicating aged animals swam at slower speeds compared
to young animals, but no difference between the insulin treatment
groups was noted (Figure 1D). Latency to target, as predicted
from slower speeds in aged animals, was significant across 3 days
of training [F(2,116) = 28.9; p < .0001], with increased latency seen
in all aged animals compared with young saline animals (data not
shown). Because of this decrease in swim speed we chose to assess
search errors and quantify memory performance on the probe day
(no platform) using a proximity measure analysis. This approach is
less dependent on swim speed than latency and is tabulated using a
cumulative search error derived from the subject’s distance to the
platform summed over the time to reach the platform and is then
subtracted from an ideal path (straight line); smaller values are indicative
of better performance (66).
Compared to the learning component of the task, the 24-hour
memory recall component measured during the probe trial (oneway
ANOVA) revealed a significant group effect on path length
to goal [F(5,58) = 2.9; p < .05) and on cumulative search error
[F(5,58) = 3.3; p < .05). Post hoc analyses identified a significant
increase on path length and cumulative search error in the aged
saline (p < .05) and aged medium-dose Levemir (p < .005) groups
compared with the young saline group (Figure 1B and C). A trend
(p = .059) for improved performance was found for the high-dose
Levemir animals on path length measures only. Notably, no significant
differences were found between young saline treated and
aged animals treated with either low-dose Humalog or low-dose
Levemir on path length or cumulative proximal distance (Figure 1B
and C), indicating that the lower dose intranasal insulin significantly
reduced age-dependent memory loss. Additional post hoc analyses
Figure 1. Morris water maze spatial learning and memory task. (A) Path length
to submerged goal platform on the initial 3 days of training showed improved
performance across all groups tested (RM ANOVA p < .0001), however,
no group effect was seen. On probe day, with platform removed, animals
receiving low doses of insulin (Humalog or Levemir) showed reduced path
lengths to goal (B) and improved memory performance based on reductions
in cumulative search error (C). Analysis of swim speed measured on the third
training day shows aged F344 animals are slower [note no effect of insulin
dose on speed (D)]. Mean ± SEM are shown. Asterisks indicate significant
differences from the young saline group at p < .05; pound sign indicates a
trend (p = .059) in comparison to the young saline group.

on memory performance in aged animals, comparing combined low
dose insulins (Humalog and Levemir) with combined medium- and
high-dose Levemir, revealed significant improvement in the low-dose
insulin group on path length [F(1,33) = 5.25; p < .05] and cumulative
search error [F(1,33) = 5.91; p < .05]. Thus, each of the different
insulin formulations (Humalog and Levemir at low-doses) improved
performance despite being administered to two separate cohorts of
aged animals, indicating reproducibility of the insulin effect, and it
appears lower, rather than higher doses of insulin are able to redress
cognitive decline with aging.
Electrophysiology Analyses
Based on improved memory recall observed in aged animals treated
with low-dose insulins, we next characterized the effects of in vivo
intranasal insulin on hippocampal electrophysiology in a subset of
the Humalog treated animals that were behaviorally characterized.
Supplementary Table 2 shows that passive membrane properties
were not different between groups and suggests cells with comparable
baseline characteristics were analyzed. Intracellular recording of
CA1 pyramidal neurons were obtained from animals treated with
intranasal saline or Humalog (see Methods section). Approximately
3–7 hours following intranasal insulin delivery the Ca2+-dependent
AHP was not significantly different between groups (Figure 2B and
C; t-test). This was true for measures of AHP amplitude (medium
and slow AHP) and duration (not shown). Extracellular synaptic
potentials also showed no significant difference across groups
(Figure 2D and E; t-test). EPSP amplitudes measured at 33% of the
I/O were slightly larger in the Humalog treated animals and I/O
slopes based on EPSP amplitude measures were somewhat reduced
(Figure 2D and E, respectively, p < .1). These results are surprising
given our prior report that insulin application to hippocampal slices
reduces the AHP (50). In the prior study, however, hippocampal
slices were perfused for 15 minutes with insulin and then studied
electrophysiologically. The results obtained in the present study
raise the possibility that the delay between intranasal insulin exposure
and electrophysiological recording (3–7 hours) was too long
and that the effect of insulin on the AHP may have dissipated. Thus,
to confirm that insulin must be present in order to alter hippocampal
physiology, we tested a range of ex vivo insulin concentrations
and formulations on hippocampal slices from a separate group of
animals.
We used young animals in the next series of experiments,
and examined three different doses of Humalog, comparing
Humalog’s actions to zinc and ACSF. In most insulin formulations,
zinc is used to promote hexamer formation and prolong
stability and duration of action in vivo. However, zinc is also
known to modify ion flux across neuronal membranes, reducing
activity at NMDA and GABAA receptors, ion channels associated
with memory-related processes [reviewed in (67)]. Extracellular
recordings in the presence of zinc or Humalog showed that neither
EPSP amplitudes, nor I/O slopes were significantly altered
when compared to ACSF controls (Figure 3E and F; one-way
ANOVA). Similarly to data shown in Figure 3, these results indicate
little if any, effects of insulin on extracellular postsynaptic
potentials.
Intracellular recordings obtained from the same group of animals
showed that the Ca2+-dependent AHP was sensitive to treatment
with zinc or insulin. As previously reported, measures of postsynaptic
excitability demonstrated the sensitivity of the AHP to both
zinc (68) and insulin (50). A main effect of treatment on the slow
AHP [F(4,18) = 3.34; p < .05] and its duration [F(4,18) = 4.49; p
< .02] was seen across five groups of recorded cells (Figure 3C and
D). Albeit being somewhat reduced, the mAHP was not significantly
altered by insulin (Figure 3B). These results suggest a component of
the insulin effect on the AHP could well be mediated by zinc found
in this insulin formulation. To test the direct impact of ex vivo insulin
on the AHP, we next investigated a zinc-free formulation of insulin
(Apidra).
In this next series of experiments we obtained hippocampal slices
from young (n = 8) and aged (n = 9) F344 rats and focused exclusively
on intracellular potentials and the response to ex vivo Apidra
exposure (1 nM). Further, a recent study identified that 0.1–100 nM
exogenous insulin concentrations could reliably elicit dose-dependent
activation of the insulin signaling pathway in human brain tissues
(69), and approximated physiological levels near 1 nM. For
these reasons, we used 1 nM Apidra. As previously reported (47–
49,70) and shown here (Figure 4), mAHP and sAHP amplitudes
recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons were increased [F(1,24) = 17.6,
p < .0005; F(1,24) = 4.7, p < .05, respectively] in aged, compared

to young animals (two-way ANOVA). Treatment with the zinc-free
Apidra insulin significantly reduced the AHP in slices from both
young and aged rats as indicated by a main effect of treatment on
the mAHP [F(1,24) = 32, p < .0001] and the sAHP [F(1,24) = 29.1, p
< .0001). However, the Apidra-mediated AHP reduction was larger
in aged animals compared to young animals (Figure 4A and B) as
evidenced by a significant interaction term in the two-way ANOVA
[F(1,24) = 10.9, p < .005 for the mAHP]. These results are consistent
with our prior work using Humalog showing that the hippocampal
AHP is sensitive to insulin (50). In the experiments presented here
however, it is clear that insulin alone has a direct effect on the AHP,
and that this effect persists even when lower, more physiological
glucose levels are used in the ACSF (experiments in Figure 4 were
conducted with 4.5 rather than the typical 10 mM glucose concentration—
see Methods section). Finally, it is interesting to note that
Apidra did not alter holding current when compared to control cells
(sup. Table 2), indicating insulin is neither activating nor inhibiting a
tonic current near resting potential.
Discussion
Studies in humans have shown that intranasal insulin has promising
cognition enhancing effects, alleviating, and perhaps even slowing
the progression of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. However,
the mechanisms underlying insulin’s effects in the brain are unclear.
In order to identify potential mechanisms, we treated aged rodents
with intranasal insulin, attempting to model aspects of the clinical
Figure 4. Zinc-free Apidra reduces the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) ex vivo.
The medium AHP (mAHP) amplitude is shown in (A) and the slow AHP
(sAHP) amplitude is shown in (B). Mean ± SEM are presented in response to
1 nM Apidra. These data are taken from young and aged F344 rats. Asterisks
indicate significant age-dependent increases in the mAHP and sAHP, and
pound signs illustrate significant insulin-mediated reductions in the AHP.
Again, the impact of insulin seems more robust on the sAHP compared to
the mAHP. These recordings were obtained with 4.5 mM glucose in the ACSF.
Figure 3. Impact of ex vivo Humalog and zinc on the afterhyperpolarization
(AHP). (A) Representative voltage trace of the AHP recorded in a cell from
an ACSF treated slice (black) and a Humalog treated slice (1 nM, gray). Data
are derived from young Sprague-Dawley animals. Traces are truncated to
emphasize the AHP. Significant reductions in the slow AHP (sAHP) amplitude
(C) and duration (D) were seen in response to Humalog as well as zinc. Note
that zinc and low concentration Humalog seem to work more robustly on the
sAHP [only a trend was noted for the medium AHP (B)]. No significant effect
was detected during extracellular recording of field EPSP amplitudes (E) or
slopes of the I/O curve (F). Mean ± SEM are shown.

trials reporting on the beneficial impact of intranasal insulin. Here,
we describe physiological actions of insulin in the brain, highlighting
a potential new mechanism of action of insulin on hippocampal
function in both young and aged rats. This first analysis of intranasal
insulin in aged animals demonstrates that intranasal insulin
improved memory recall in aged F344 rats. We show that the effect
on memory was observed in two separate cohorts of animals, using
two different insulin formulations (Humalog and Levemir) delivered
at relatively low dose (0.0715 IU/day/rat). Thus, these studies also
demonstrate reproducibility of the effect of insulin on behavior. We
also show that the Ca2+-dependent AHP, and in particular the slow
AHP, a Ca2+-related biomarker of brain aging which increases with
age and cognitive decline, is reduced by acute insulin exposure in
aged animals and could well represent a novel target of brain insulin
underlying the improvement seen in memory recall.
Long-acting insulin (Levemir) was as effective as short-acting
insulin (Humalog) on memory recall in aged animals, inducing levels
of performance indistinguishable from those seen in young animals.
Levemir’s long duration of action is dependent on the presence of
albumin in the periphery and a fatty acid modification of the insulin
structure, increasing its’ affinity for albumin. Humalog’s shorter
duration and faster onset are due to amino acid modifications in the
β-chain of the insulin molecule. Because both versions of insulin were
able to reverse cognitive decline to a similar degree in aged animals,
our results suggest both insulins were able to gain access to the brain
following intranasal administration despite structural differences.
While results from clinical studies in memory-impaired older adults
have reported improved word recall within 15-minute post-intranasal
delivery (71), a prior clinical study on younger adults demonstrated
the superiority of a faster acting insulin (Novolog) compared
to regular insulin (Actrapid) on delayed word recall after 7 weeks
of intranasal 160 IU/day Novolog (63). Using shorter delays (ie, 10
minutes) a recent study reveals 40 IU intranasal insulin delivery to
young adult males improves odor-cued spatial memory (72). Clearly,
the memory enhancing effects of insulin are depend on treatment
regimen (acute vs subchronic), but also on the age and gender of the
subject (73), as well as on the insulin formulation used (52,74). As
mentioned above, a single, acute intranasal dose of insulin is capable
of enhancing memory in humans and our electrophysiological studies
showing an acute action of insulin on the AHP indicate that insulin
can have rapid effects on neuronal processes critical to memory
(see later). However, in the current study, it is unclear whether the
effects on cognition observed were due to an acute action of insulin
(ie, the dose received 1–3 hours prior to memory testing), or the
result of the cumulative daily treatments received over the course
of 8–11 days.
The decrease in the AHP by insulin was observed in field CA1 of
the hippocampus, a synaptic zone which plays a key role in memory
processing. Decreasing the AHP in this structure would be expected
to increase neuronal excitability and facilitate throughput during
physiological activation. Consistent with this, exogenous insulin
increases excitatory neurotransmitter receptor trafficking including
NMDA and AMPA receptors (25–27,75), thus promoting network
activation. Furthermore, pure insulin has been shown to activate an
inward current and depolarize hypothalamic neurons via activation
of transient receptor potential channels, providing supporting evidence
that insulin raises excitability (76). However, recent results
provide evidence that insulin or other therapies that raise insulin
(exendin-4 and glucagon-like peptide-1), increase functional GABAA
conductances in CA1 (19) as well as in CA3 pyramidal neurons (77).
This observation is in line with prior reports of enhanced GABAA
function in response to insulin, a resulting decrease in synaptic activity
(17,18) and a long-lasting enhancement of inhibitory postsynaptic
currents [IPSCs (78)]. The net result, therefore, of enhancing
both steady-state hyperpolarizing (GABA-mediated) and short-term
depolarizing forces (eg, reduced AHP or direct depolarization) could
well increase synaptic signal-to-noise, thereby improving throughput
and neuronal communication. Clearly, as seen in hypothalamic arcuate
nucleus neurons, it is important to note that insulin’s modulatory
influence on membrane potential/excitability, is insulin formulation
dependent, as well as cell-type specific (76).
To extend slice health and allow for extended neuronal recordings,
high glucose concentrations (10 mM) are commonly used in
the ex vivo hippocampal slice. However, this superphysiological
glucose concentration may alter insulin sensitivity in the brain. For
this reason, we used lower glucose levels in some experiments while
maintaining tissue health (Table 2), and more closely approximating
physiological glucose levels. Importantly, significant AHP reduction
was seen irrespective of recording conditions (10 or 4.5 mM
glucose). Thus, the results presented here appear compatible with
potential effects of insulin on hippocampal neurons in vivo.
The placebo group in almost all clinical trials studying the impact
of intranasal insulin on memory function is generally exposed to
either saline or HOE-31, a dilution buffer that does not contain zinc.
Given that all insulin formulations except Apidra contain zinc, our
results showing that Apidra is capable of reducing the AHP in hippocampal
neurons ex vivo could have clinical significance. These
data are consistent with insulin per se being able to alter hippocampal
physiology, and suggest that insulin and not zinc may be responsible
for the CNS effects of intranasal insulin on memory. Clearly
further clinical trials with Apidra appear warranted.
Because the AHP is dependent on a Ca2+-activated K+ conductance,
the insulin-mediated reductions in the AHP may be due to
inhibition of Ca2+ influx (79) or inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channel
currents as seen in pinealocytes (80). Taken together, these
results suggest insulin acts through the insulin receptor to reduce
calcium-mediated functions possibly through PI3 kinase- or tyrosine
kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ca2+ channel proteins.
Indeed, insulin can enhance mitochondrial function and therefore,
Ca2+ homeostasis through PI3 kinase mechanisms in the periphery
(40). Insulin also increases sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-
ATPase (SERCA) function in heart cells via an Akt (protein kinase
B) pathway, and in neurons, insulin has been shown to reduce
KV1.3 potassium channel function (81). Notably, all of these
potential mechanisms are consistent with reductions in available
Ca2+, and hence, reductions in the amplitude of Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarizing potentials.
Our data cannot address whether the beneficial actions of intranasal
insulin on memory recall are mediated, in parts or in whole,
by the effects of insulin on the AHP. While suggestive that this may
be the case, we do not provide evidence to support this conclusion.
Further, because young animals were not tested for the impact of
intranasal insulin, future studies will be needed to test the hypothesis
that the observed effect is age-selective, or generally nootropic.
Finally, although a similar insulin dose yielded quantitatively similar
enhancement on memory recall in two cohorts of aged animals, it is
not clear that higher Humalog doses might also be ineffective, similarly
to higher Levemir doses.
The present results shed new light on a previously unrecognized
insulin mechanism in the brain. Reductions in the AHP could enhance
neuronal communication and might represent a pathway through
which low dose Humalog or Levemir improve memory recall in aged

animals. We show that insulin targeted the AHP, a Ca2+-mediated
conductance, and reduced AHP amplitude and duration, elevations
of which are characteristic of brain aging. We propose that facilitating
insulin signaling restores Ca2+ homeostasis in aged animals,
resulting in optimal levels of membrane excitability and synaptic
plasticity, in part by limiting the amplitude and duration of the AHP
in CA1 neurons (Figures 4 and 5). During aging, reductions in brain
insulin levels and/or insulin receptor function (see Introduction section)
may help promote neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation, resulting in
impaired membrane excitability and reduced synaptic plasticity (eg,
larger AHP). Clearly, given the reductions in insulin receptor RNA
and protein in the aged rodent (5,6), greater occupation of the leftover
insulin receptors with insulin could well offset reductions in
signaling through these receptors, or may even slow the age-related
reduction in insulin receptor density. Collectively, these results indicate
robust associations between brain insulin, Ca2+ homeostasis,
and aging-related cognitive decline, and suggest the value of further
developing “insulin-raising” strategies for treating cognitive decline
in age and disease, perhaps curbing the development of AD.
