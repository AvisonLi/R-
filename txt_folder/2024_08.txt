Abstract
Introduction The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area of South China has an 86 million population and
faces a significant challenge of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the characteristics and prevalence of AD in this area
are still unclear due to the rarely available community-based neuroimaging AD cohort.
Methods Following the standard protocols of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Greater-Bay-
Area Healthy Aging Brain Study (GHABS) was initiated in 2021. GHABS participants completed clinical assessments,
plasma biomarkers, genotyping, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), β-amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging, and tau PET imaging. The GHABS cohort focuses on pathophysiology characterization and early AD
detection in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. In this study, we analyzed plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 (A),
p-Tau181 (T), neurofilament light, and GFAP by Simoa in 470 Chinese older adults, and 301, 195, and 70 had MRI, Aβ
PET, and tau PET, respectively. Plasma biomarkers, Aβ PET, tau PET, hippocampal volume, and temporal-metaROI
cortical thickness were compared between normal control (NC), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), and dementia groups, controlling for age, sex, and APOE-ε4. The prevalence of plasma A/T profiles
and Aβ PET positivity were also determined in different diagnostic groups.
Results The aims, study design, data collection, and potential applications of GHABS are summarized. SCD individuals
had significantly higher plasma p-Tau181 and plasma GFAP than the NC individuals. MCI and dementia patients
showed more abnormal changes in all the plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers than NC and SCD individuals. The
frequencies of plasma A+/T+ (NC; 5.9%, SCD: 8.2%, MCI: 25.3%, dementia: 64.9%) and Aβ PET positivity (NC: 25.6%,
SCD: 22.5%, MCI: 47.7%, dementia: 89.3%) were reported.

Background
Alzheimer’s dementia patients suffer from memory
loss, cognitive dysfunction, behavioral abnormalities,
and social disorders [1]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the
leading cause of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of all
cases [2]. Extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary
tau tangles are the two key hallmarks of AD
[3]. AD patients have reduced Aβ42 concentrations in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [4] or plasma [5], elevated cortical
Aβ plaques [6–8], CSF or plasma phosphorylated
Tau (p-Tau) concentrations [9], and cortical tau tangles
[10], which eventually result in synaptic loss [11–13],
hippocampal atrophy [14], Temporal-metaROI cortical
thinning [15], hypometabolism and cognitive decline
[4, 9, 16]. Such abnormal changes in Aβ and tau can be
detected by biomarkers or positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging 15–20 years before the earliest clinical
symptoms of AD [17–19]. According to the research
framework proposed by the National Institute on Aging
and Alzheimer’s Association in 2018 [20], cognitively
unimpaired (CU) older adults with the evidence of Aβ
pathology measured by either CSF Aβ biomarker [4] or
Aβ PET imaging [6] are defined as preclinical AD. Moreover,
around 30% of the CU individuals aged 70 and over
are at the preclinical AD stage [21] and have a high risk of
cognitive decline in the future [22, 23].
The prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) among older adults aged 60 and above in
China is 6.0% and 15.5%, respectively. Among those
cases, the majority (65%) is dementia or MCI due to AD,
followed by vascular dementia (26.7%) and other dementias
(8.3%) [24]. Additionally, the prevalence of preclinical
AD defined by Aβ PET imaging among adults aged 60
or older was around 18% [21]. Approximately 260 million
individuals are 60 years or older in China [25]. Among
them, around 15 million, 39 million, and 47 million
individuals are at the stage of dementia, MCI, and preclinical
AD, respectively. China’s total expenditure on
dementia treatment and nursing services will be $1.89
trillion around 2050 [26]. AD has become the fifth leading
cause of death disease in China in 2019 [27]. The agestandardized
prevalence and the age-standardized death
rate of AD and related dementias were 788.3/100 000 and
23.3/100 000, separately, which were slightly higher than
that of the global levels (682.5/100 000 and 22.9/100 000,
separately) [27]. The high prevalence and vast population
of AD severely challenge China.
Recently, three anti-Aβ drugs, including Aducanumab
[28], Lecanemab [29], and Donanemab [30] showed positive
results in phase 3 clinical trials. Consequently, early
AD diagnosis and intervention are critical for preventing
AD progression. However, the standardization of
biomarker measurements, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and PET image scanning and processing of
AD are not fully established yet in China. Therefore,
the neuroscientists, neurologists, pathologists, radiopharmacists,
biomedical engineers, and biochemists
in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area
are working together to initiate the Greater-Bay-Area
Healthy Aging Brain Study (GHABS), aiming to investigate
the pathological features and progression patterns
of AD, especially in asymptomatic stage of AD. GHABS
participants will undergo clinical neuropsychological
assessments, biospecimen sample collection, MRI imaging,
and PET imaging. The GHABS project aims to: (1)
explore the risk factors of Aβ and tau aggregation in
the early stage of AD among China’s aging population;
(2) determine the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies upon
downstream neurodegeneration and cognitive decline
in both Aβ negative (Aβ-) and Aβ positive (Aβ+) elderly
adults; (3) identify novel approaches and techniques for
early detection of AD and provides significant reference
for the target brain region and appropriate time window
for anti-AD treatments.
In this study, we first summarized the aims, study
design, data collection, and potential applications of
GHABS. Second, we compared the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40,
plasma p-Tau181, plasma GFAP, plasma NfL, Aβ PET,
tau PET, hippocampal volume, and temporal-MetaROI
cortical thickness between normal control (NC), subjective
cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and dementia groups.
Third, we also reported the prevalence of plasma A/T
staging and Aβ PET positivity of different diagnostic
groups in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-
Bay-Area of South China.
Methods
Study design
Shenzhen Bay Laboratory launched the communitybased
longitudinal cohort study GHABS (ClinicalTrials.
gov ID: NCT06183658) in May 2021. The GHABS
Discussion The GHABS cohort may provide helpful guidance toward designing standard AD community cohorts
in South China. This study, for the first time, reported the pathophysiology characterization of plasma biomarkers,
Aβ PET, tau PET, hippocampal atrophy, and AD-signature cortical thinning, as well as the prevalence of Aβ PET
positivity in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China. These findings provide novel insights into
understanding the characteristics of abnormal AD pathological changes in South China’s older population.

project was approved by the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory’s
and the collaborated hospitals’ Ethical Committees. The
flow chart of participant engagement in the GHABS is
delineated in Supplementary Fig. 1. The GHABS participants
were recruited via posters and lectures in the community
and nursing homes. Each participant signed the
written informed consent of the GHABS project before
enrollment. The participants who met the inclusion and
exclusion requirements were informed about the baseline
and follow-up examinations. From 2021 to 2026, the
GHABS cohort will recruit 1400 individuals aged 55 and
older, including 1100 CU older adults, 200 MCI patients,
and 100 dementia patients. The scheme for recruiting
GHABS participants is illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1.
All the GHABS participants will undergo cognitive
assessments, genetic screening, and blood sample collection.
Some will have CSF collection, stool sample collection,
MRI scanning, Aβ PET scanning, and tau PET
scanning. All baseline examinations will be completed
within three months. At follow-up, clinical assessments
and blood sample collection will be conducted annually.
CSF sample collection, MRI scan, Aβ PET scan, and tau
PET scan are evaluated every two years. Six hundred
twenty-seven participants have completed cognitive
assessments and blood sample collection in the GHABS
cohort by Sep 08, 2023 (Fig. 1). Among them, 26%, 44%,
19%, and 11% of the cohort were NC, SCD, MCI, and
dementia, respectively. Additionally, 369 and 93 participants
completed stool and CSF sample collection. So far,
469, 370, and 105 participants had MRI, Aβ PET, and tau
PET imaging scans, respectively. This study identified
470 GHABS participants who simultaneously completed
cognitive assessments, plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, NfL,
and GFAP data measured by the Simoa platform. Among
them, 119, 207, 87, and 57 were NC, SCD, MCI, and
dementia. Moreover, 301, 195, and 70 individuals had
concurrent MRI, 18F-D3-FSP Aβ PET, and FTP tau PET
scans.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Briefly, the inclusion criteria of GHABS are as follows:
(1) adults between the ages of 55 and 90 and speak Mandarin
fluently [31]). Notably, individuals below 60 years
old are required to have a family dementia history and
meet the criteria of subjective cognitive decline (SCD),
while people with family history of autosomal dominant
or other familial AD are not limited by age; (2) the
score on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is less
than 6 points; (3) visual and auditory acuity is sufficient
for neuropsychological testing (Including normal corrected
vision and hearing); (4) female participants are not
pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential (that is,
women must be two years postmenopausal or surgically
sterile); (5) a modified version of the Hachinski Ischemic
scores less than or equal to 4; (6) have completed primary
school (6 years of education) or have good work experience
(sufficient to rule out mental retardation). Individuals
with an infection, infarction, or other focal lesions or
multiple lacunes or lacunes in critical memory structures
and who do not meet the MRI scanning requirements
are excluded from the GHABS study. More details of the
inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the supplemental
materials.
Cognitive assessments
The cognitive profiles are assessed via a series of cognitive
ability tests, including the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog),
Logical Memory Test I & II (the Chinese version), Minimental
State Examination (MMSE, the Chinese version),
Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic (MoCA-Basic),
Shape Trail Test (STT), Clock Drawing Test (CDT),
Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Symbol Digit
Modalities Test (SDMT), Digit Span Test (DST), Animal
Verbal Fluency Test (AFT), Cognitive Change Index
(CCI), SCD. Besides, functional and behavioral tests were
also executed, including the Hachinski Ischemic Score
(HIS), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (NPI), the GDS, Functional Activities Questionnaire
(FAQ), Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL)
[32–34], measurement of everyday cognition (Ecog),
Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), REM sleep behavior
disorder screening questionnaire (RBDSQ), Epworth
Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
The participants were classified as NC, MCI, or dementia
due to AD following the standard protocol of ADNI
cohort [35]. We further define some CU individuals as
SCD following the research criteria proposed by Jessen
and colleagues in 2014 [36]. Several cognitive assessments
were used for clinical diagnosis. The normal performance
of these assessments was defined based on
education or age. The MMSE used cutoff scores: >17 for
participants without education, > 20 for 1–6 years of education,
and > 24 for more than six years of education. The
delayed recall of logical Memory test used cutoff scores
as follows: ≥3 for 0–7 years, ≥5 for 8–15 years, and ≥9 for
16 years of education [37]. As for the ADL, < 23 is normal
for participants under 75 years old, while < 25 is for
75 years and older.
CU participants were normal in MMSE, logical Memory
recall, and ADL, and their CDR score was 0. Among
CU individuals, the presence of the following symptoms
as having SCD: (1) Self-experienced persistent decline in
cognitive capacity in comparison with a previously normal
status and unrelated to an acute event; (2) Normal
age-adjusted, gender-adjusted and education-adjusted
performance on standardized cognitive tests. CU individuals
without SCD were defined as the NC group.

Participants with MCI had unimpaired MMSE, while
they showed impairment in the logical Memory test [38].
Their CDR score was 0.5, with a mandatory requirement
of the memory box score being 0.5 or greater, but
ADL was normal. Dementia due to AD was abnormal in
MMSE, logical memory, and ADL. The CDR score was
0.5 or greater.
Biospecimen collection
Volunteers fasted for one night the day before (not less
than 6 h), and blood was drawn in the morning of the
next day. The venous blood of the volunteers is drawn
into two 10 ml EDTA blood collection tubes and gently
inverted and mixed 10–12 times to ensure that the blood
and anticoagulant are thoroughly mixed. The mixed

blood was placed in an incubator at 4 °C and shipped
back to the laboratory within 4 h for subsequent analysis.
The blood is centrifuged at 1600 g for 10 min in a
refrigerated centrifuge at 4 °C. The upper plasma layer is
transferred to several 2 ml centrifuge tubes using a sterile
RNase-free pipette tip. To obtain more pure plasma,
the separated plasma is centrifuged again at 16,000 g for
10 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant is aliquoted into
several 0.5 ml centrifuge tubes with labels, each with
either 100–200 μl blood plasma. The aliquots are stored
in a -80 °C refrigerator for subsequent analysis. After
the whole blood is centrifuged in the first step, the buffy
coat in the middle layer is gently transferred to the 2640
medium. Then, after density gradient centrifugation,
erythrocyte lysis, and centrifugation steps, the isolated
peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample is transferred
to a 2 ml RNase-free centrifuge tubes and stored in a gradient-
cooled freezer box at -80 °C for subsequent analysis.
Samples will be used for genomic analysis (including
whole genome sequencing and other analyses).
Before collecting the CSF sample, the volunteer must
fast for one night (at least 6 h), and the lumbar spinal
fluid is performed on an empty stomach the following
day. Lumbar puncture is performed strictly with clinical
standards, and about 5 ml of CSF is collected. The collected
CSF is sent to Shenzhen Bay Laboratory within
2 h for biomarker analysis. CSF sample is quickly divided
into 1.5 ml low protein adsorption centrifuge tubes.
Afterward, they will be stored in a -80 °C refrigerator for
subsequent analysis.
Fecal samples are collected on-site or at home after
the volunteers’ consent is obtained. The volunteer stool
samples are labeled, sub-packaged, and frozen in a -80 °C
refrigerator. Fecal samples are used for 16 S rDNA,
metagenomic, metagenome, and metabolome detection
of intestinal microorganisms.
CSF and plasma biomarkers measurement
The concentrations of Aβ40, Aβ42, NfL, GFAP, SNAP25,
p-Tau181, and p-Tau217 in CSF and plasma are detected
using commercial Simoa® NEUROLOGY 4-PLEX E
(N4PE, cat: 103,670), SNAP-25 (cat: 103,575), pTau-181
(cat: 104,111), and pTau-217 kit in Simoa HD-X Analyzer
™ (Quanterix Corp.). The concentrations of YKL40
in CSF and plasma are measured using a commercial
Human YKL-40 Assay (cat: K151VLK) in MESO SECTOR
S 600MM (Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC.). The
concentrations of sTREM2 in CSF and plasma are also
measured by the MSD platform using an in-house
immunoassay as previously described [39]. Briefly,
streptavidin-coated plates are blocked overnight in PBS
containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05%
Tween-20 before incubating with the biotinylated capture
antibody (0.25 μg/mL, cat: BAF1828) for 1 h. After
washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, the plates
are incubated with CSF, and plasma samples diluted in
PBS containing 0.25% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, and Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (cat: P8340) for 2 h. Recombinant
human TREM2 protein (SinoBiological, cat. 11,084-
H08H) is used as a standard (62.5 to 8000 pg/mL). The
plates are rewashed and incubated with the detector antibody
(1 μg/mL, cat: sc373828) for 1 h, followed by incubation
with the MSD SULFO-tag conjugated secondary
antibody (0.5 μg/mL, cat: R32AC). Finally, the electrochemical
signal is developed by adding 2x MSD Read
buffer T (cat: R-92TC), and the MSD SECTOR S 600MM
measures the electro chemiluminescent signal.
The concentrations of PDGFR-β and GAP43 in CSF
and plasma are measured by commercial Human
PDGFR-β (R&D, Catalog Number: DYC385) and GAP43
(Abbexa) ELISA kits. For neurogranin, an in-house sandwich
ELISA is developed combining the mouse monoclonal
antibodies Ng22 and Ng2 (Abcam). Nunc maxisorp
96-well microliter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) are
coated with the mouse anti-human neurogranin (Ng22,
3 μg/mL) in bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 overnight. After
washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, the plates
are blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-
20 for 1 h, followed by incubation with CSF and plasma
samples overnight. Recombinant full-length human neurogranin
protein is used as a standard (25 to 3200 pg/
ml for CSF, 55 to 40,000 pg/mL for plasma). After additional
washes, the plates are incubated with the biotinylated
mouse anti-human neurogranin (Ng2, 2.7 μg/mL)
for 1 h, followed by incubation with a Streptavidin-HRP
(R&D Systems) for 30 min. After additional washes, the
plates are incubated with Substrate Reagent (TMB, R&D
Systems) for 10 min in the dark. The color reaction is
stopped by adding 0.2 M H2SO4, and the absorbance is
read at 450 nm (650 nm as a reference value).
All samples were analyzed randomly and doubleblindly
to avoid bias because of the effect of inter-assay
variability on specific patient groups. For all biomarker
measurements, the samples in the first plate were tested
in duplicate, and subsequent samples were tested in single.
A pooled sample was generated as a reference, aliquoted
and stored at -80 °C. In each measurement, the
reference sample was tested in duplicate to compare the
detection variability. The mean intra-assay and interassay
coefficient of variation (CV) was controlled within
20%.

The Aβ PET radiotracer [18F]-florbetapir (FBP) [40]
or [18F]D3FSP (FSP) [41] and tau PET radiotracer
[18F]-flortaucipir (FTP) [42] are used for PET imaging.
The data acquisition is performed on either a GE Discovery
™ MI Gen 2 PET/CT scanner or a Siemens Biograph
™ TruePoint™ TrueV PET/CT scanner. The spatial
resolution of each PET scanner is quantified with PET
imaging of a Hoffman phantom. For the Aβ PET imaging,
the subjects are injected with either [18F]-florbetapir
or [18F]-D3FSP intravenously at 370 MBq (10 mCi ± 10%),
rested for 45 min and prepared for the scanning. PET/
CT imaging is performed 50 min after injection, and the
Liu et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2024) 16:84 Page 7 of 16
PET acquisition time is 20 min. For the tau PET imaging,
the participants are injected with [18F]-flortaucipir intravenously
at 370 MBq (10 mCi ± 10%), rested for 75 min,
and prepared for imaging. The dynamic acquisition of
[18F]-flortaucipir tau PET data is completed 80–100 min
after the radiotracer administration.
A dedicated head scanning procedure covering the
whole brain from vertex to cerebellum is used for imaging.
A diagnostic dose CT scan of the brain is acquired
beforehand for attenuation correction and fusion localization
of PET images. The PET scans are acquired
using 3D list mode on the GE Discovery MI and Siemens
BioGraph TruePoint scanners in two sites. For
the GE scanner, the FOV is 256 mm×256 mm×220 mm,
the scanning matrix is 336 × 336 × 109, and the voxel
size is 1.02 mm×1.02 mm×2.03 mm. For the Siemens
scanner, FOV is 256 mm×256 mm×198 mm, the scanning
matrix is 192 × 192 × 71, and the voxel size is
1.33 mm×1.33 mm×2.79 mm. All the correction options
were selected for both scanners, and no filter or smooth
was used during the reconstruction. A reconstruction
offset is applied to ensure that the head is entirely
in the field of view within the plane. Finally, 4 frames of
dynamic images are generated according to 5 min/frame
segmentation, with each PET scan corresponding to a
20-minute PET image.
MRI and PET imaging analysis
The structural MRI images are segmented into different
cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROI) in
Freesurfer (V7.2.0). The residual hippocampal volume
(rHCV) is calculated using the hippocampal volume of
both hemispheres and adjusted using the estimated total
intracranial volume as we described previously [14]. In
addition, the cortical thickness of AD-signature atrophy
brain regions is obtained by calculating the surface areaweighted
average thickness of the bilateral entorhinal,
fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle temporal cortices
[43].
As shown in Fig. 2, the PET images are preprocessed
with the following steps before further analysis: (1) coregistering
the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th frames to the 1st frame,
respectively; (2) averaging the four frames into one averaged
frame; (3) the averaged frame resliced into a standard
AC-PC space (anterior commissure-posterior
commissure) with image size = 160 × 160 × 128, voxel
dimension = 1.5 mm×1.5 mm×1.5 mm; (4) this standardized
image then served as a reference imaging, and each

original individual frame was resliced to this reference
imaging; (5) smoothing to a uniform 6 mm resolution
using the Gaussian kernel function, and the full-width
at half maximum (FWHM) of each site was determined
from the Hoffman phantom [18F]FDG-PET imaging (As
a reference for mitigating between-scanner differences in
multi-center PET scans). The PET and MRI images are
processed using in-house Matlab algorithms, as shown in
Fig. 2. The PET images are co-registered with their corresponding
structural MRI images in SPM12 (Statistical
Parametric Mapping). Sixty-eight Freesurfer-defined
cortical ROIs obtained from MRI segmentation extract
regional FSP, FBP, and FTP measurements from the coregistered
PET images.
The FSP and FBP standardized uptake value ratio
(SUVR) of AD summary cortical regions (posterior cingulate
cortex, precuneus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and
lateral temporal) are obtained by dividing the radiotracer
uptake value of AD typical brain regions by that in the
whole cerebellum [44]. In the present study, we only
presented FSP Aβ PET data. For the [18F]-flortaucipir
images, FTP SUVR of 68 FreeSurfer-defined ROIs are
calculated by normalizing the [18F]-flortaucipir value to
the value of the inferior cerebellar cortex [45]. The FTP
SUVR of the AD Temporal-MetaROI [43] (entorhinal
cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform, amygdala, inferior
temporal and middle temporal brain regions) is used
to evaluate cortical tau deposition.
The general process of resting-state fMRI data preprocessing
and brain functional connectivity construction
are outlined in the third column of Fig. 2 and described in
detail in the Supplemental Materials. The general process
of diffusion MRI processing are outlined in the fourth column
of Fig. 2 and described in detail in the Supplemental
Materials. Diffusion-weighted data are denoised and
corrected for Gibbs ring using Mrtrix3 (V3.0.3) [46], and
then corrections were applied for head motion, eddy current,
and EPI susceptibility distortion using FSL (V6.0.3)
[47]. 3D pCASL imaging was employed to calculate the
CBF map (Supplemental Fig. 3). The WMH segmentation
was processed using a custom pipeline developed by our
lab based on the T2 FLAIR images (Supplemental Fig. 4).
More details of fMRI, dMRI, WMH, and pCASL can be
found in Supplementary Material.
Cutoffs of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, and plasma p-Tau181, and FSP
Aβ PET
We used Gaussian mixed model analysis to estimate two
Gaussian distributions of low Aβ and high Aβ (Supplemental
Fig. 5) for COMPOSITE FSP SUVR to define an
unsupervised threshold, which corresponds to a 90%
probability of belonging to the high Aβ distribution.
The thresholds of FSP SUVR were defined as COMPOSITE
SUVR≥0.76 (Supplemental Fig. 5). The receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the
Youden index classifying 154 Aβ- cognitively unimpaired
(CU) participants and 69 Aβ + cognitively impaired (CI)
individuals (MCI or dementia) as the endpoint to define
the cutoff ≤ 0.0609 for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (Supplemental
Figs. 6–7). Similarly, the ROC analysis using the
Youden index classifying 143 Aβ- CU participants and 67
Aβ + CI participants as the endpoint to define the cutoff
≥ 2.418 for plasma p-Tau181 (Supplemental Figs. 8–9).
The cohort was divided into A-/T-, A-/T+, A+/T-, and
A+/T + according to the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and
plasma p-Tau181 thresholds.
Statistical analysis
All the statistical analyses were conducted using R
(v4.3.0, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). The
normal distribution of the data in this study was determined
using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Plasma p-Tau181,
plasma GFAP, and plasma NfL were log10 transferred
before the following analysis to meet the normal distribution.
We used a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test
and Fisher’s exact test to compare the continuous and
categorical characteristics at baseline between different
diagnosis groups, respectively. Data were presented
as median (interquartile range, IQR) or No. (%) unless
otherwise noted. Generalized linear models were used
to compare plasma biomarkers, COMPOSITE FSP
Aβ SUVR, temporal-metaROI FTP SUVR, rHCV, and
temporal-metaROI cortical thickness between different
clinical groups, controlling for age, sex, and APOE-ε4.
Subsequently, we investigated the frequency of different
A/T profiles defined by plasma biomarkers (A: plasma
Aβ42/Aβ40, T: plasma p-Tau181) and Aβ PET positivity
among NC, SCD, MCI, and dementia groups.

The demographic characteristics of participants included
in this study are summarized in Table 1. At baseline, MCI
and dementia individuals had older ages, higher percentages
of APOE-ε4 carriers, shorter duration of education,
and lower MoCA and MMSE scores than NC and SCD
individuals. The dementia group also had lower MoCA
and MMSE scores than the MCI group. The SCD group
had more females than the MCI and dementia groups.
Additionally, 443 participants had risk factors records,
including the medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and diabetes, as well as the assessments of
PSQI and GDS. SCD individuals had higher percentage
of hyperlipidemia compared to the NC and MCI groups.
SCD and MCI individuals had worse sleep state than
NC and dementia individuals, while dementia individuals
showed better sleep state than NC individuals. MCI
and dementia individuals had higher depression scores

Discussion
There are approximately 47 million preclinical AD individuals,
39 million MCI patients, and 15 million dementia
patients in China. In 2035, the older population aged
60 and above is expected to exceed 400 million, accounting
for more than 30% of the total population. As long
as there are no practical methods for the early detection
and treatment of AD, the number of AD patients
in China will continue to rise. To end this, the GHABS
study was initiated in 2021. The GHABS study aims to
investigate the prevalence and progression of AD in the
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area of
China. The ultimate goal is to develop novel biomarkers
and neuroimaging approaches for early diagnosis of
AD and support the early intervention of clinical trials
in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area
(Fig. 5).
Following the standard protocol of ADNI [50], the
GHABS is supposed to be a high-standard AD community
cohort in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao
Greater-Bay-Area of China. GHABS referred to several
well-established large-scale AD cohorts from Europe
and the United States, such as the Mayo Clinical Study
of Aging [51], the Harvard Aging Brain Study [52], the
Swedish Biomarkers For Identifying Neurodegenerative
Disorders Early and Reliably, the Amyloid Imaging
to Prevent Alzheimer’s Disease [53], and the Australian
Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study [54]. Based on
these databases, many breakthroughs have been made in
AD-related gene loci, biomarker detection, PET molecular
imaging, etc., which provide important support for
screening target participants and therapeutic targets in
AD clinical trials. Besides, GHABS also referred to several
well-organized cohorts in China, such as the Beijing
Aging Brain Rejuvenation Initiative [55], China Aging
and Neurodegenerative Initiative [56], Chinese Alzheimer’s
Biomarker and LifestylE [57], the Chongqing Ageing
& Dementia Study (CADS) [58], Chinese Preclinical
Alzheimer’s Disease Study (C-PAS) [59], the China Cognition
and Ageing Study [60], the Taizhou Imaging Study
[61], and Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline
[62]. Dr. Ying Han, the president of the “Pre-Alzheimer’s
Disease Alliance of China,” is one of the principal investigators
in GHABS. Dr. Han initiated the Pre-AD Alliance
of China in 2017 [63] and led two AD cohorts focused on
the population of SCD for early AD diagnosis and investigation,
the SILCODE and Cross-Cultural Longitudinal
Study on Cognitive Decline [64]. The design of GHABS
will be updated by the researchers if necessary. GHABS
closely follows the latest academic and industry developments
in the field and tries to adapt and update protocols.
The primary goal of GHABS is to investigate the pathological
characteristics, risk factors, protective indicators,
and evolution of Aβ and tau pathologies in Guangdong-
Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area older adults. The
specific studies are as follows: (1) summarize the incidence
of preclinical AD (Aβ + CU) in the Guangdong-
Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area, and reveal the
Fig. 4 The frequency of plasma A/T profiles and Aβ PET positivity between different clinical groups. Comparisons of (A) A/T profiles defined by plasma

characteristics and progression of AD pathologies; (2)
study the feasibility of plasma biomarkers for detecting
early AD in older adults; (3) determine the risk factors
related to abnormal changes in Aβ and tau proteins; (4)
reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical Aβ plaques,
tau tangles aggregation, synapse loss, and neuroinflammation
and their relations to brain atrophy and cognitive
decline; (5) investigate the roles of neuroinflammation,
synaptic loss, vascular diseases, myelination, metabolic
dysfunction across the spectrum of AD. Hopefully, these
studies based on the GHABS cohort may provide novel
insights into the early diagnosis and intervention of AD
in China and the AD community.
Compared to CSF biomarkers and PET imaging,
plasma biomarkers are the most promising early screening
technology for AD by considering the advantages of
simple sampling, low traumatic, and cost [65]. Recently,
plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 [66, 67], p-Tau181 [68], p-Tau217 [69],
p-Tau231 [70], and GFAP [71] showed great potential
in early diagnosis of AD. One of the primary goals of
GHABS is to evaluate the performance of previously
reported plasma biomarkers and further explore novel
plasma biomarkers in China’s aging population. For
example, the GHABS research group has investigated
the characteristics of CSF GAP43 in different clinical and
pathological stages of AD [11] based on the ADNI cohort
and demonstrated that presynaptic dysfunction measured
by CSF GAP43 occurs prior to AD typical neurodegeneration
and predicts faster cognitive decline [12]. We
are currently measuring GAP43 concentrations in plasma
in the GHABS cohort and evaluating its suitability as a
plasma synaptic biomarker of AD in the Chinese aging
population.
The GHABS project also supports and fertilizes new
diagnosis methods for early AD diagnosis from academics
and pharmaceutical industries. GHABS has been
Fig. 5 The general design and goals of the Greater-Bay-Area Healthy Aging Brain Study cohort
Liu et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2024) 16:84 Page 13 of 16
committed to co-developing early diagnostic tools since
its inception, including fluid biomarkers, new antibodies,
brain PET instruments, and new PET tracers. In Shenzhen
Bay Laboratory, Dr. Qiyu Peng’s group are dedicated
to developing high-performance and low-cost brain PET/
CT scanner and wearable brain PET/CT scanner [72].
The GHABS plans to support the clinical verification of
the novel brain PET/CT instruments, as AD is one of the
main neurodegenerative diseases that require a braindedicated
PET/CT instrument. GHABS is also exploring
adjusting the Aβ PET imaging protocols for clinical diagnosis
by shortening the scanning time or reducing trace
dose using brain PET/CT scanners with high spatial resolution
and detection sensitivity. In the future, GHABS
will also facilitate AD clinical trials.
In this study, we, for the first time, investigated the
abnormal alterations of plasma Aβ42, plasma Aβ42/Aβ40,
plasma p-Tau181, plasma GFAP, plasma NfL, Aβ PET, tau
PET, hippocampal volume, and AD-signature cortical
thickness across the different clinical stages of AD based
on a Chinese aging cohort in Guangdong-Hong Kong-
Macao Greater-Bay-Area. This showed that SCD individuals
had significantly higher plasma p-Tau181 and plasma
GFAP than the NC individuals, suggesting that SCD
may be related to early increases in plasma p-Tau181 and
plasma GFAP. In addition, CI individuals (MCI or dementia)
had abnormal changes in plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181,
and NfL, and Aβ PET, tau PET, hippocampal volume,
and AD-signature cortical thickness compared to the CU
(NC or SCD) individuals. Moreover, the frequencies of
plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 positive and plasma p-Tau181 positive
(NC; 5.9%, SCD: 8.2%, MCI: 25.3%, Dementia: 64.9%) and
Aβ PET positivity (NC; 25.6%, SCD: 22.5%, MCI: 47.7%,
Dementia: 89.3%) were reported for the first time. The
overall Aβ-PET positivity rates of NC, MCI, and dementia
in C-PAS, an eastern China cohort, were 26.9%, 44.5%,
and 85.8%, respectively [73], which was similar to the
findings of the GHABS cohort. In general, the frequencies
of Aβ PET positivity were in accordance with previous
reports [74–76].
According to the latest NIA-AA research framework
proposed by Jack and colleagues in AAIC 2023,
it has been suggested to use a combination of plasma
Aβ42/Aβ40 and plasma p-Tau rather than them alone to
identify individuals with a high risk of AD. However, our
findings indicate that using plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 positive
and plasma p-Tau181 positive (A+/T+) may be only able
to capture 23.0%, 36.4%, 53.4%, and 72.7% of Aβ PET
positivity in NC, SCD, MCI, and dementia individuals
respectively. Considering using A-/T + and A+/T- defined
by plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and plasma p-Tau181 in addition to
A+/T + to identify individuals with a high risk of AD, the
frequencies of abnormal plasma biomarkers increased by
46.2%, 44.4%, 73.6%, and 93.0% for NC, SCD, MCI, and
Dementia respectively. Future investigation is required to
determine whether A-/T + or A+/T- individuals defined
by plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and plasma p-Tau181 have evidence
of Aβ plaques, tau tangles, brain atrophy, and cognitive
decline.
In summary, we adapt the standard ADNI protocols to
collect cognitive assessments, fluid biomarkers, and neuroimaging
data to create a community-based observable
AD cohort in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater
Bay Area of China. The GHABS cohort is expected to
identify novel biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques
for early detection, determine the appropriate time window
for AD intervention, and explore AD’s pathological
features and progression patterns, especially during the
asymptomatic stage of AD in South China’s aging population.
We reported for the first time the pathophysiology
characterization of plasma biomarkers, Aβ PET, tau
PET, hippocampal atrophy, and AD-signature cortical
thinning, as well as the prevalence of Aβ PET positivity
in a Chinese community aging cohort in the Guangdong-
Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China. These
findings provide important guidance towards designing
standard AD community cohorts in South China and
offer novel insights into understanding the characteristics
of abnormal AD pathologies changes in South China’s
older population.
