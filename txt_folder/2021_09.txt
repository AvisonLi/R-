Abstract
In aging populations, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated
with better cognitive function, slower rates of cognitive decline, and lower risk
of developing dementia. Animal studies have shown that diets rich in omega-3 PUFAs
reduce blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption associated with aging, but this has yet to
be observed in humans.
Forty-five healthy subjects (mean age, 76 years) were recruited and underwent cognitive
assessment (verbal learning and memory, language, processing speed, executive
function, and motor control) and measurement of PUFAs. Forty of the same subjects
also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure BBB integrity (Ktrans
using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI).
The long chain omega-3 score (DHA+EPA) was negatively correlatedwith Ktrans values
in the internal capsule, indicating higher omega-3 levels were associated with greater
BBB integrity in this region (r = –0.525, p = .004). Trends were observed for a positive
correlation between the long chain omega-3 score and bothmemory and language
scores, but not with executive function, speed, or motor control. The omega-6 score
was not significantly correlated with any cognitive scores or Ktrans values.
The significant correlations between long chain omega-3 levels and BBB integrity provide
a possiblemechanism by which omega-3 PUFAs are associated with brain health.

1 INTRODUCTION
As no cure for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has yet been discovered
and treatment options are limited, there is an urgent need to focus
efforts on primary prevention as the number of adults with the disease
is expected to triple over the next three decades (Brookmeyer

et al., 2007). Identification of modifiable risk factors such as diet and
understanding their mechanisms of action are critical to interventions.
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are predominantly
received through dietary sources, have been associated with
better cognitive function (Bowman et al., 2012;Kalmijn et al., 2004; van
Gelder et al., 2007), slower rates of cognitive decline (van Gelder et al.,
Brain Behav. 2021;11:e2273. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/brb3 1 of 10

2007), and an overall lower risk of developing dementia (Barberger-
Gateau et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2003). Neuroanatomically, higher
omega-3 PUFA intake has been associated cross-sectionally with
larger gray matter volume in healthy older adults (Conklin et al., 2007;
Tan et al., 2012; Titova et al., 2013) and longitudinally with lower
rates of atrophy in the hippocampus and amygdala in communitydwelling
adults over the age of 65 (Samieri et al., 2012). However,
the basis for these relationships is not completely understood in
humans.
Research on animals has been highly suggestive that diet impacts
cognition through maintenance of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
(Davidson et al., 2012; Kanoski et al., 2010; Sparks et al., 2000; Takechi
et al., 2013). Animal models have shown that diets rich in omega-3
PUFAs reduce BBB disruption associated with aging (Kuo et al., 2010)
and poor diet (Takechi et al., 2013). TheBBBhas long been implicated in
neurodegeneration and AD (Farrall & Wardlaw, 2009; Zlokovic, 2011
), and omega-3 PUFA supplementation in murine models decreased
the amount of Aβ and neuronal loss in the brain (Hooijmans et al.,
2012).
Existing studies of the BBB in humans (Farrall & Wardlaw, 2009)
have almost entirely relied on either examinations of the cerebral
spinal fluid (CSF), which gives no spatial information about where
leakage occurs and requires an invasive lumbar puncture, or positron
emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) exams,
which utilize harmful radiation. Previous magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) studies of the BBB have had reduced sensitivity due to limited
data acquisition and postprocessing techniques (Starr et al., 2009; Su
et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2006). More sophisticated dynamic contrast
enhanced (DCE) MR techniques have recently been developed, which
allow accurate detection of subtle changes in BBB integrity (Barnes
et al., 2015; Cramer et al., 2015; Montagne et al., 2015; Taheri et al.,
2011). These new advances allow cognitive decline and BBB integrity
to be carefully and noninvasively examined in humans. They have
also provided evidence to suggest that reduced BBB integrity is a
key mechanism early in cognitive decline and AD (Huisa et al., 2015;
Montagne et al., 2015; Nation et al., 2019). Specifically, studies have
shown a reduction of BBB integrity in the hippocampus to be associated
with aging and additional loss of BBB integrity in individuals with
mild cognitive impairment, a stage preceding dementia, compared to
cognitively intact age-matched controls (Montagne et al., 2015). However,
whether specific dietary factors, including omega-3 PUFAs, are
associated with preserving BBB integrity has not yet been investigated
in humans.
This study explores the relationship among omega-3 PUFAs, cognitive
function, and BBB integrity in a healthy elderly adult population,
thereby secondarily considering the utility of measuring BBB integrity
with MRI as an early, noninvasive, and sensitive biomarker of cognitive
impairment risk.We hypothesize that higher levels of omega-3 PUFAs
will be inversely associated with Ktrans levels measured using DCEMRI,
an indicator of BBB integrity, which may help to preserve cognitive
function in aging. We preliminarily investigate whether associations
are specific to brain regions for which BBB changes could affect
cognition.
2 METHODS
2.1 Participants
The Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) is a prospective cohort study
of over 96,000 members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in
the United States and Canada. During 2002–2007, mostly Caucasian
(65.3%) and African-American (26.9%) adult men and women with
a mean age of 59 years (range 30–110 years) were enrolled and
completed a 50-page baseline questionnaire, which included sections
on dietary, demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle factors (Butler
et al., 2008). The cohort is healthy: at baseline, high proportions
reported being in excellent health. Forty-five percent of cohort members
follow vegetarian diets (Rizzo et al., 2013) and nonvegetarians
consume lower amounts of meat compared to the general US population
(Rizzo et al., 2013; Tantamango-Bartley et al., 2013). Note that
1.1% are current smokers and 6.6% drink alcohol (Butler et al., 2008).
About 28% had omega-3 scores >8% (considered low vascular risk,
Harris & Von Schacky, 2004), 65% had scores from 4% to 8% (intermediate
vascular risk), and 7% had scores ≤4% (high vascular risk).
Since the cohort has aged, and the majority of the cohort is elderly, the
AHS-2 presents an opportunity to study age-related chronic diseases.
In 2016, we identified 2685 members of the cohort for whom
study records indicated were 60 years or older, community-dwelling
and living within 75 miles of Loma Linda University (LLU). During
2016–2018, 199 were reached by telephone and invited to participate
in the AHS-2 Cognitive and Neuroimaging (AHS2-CAN) substudy
(Gatto et al., 2020). Of those, 168 (84%) agreed to participate and
were screened for eligibility. Participants were excluded if they did
not understand and speak English proficiently or had any acute medical
conditions that could adversely impact cognitive function. One
hundred and thirty-two otherwise healthy adults were enrolled in
the AHS2-CAN study and completed the baseline study procedures,
which included cognitive and physical assessments. Approximately 1
year later, participants were invited to return for a follow-up cognitive
assessment and brain MRI scan. Additional exclusions were made
for a diagnosed neurological condition, such as Parkinson’s disease,
epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis; a history of brain tumor, stroke, or other
focal brain injury or head trauma; any acute medical condition, such
as infections, nutritional deficiencies, or adverse drug reactions; a
pacemaker or other implanted device; a history of kidney disease or
diabetes; or claustrophobia. Forty-five AHS2-CAN study participants
completed repeated cognitive assessment; 40 of those also completed
the MRI scan. Of the five participants who did not complete the MRI,
one had metal in his/her body, one was unable to lie flat due to back
problems, and three declined due to symptoms of claustrophobia or
concerns related to the contrast agent.

2.2 Cognitive assessment
During an in-person visit, participants were administered a 2-h neuropsychological
battery, which included tests of verbal learning and
memory [Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)(Rey, 1964), and
Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale–4th edition
(Wechsler et al., 2008)], attention (Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale–4th edition, WAIS-IV (Wechsler et al.,
2008)), processing speed (Coding subtest of the WAIS-IV (Wechsler
et al., 2008), Stroop Test (Golden et al., 1978), Trail-Making Test
(Reitan & Wolfson, 1993)), language (Boston Naming Test (Kaplan
et al., 1983), FAS (Benton et al., 1989), Animals (Benton et al., 1989)),
estimated premorbid verbal intelligence (American National Adult
Reading Test, AMNART(Grober & Sliwinski, 1991)), and global cognitive
functioning [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)(Folstein
et al., 1975)] by trained psychometrists. The finger-tapping test (FTT)
(Strauss et al., 2006) was administered as a measure of fine motor
control.
To reduce the number of variables in analyses, four composite
cognitive scores were created to reflect domain-specific abilities
of memory (RAVLT Immediate Recall, RAVLT Delayed Recall, Logical
Memory I and Logical Memory II); language (Boston Naming
Test and Animals); processing speed (Trail-Making Test Part A and
Coding); and executive function (FAS, Trail-Making Test Part B, and
Digit Span). Individual test scores were first standardized by centering
around the sample means and standard deviations; composite
scores were then computed as averages of the individual component
test scores. A fifth domain, motor control, was assessed with
a single measure, the FTT, which was computed as the combined
average score over five trials for both hands, with each trial representing
the number of consecutive finger taps on a key completed
within 10 s.
2.3 Neuroimaging
The MRI was collected on a 3T (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen,
Germany) scanner using a 32-channel array head coil. Total imaging
time was 45 min and included 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE with,
TR = 1950 ms, TE = 2.3 ms, FA = 8 degrees, FOV = 240 × 240, matrix
256 × 256, acquisition time = 4:30, and slice thickness = 0.9 mm. A B1
corrected T1 map was created from four images with FA = 4,11,17,23,
TR = 15, TE = 2.1 with the FOV and matrix the same as the DCE acquisition.
A standard dose (0.2 ml/kg) of Multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine)
was injected 45 s after the start of DCE sequence at 2 ml/s
using a power injector. DCE was acquired in a coronal orientation with
TR = 3.76 ms, TE = 1.35 ms, flip angle = 15◦, slice thickness = 5 mm,
FOV = 220 × 178 mm, matrix = 256 × 208, temporal resolution
= 15.3 s, and total acquisition time = 12:44. FLAIR images were
acquired with TR = 9000, TE = 81, TI = 2500, FOV = 220 × 213 mm,
matrix = 320 × 217, and slice thickness = 4 mm with
1.2mmgap.
2.4 Fatty acids
A drop of blood was collected on filter paper that was pre-treated
with an antioxidant cocktail (Fatty Acid Preservative Solution, FAPS)
and allowed to dry at room temperature for 15 min. The dried blood
spots (DBS) were shipped to OmegaQuant (Sioux Falls, SD) for fatty
acid analysis as follows. One punch of the DBS was transferred to a
screw-cap glass vial followed by addition of BTM (methanol containing
14% boron trifluoride, toluene, methanol; 35:30:35 v/v/v) (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis,MO). The vialwas briefly vortexed and heated in a hot
bath at 100°C for 45 min. After cooling, hexane (EMD Chemicals, USA)
andHPLCgrade waterwere added, the tubes were recapped, vortexed,
and centrifuged to help separate layers. An aliquot of the hexane layer
was transferred to a GC vial. GC was carried out using a GC-2010 Gas
Chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Columbia,MD) equippedwith
a SP-2560, 100-m fused silica capillary column (0.25mminternal diameter,
0.2 μmfilm thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA).
Fatty acids were identified by comparison with a standard mixture
of fatty acids characteristic of red blood cells (RBC) (GLC OQA;
NuCheck Prep, Elysian, MN), which was also used to construct
individual fatty acid calibration curves. Fatty acid composition was
expressed as a percent of total identified fatty acids. In order to estimate
fatty intake over a period of 120 days, the typical lifespan of erythrocytes
(Arab, 2003; Tan et al., 2012), two RBC index scores were
calculated by regressing component fatty acids with proprietary equations
(OmegaQuant).
A long chain omega-3 score reflected the combined amount of
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; cis n-3 20:5n) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA; cis n-3 22:6) in the erythrocytes. An omega-6 score reflected
arachidonic acid (AA; cis n-6 20:4) in the erythrocytes. The correlation
between thewhole blood andRBCEPAandDHAlevelswas very strong
(r > 0.95), while the AA correlation wasmoderate (r = 0.50).
2.5 Image processing
FLAIR images were used to determine the volume of white matter
lesions. Lesions were segmented by the lesion prediction algorithm
(Schmidt, 2017) as implemented in the LST toolbox version 3.0.0 (www.
statistical-modelling.de/lst.html) for SPM.
DCE data were processed with the software package ROCKETSHIP
(Barnes et al., 2015). The dynamic DCE series was motion
corrected using AFNI 3dvolreg. First, brain extraction was performed
using the automated brain extration tool HD-BET (Isensee et al.,
2019). AFNI 3dvolreg was applied using a brain mask excluding
the scalp which moves independently from the brain; heptic interpolation
was utilized to minimize Gibbs ringing. An arterial input
function (AIF) was selected from the jugular veins. The Patlak model,
the most sensitive model for detecting subtle changes in the BBB
(Barnes et al., 2015), was used to calculate Ktrans values as measures
of BBB integrity, with higher Ktrans values reflecting worse BBB
integrity. Regions of Interest (ROIs) were manually drawn in the
4 of 10 BARNES ET AL.
hippocampus, superior corona radiata, corpus callosum, thalamus,
caudate nucleus, and internal capsule, as these regions have been
shown to have BBB changes associated with cognitive changes (Montagne
et al., 2015). ROIs drawn in an areawhere the Patlak model failed
to converge on a positive Ktrans value for a given individual subject
were excluded from analysis; this resulted in an exclusion of 31(13%)
of 240 possible ROIs. Given the limited sample size and exploratory
nature of this study,we did not examine the left and right sides of brain
regions separately. For the hippocampus, both sides were drawn and
then averaged together; for all other regions, the ROI was preferentially
drawn on the right side, unless there were artifacts in the region,
in which case the left was used. ROI definition was done blinded to any
subject information about study participants and finalized before any
statistical analyses.
The study was approved by the Loma Linda University Institutional
Review Board, andwritten informed consentwas obtained from all participants.
2.6 Statistics
Age- and sex-adjusted Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated
between fatty acid scores and the composite cognitive scores.
Pearson correlation coefficients between fatty acid scores and Ktrans
values, and between Ktrans values and composite cognitive scoreswere
adjusted for age, sex, and white matter lesion (WML) volume. A twotailed
p-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses
used SPSS 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). Due to the small
sample size and the exploratory nature of this study, we chose to limit
the number to statistical comparisons as much as possible instead of
performing multiple comparison corrections. As such, for fatty acids
analysis, 24 variables were collected reflecting the levels of individual
fatty acids, but only two composite fatty acids variables (omega-
3 score and omega-6 score) were analyzed. For cognitive testing, 17
variableswere collected, but five cognitive composite scoreswere analyzed
(composite scores for memory, language, processing speed, executive
function, andmotor control). For DCE data, only six brain regions
were analyzed (hippocampus, superior corona radiata, corpus callosum,
thalamus, caudate nucleus, and internal capsule). The analyzed
variables from the three primary outcomes were compared resulting in
52 statistical tests. For any statistically significant correlations (p<.05)
between composites,we conducted post-hoc analyses to examine individual
correlations between the component variables; this resulted in
36 post hoc statistical comparisons. The data that support the findings
of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable
request.

demographic factors between participants who participated in the MRI
portion of the study (n = 40) and those who did not (Table 2).
Although we found no significant associations between omega-3
scores and cognition, the long chain omega-3 score was positively correlated
with memory (Figure 1, r = 0.292; p = .058) and language
(r = 0.267, p = .083), but did not reach statistical significance. Processing
speed, executive function, and motor control did not show an associationwith
omega-3 (Table 3). The omega-6 index was not statistically
significantly correlated with any cognitive measures (Table 3).
The long chain omega-3 score was negatively correlated with
medianKtrans values in the internal capsule (Figure 2, r=−0.3, p=.004).

analyses found that the correlation in the internal capsule was driven
by a correlation with EPA (Table S1, r = −0.542, p = .003) and significantly

Of the ROIs we attempted to analyze, 13% were excluded as the

to excessive noise or motion artifacts in that area of the image.
The Ktrans values which did not converge were distributed across
participants. However, since this is a substantial number of samples
to exclude, we also performed all statistical analyses considering
those regions as Ktrans = 0. While this approach decreased the
strength of the correlations, it did not change any of the statistically

4 DISCUSSION
Omega-3 PUFAs are essential components of cell membrane phospholipid
bilayers and are also concentrated in synaptic membranes in the
brain. They play an important role in brain physiology and biological
activities, such as by increasing fluidity of neuronal membranes,
modifying endothelial function and cerebral blood flow, synthesizing
anti-inflammatory mediators, and slowing degradation of nerve tissues
(O’ Donovan et al., 2019). High levels of omega-3 PUFAs in the blood
have also been associated with reduced cognitive decline in normal
aging (Beydoun et al., 2007). Studies have shown a beneficial effect of
omega-3 PUFAs in neurological disorders due to anti-inflammatory,
anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective properties (Arab, 2003; Brookmeyer
et al., 2007; Campbell et al., 2019; Harris & Thomas, 2010; Lin
et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2013).
In our study, the long chain omega-3 score was marginally associated
with cognitive performance in the domains of memory and language,
which are the most prominent areas of cognitive impairment
associated with AD. Thus, our finding is consistent with previous literature
which has demonstrated similar associations between omega-3
levels, memory function, and risk of AD (Milte et al., 2011; Tan et al.,

2012). Furthermore, higher omega-3 levels have also been shown to
reduce volume loss in the hippocampus, a region of the brain critical
for learning and memory (Pottala et al., 2014). The relationship
between omega-3 PUFAs and other cognitive domains, including speed
and executive function, is less clear, with some studies reporting a positive
association (Milte et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2012), while others report
no association (Ammann et al., 2013; Sydenham et al., 2012 ) or a negative
association (Danthiir et al., 2014). Consistent with this literature,
we did not observe associations with cognitive performance in the
areas of processing speed or executive function.
Studies on animals have shown that omega-3 PUFAs are important
for preserving BBB integrity (Andreone et al., 2017). Our observation
of an inverse correlation between long chain omega-3 PUFAs and
Ktrans values in the internal capsule are thus in line with what would
be expected from animal studies. To our knowledge, our study is the
first to observe this in humans. The internal capsule is comprised of
major ascending and descending white matter tracts, and significant
changes in BBB integrity of the internal capsule have been measured in
people with vascular risk factors and mild cognitive impairment (Montagne
et al., 2020). At this time, it is not clear why associations were
only detected in the internal capsule. It could be that the internal capsule
is more protected by the omega-3 PUFA, the BBB measurements
are more sensitive in that area, or maybe associations in other brain
regions were not detected due to insufficient statistical power. Our
results provide evidence that the integrity of theBBBmay be one of the
mechanisms by which long chain omega-3 PUFAs may be linked with
brain health and protect from disease.
EPA is important in reducing neuroinflammation by competing
against arachidonic acid for access to the same enzymes needed to produce
pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes,
leukotrienes, and other oxidized derivatives. Inflammatory mediators
are known to disrupt the BBB leading to neurological dysfunction
(Obermeier et al., 2013). In our study, correlations between long
chain omega-3 PUFAs and Ktrans were driven by EPA, adding evidence
of the potential importance of this omega-3 PUFA in maintaining BBB
integrity.
Finger tapping, which measures how quickly an individual can make
repetitive taps on a key using their index finger, is a commonly used test
of fine motor control of the upper extremities and requires functional
integrity of the corticospinal tract, cerebellar motor circuitry, and proprioceptive
pathways (Campbell et al., 2019). Age-related declines
in finger tapping frequency have been well-documented (Bowden &
McNulty, 2013; Rosjat et al., 2018). Our study found a strong correlation
between finger tapping and Ktrans in the superior corona radiata, a
region that includes motor fibers of the corticospinal tract which help
regulate fine motor functions of the upper extremities. A disruption in
the BBB in corona radiata can affect fine motor functions, which also
provides further evidence that disruption of the BBB is a key process in
normal aging.
This was a small exploratory study and thus did not find statistically
significant correlations between fatty acids and neuropsychological
measures or between Ktrans values, and some of the
neuropsychological measures may have been a result of our being
underpowered. Our cohort was exceptionally healthy with a relatively
low rate of overall cognitive impairment and had a narrow range of
variability in fatty acid values. In the general population, omega-3
scores of ≤4% are considered high vascular risk, 4%–8% intermediate
risk, and >8% is considered low risk (Harris & Von Schacky, 2004).
Around 65% of the study cohort had omega-3 scores putting them in
an intermediate vascular risk group and only 7% was in the high-risk
group. Thus, a more heterogeneous sample with a greater number
of participants with low omega-3 scores would be useful for future
studies. With cross-sectional data, we cannot infer the directionality
or temporality of the associations that we detected. It could be that
declines in cognitive function precede BBB disruption, but we expect
that reduction of BBB integrity as an underlying mechanism would be

manifested through observable cognitive impairments (Huisa et al.,
2015; Montagne et al., 2015). We adjusted correlations for age, sex,
and white matter lesions, which does not rule out the potential that
other factors such as education or comorbidities could confound the
associations (Dias et al., 2014;Montagne et al., 2020).We also did not
adjust correlations with omega-3 and omega-6 scores for other fatty
acids to examine independent correlations. However, measurements
of the individual fatty acids which contributed to these scores were
expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids. Many of the variables
we examined are not truly independent, so a Bonferroni correction
for multiple testing was not done as this would be overly conservative,
particularly given our limited sample size. Instead, we minimized the
number of comparisons by reducing the number of variables examined
in analyses using composite cognitive scores, omega-3 and 6 scores,
and a limited number of brain regions for Ktrans values. A larger study
whichwould allowmore thorough analysis of individual cognitive tests,
fatty acids, and a more diverse set of BBB measurements is merited.
In conclusion, we found significant correlations between long chain
omega-3 levels and BBB integrity and cognition, providing evidence
of a possible mechanism by which omega-3 may contribute to brain
health.
