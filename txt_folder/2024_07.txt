    ABSTRACT
    Background: Human populations are rapidly ageing worldwide due to declining birth rates and rising life expectancies. This
    profound demographic shift presents complex public health challenges. Synthesizing evidence on key public health issues
    impacting ageing populations and policy strategies is required to address these needs.
    Methods: The study employs narrative literature review based on the PubMed database. Data have been extracted on public health
    challenges to ageing populations and its recommended policy solutions.
    Results: The key public health challenges identified include rising chronic disease burden, risks for preventable multi-morbidities
    and co-morbidities, disability and dependencies, mental health issues, caregiving gaps, long-term care system deficiencies, health
    inequities, healthcare access barriers, end-of-life care needs, financial instability, ageism/elder abuse, adverse built environments,
    climate/disaster threats, and social isolation. Evidence-based policy responses span interventions in healthcare, social services,
    urban planning, emergency preparedness, economics, technology, anti-ageism advocacy and so on.
    Conclusions: Proactively addressing the array of public health challenges faced by rapidly growing ageing populations globally
    requires implementing collaborative, multisectoral policy solutions focused on promoting healthy, equitable, and socially engaged
    ageing. Healthcare systems, communities, and policies must be optimized to meet the needs of elderly people and tap into their
    strengths.
