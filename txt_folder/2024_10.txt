As population aging becomes the new demographic norm in China, its workforce structure is changing, and its
demographic dividend is about to disappear. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been experiencing rapid progress in
the last few years, and it is becoming an important tool to address the impact and challenges of an aging population.
Therefore, this research introduces population aging and artificial intelligence into agricultural production,
focusing on the effects of population aging on food security and the function played by artificial
intelligence in it. From an empirical study conducted based on provincial panel data, the following conclusions
arise. First, population aging in rural China has not negatively impacted food security, so there is no need to be
overly pessimistic about the inevitable aging of the rural population. Second, AI has a favorable moderating
function on the effects of population aging on food security. Third, the moderating effect of AI is heterogeneous.
Compared with other provinces, AI can play a strongly positive moderating effect in central and west regions and
major grain-selling areas. Based on the above findings, this paper proposes targeted policy recommendations on
protecting food security in the context of artificial intelligence and population aging.
1. Introduction
An aging demographic is a universal problem in a great number of
countries around the globe and is most pronounced in developed
countries, but it is not uncommon for developing ones to also experience
population aging (Harper, 2014). The course of demographic aging has
already commenced and will speed up in the coming decades. Bloom
et al. (2015) argue that every country will experience an aging population
between now and 2030. Over the past six decades, the proportion
of the world’s population aged 60 and over has increased only slightly,
from 8 to 10 %. But over the next four decades, this group is expected to
rise to 22 % of the total population, jumping from 800 million to 2
billion. As the largest developing country, China encountered a negative
population increase in 2022. It implies that China’s demographic dividend
is gradually fading, and that the Lewis inflection point has
occurred. China’s aging population over the last few decades has
become more problematic, largely as a result of two forces: one is the
continued and rapid decrease in fertility rate, and the other is the rise in
the average remaining lifespan of the elderly due to economic and social
progress.
Population aging has a continuous and far-reaching effect on all aspects
of China’s economy and society, and its implications have received
the attention of many scholars. Many academics summarize the negative
impacts of demographic aging in the following ways. First, seniors need
more health care, which can lead to higher healthcare costs. This can
place a huge burden on younger generations in terms of health care costs
or lead to large government deficits. Second, population aging has a
double effect on the industrial structure. Third, an aging population
reduces the effective supply of labor and slows down labor productivity.
Fourth, it decreases the savings rate, with younger people saving less
and elder people consuming their savings, ultimately leading to less
investment. Fifth, there is less enthusiasm to engage in work and resistance
to reform for older people, resulting in a lack of economic dynamism
(Choi and Shin, 2015; Vogel et al., 2017; Lee and Shin, 2019). In
addition to these issues, many scholars find that population aging can
also affect food security by impacting human capital (Lee and Yuan,

Food security is a dynamic and effective balance of production,
distribution, and consumption of food in a country or region to ensure
that all people at all times have enough food available for their survival
and health (Prosekov and Ivanova, 2018). Global hunger and malnutrition
are still on the rise today. FAO statistics indicate that there are
still 925 million undernourished people worldwide, which means that
food insecurity and malnutrition are still widespread. Food security is a
national concern. The ability to ensure food security directly affects their
lives, social stability, and sustainable economic development (Jones
et al., 2013; Ashraf and Javed, 2023). China’s food security has also
received attention from the international community, as it has always
placed food production at the foundation of its national economy. Over
the past few decades, the food security level of China has been continuously
increasing, and the problem of subsistence has been solved.
However, food security in China is still facing many challenges including
the reduction of arable land, increasing pressure on resources and
environment, rising labor costs, rapid urbanization, and the rigid growth
trend of non-farm payrolls (Wang et al., 2009; Du et al., 2014; Ghose,
2014). Today China’s food security will also be challenged by an aging
rural population.
As the population increases and consumption expands, China’s per
capita arable land area will further decrease, while the per capita food
consumption level will further increase, so population aging will have a
great impact on China’s food security. Nowadays, the growing trend of
an aging demographic in rural areas has caused many people to worry
about food security. Whether this will influence food security has raised
the concern of many scholars (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2021). Scholars
currently hold two main views. Such an aging demographic affects the
human capital and physical strength of the labor force in rural areas.
One group of scholars believes that population aging will jeopardize
food security by reducing the physical strength of the rural labor force,
the supply of labor and the input of agricultural factors (Rigg et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2023). Other scholars argue that older people have more
agricultural labor time and experience, and that with the development
of agricultural mechanization and the convergence of production decisions,
the aging of the population will not have a negative impact on
food production (Guo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016).
In this context, many scholars have explored the factors affecting
food security from multiple perspectives and explored the path to
guaranteeing food security (Khan et al., 2009; Thou, 2010; Gozgor and
Memis, 2015; Liu and Zhou, 2021; Hossain et al., 2023). As big data,
hardware, and algorithms advance rapidly, artificial intelligence (AI) is
evolving at a rapid pace, providing new tools to safeguard food security
(Wu et al., 2022). Artificial intelligence causes profound transformations
in China’s economy and brings about great changes to society (Suki
et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Hassan et al., 2023; Usman et al., 2023).
Artificial intelligence is the scientific engineering of manufacturing
intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs (Lee
et al., 2024; Moor, 2006). Over the past few years, AI has gained the
attention of various major countries, which are making great efforts to
develop artificial intelligence. As one example, China considers AI to be
a fresh drive for economic growth. The State Council in 2017 published
the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan,
reflecting the importance attached to AI as a technology at the national
policy level.
Economists have been very concerned about the effects of the advances
in technology on an economy, while at the same time farreaching
economic and social changes can be caused by the rapid evolution
of AI (Lee et al., 2022a; Zhao et al., 2022). In the last few decades,
research on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic development
is proliferating, ranging from economic growth and technological
innovation to income disparity, sparking widespread interest among
economists (Autor, 2015; Arntz et al., 2016; Acemoglu and Restrepo,
2017; Chen et al., 2022a, 2022b; Tian et al., 2023). It is clearly of great
significance to study the economic and social effects of AI. With the
development of the Internet, big data, digital economy, Internet of
Things (IoT), and other emerging technologies, technologies related to
AI are also constantly being applied to agriculture with the goal of
continuously promoting the modernization and informatization of
agriculture and providing new tools to secure food safety (Wang et al.,
2022; Engås et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024).
Is the aging of the rural demographic really going to negatively
impact China’s food security? What role does AI play in ensuring food
security? This paper presents AI’s role in the process of population aging
and its influence on food security, studying the causal relationships
among population aging, food security, and AI.
To address the above issues, this paper focuses on an empirical study
using China provincial balanced panel data to investigate the effects of
population aging on food security and the role played by AI in it. The
main research process runs as follows. First, using a benchmark
regression, we find that population aging does not hurt food security.
Second, we employ a range of methods to conduct robustness analysis,
including instrumental variables approach, re-measurement of population
aging, winsorizing the variables, and addition of control variables to
improve the reliability of the underlying findings. Third, we find that AI
has a positive influence on population aging’s impact on food security
through the moderating effect model, threshold regression model, and
DID model. The positive influence is heterogeneous, which is verified by
the subsample regression. Fig. 1 illustrates the empirical research
framework of this paper to better understand the research idea herein.
Compared to the relevant literature, the main contributions of this
research are as follows. First, most studies conclude that population
aging negatively impacts food security. This paper presents a new
perspective, showing that population aging does not negatively affect
food security. This study conducts a rigorous empirical investigation to
enrich the existing literature. Second, a new instrumental variable is
constructed to deal with the endogeneity of the model. This study selects
the interaction term between the intensity of family planning policies
and the national elderly dependency ratio in the following year as an
instrumental variable, which exhibits exogeneity and a correlation.
Third, existing research on AI has mainly focused on economic development
and labor markets with few scholars empirically targeting the
impact of AI on agricultural production. This paper introduces AI into
the framework of the impact of population aging on food security and
discusses the heterogeneous role of AI in different regions, filling the gap
in the literature. Fourth, our research adds innovative indicators to
measure the level of AI development in agriculture based on other
works. Most studies use the social fixed asset investment in the information
transmission, computer services, and software industries to
measure the degree of intelligence (Borland and Coelli, 2017). Because
that study targets rural areas, its approach does not accurately measure
the degree of intelligence in rural areas. Since the current use of AI in
agriculture is mainly in industrial robots, our research obtains industrial
robot density in each province at the agricultural level as a measure of
the level of AI development in the agriculture industry.
The rest of this article runs as follows. Section 2 gives a review of the
available related literature. Section 3 conducts an analysis of theories.
Section 4 presents the research methodology including data, variables,
and models. Section 5 reports and provides an analysis of the empirical
results. Section 6 explores the role of AI in agricultural production and

limitations and prospects of the research.
2. Literature review
2.1. Population aging and food security
There is a lot of research about the effects of demographic aging on
agricultural production and food security, but the views and conclusions
of different scholars are still clearly controversial and divergent. One
C.-C. Lee et al.
Technological Forecasting & Social Change 199 (2024) 123062
3
group of scholars believes that population aging has adverse effects on
agricultural production. For example, Rigg et al. (2020) and Liu et al.
(2023) reveal that demographic aging will not just cause a shortage of
agricultural labor, but will also limit agricultural capital investment.
This raises agricultural land resources waste and hinders the progress of
modern agriculture. Ren et al. (2023) find that an aging workforce
indirectly impacts land use efficiency by affecting the input of agricultural
capital. Many scholars argue that the aging of the agricultural labor
force can negatively affect agriculture production from the perspectives
of agricultural production efficiency, land use efficiency, agricultural
labor input and marginal effects of input factors (Li and Sicular, 2013;
Yahya and Lee, 2023).
Another group of scholars believes that the aging of the agricultural
workforce does not negatively impact agricultural development and
food production. Rigg et al. (2020) find that a young farmer labor force
is less efficient than an elderly farm labor force in terms of arable land
use because they devote more time and energy to non-farm industries.
Guo et al. (2015) argue that the adverse effects of population aging come
mainly from the withdrawal of older agricultural labor, as older farmers
themselves are more productive than other farmers. Some researchers
find no obvious negative impacts from such a workforce. The reason for
this is that years of experience in strategies and applying agricultural
mechanization reduce the physical demands of farm production. This
means that agricultural mechanization and experience can compensate
for the physical disadvantages of an older workforce (Qiu et al., 2021).
In terms of productive agricultural services, older agricultural laborer’s
do not have a significant effect on food production efficiency.
Conversely, agricultural productive services such as machine farming
have a significant positive moderating effect (Wang et al., 2016). According
to Tang and Chen (2022), we know that although an aging
agricultural workforce reduces the human capital and physical strength
of the agricultural labor force, it does not negatively impact China’s food
production due to the convergence of production decisions and the
prevalence of outsourcing of agricultural machinery. Li et al. (2022)
employ a panel vector autoregressive model and find a considerable
positive effect of population aging and renewable energy use on green
total factor productivity in agriculture from an energy consumption
perspective.
In accordance with the above analysis, we find that different scholars
analyze the impact of the elderly agricultural labor force on food safety
from various perspectives. Population aging can have complex and
diverse impacts on agricultural production. To sum up, an aging rural
population may affect agricultural production efficiency due to factors
such as declining physical strength. However, population aging may not
necessarily negatively impact food production because modern agricultural
technology, production methods, and social services can
compensate to a certain degree for the deficiency in physical methods of
older agricultural labor.
2.2. Artificial intelligence and population aging
The development of AI has received attention from scholars, and its
effects on economic and social development have been widely studied.
Many scholars believe that AI contributes to economic development in
several ways, including increasing productivity, improving labor productivity,
and promoting innovation (Cami˜na et al., 2020; Lee et al.,
2022a,c; Wang, 2023). In terms of the labor market, current scholarship
suggests that AI has mainly negative substitution effects and positive
creation effects on employment (Frank et al., 2019). Acemoglu and
Restrepo (2018b) study the relationship between AI and the workforce,
finding that the substitution effect itself decreases the need for a workforce,
while the productivity effects improve productivity efficiency by
using cheaper capital to replace labor. This raises the need for labor in
jobs that are not automatically performed.
Some scholars forecast that AI will have a huge impact on the labor
market, replacing many jobs. Qian et al. (2023) find that the direction of
the impact of AI development on labor income shares depends on the
relative speed of machine replacement and new tasks. Machine
replacement makes the wage growth rate smaller than the labor productivity
growth rate, leading to a decline in the labor income share.
Another group of scholars is optimistic about AI’s influence on labor
force employment. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a, 2018b) point out
that advances in technology provide and create more employment and
that industrial intelligence mitigates AI’s effect on the employment
market through both new job creation and productivity effects. David
(2017) examines AI’s impact on the gender wage gap and presents no
significant difference in substituting AI for labor among workers of
different genders. In conclusion, AI enhances productivity, complements

the workforce, but it also has a substitution effect on it. Artificial intelligence
has important and complex implications for economic and
social development.
As population aging gradually becomes the development trend of
society, can AI alleviate the economic and social problems caused by
population aging? Many scholars have looked into the association between
the aging population and AI. Aisa et al. (2023) find that aging
drives automation innovation. Simultaneous increases in longevity can
have a positive impact on the supply of highly skilled older labor, which
in turn has a positive impact on the progress of automation. Through
theoretical and empirical investigations at the country and firm levels,
Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) prove that countries and firms with more
severe aging tend to use AI in productive activities earlier and more
often in order to compensate for the impact of aging. Additionally, AI
and labor exhibit a substitution relationship as well as complementary
substitution and not a crowding-out substitution. AI is able to better
cope with the adverse impacts of aging on growth in the economy, with
regard to production intelligence, return on capital, total factor productivity,
labor force structure, and efficiency of technological innovation,
and promotes high-quality economic development (Chen et al.,
2019). At the same time, the application of AI can narrow the labor gap
caused by population aging and better cope with the workforce gap due
to population aging (Filippi et al., 2023). Therefore, if AI technology can
be used wisely, then it will offer a greater contribution to China’s
economy in the future in the context of aging.
The foregoing discussion demonstrates that AI can effectively alleviate
the labor shortage caused by an aging population and promote the
smooth operation of the economy. However, most research on AI and
population aging focuses on their effects on economic growth and labor
markets with scant literature introducing AI to the effects of population
aging on food security. To fill the gap in the literature, this study
therefore uses provincial-level data from China to investigate further the
role of AI in the process of population aging and how it affects food
security.
3. Theoretical analysis and hypothesis
3.1. Impact of population aging on food security
This paper presents the direct impact of population aging on food
security, starting with an analysis of the characteristics of an elderly
population. As the above literature review suggests, the impact of an
aging population on food security is complex. In this part, we discuss
why population aging does not hurt food security. The following explanations
can be divided into insignificant effects and potentially positive
effects of population aging on food security.
First, the aging of the agricultural workforce directly influences the
availability of labor in quantity as well as the physical strength of the
labor force. However, with the development of farm mechanization and
information technology, modern farm production technology and organization
methods have also greatly reduced the constraints of individual
physical strength (Qiu et al., 2021). This means that food
production is weakly dependent on the labor force but on machines.
Thus, population aging, while reducing the agricultural workforce’s
physical strength and human capital, does not negatively impact food
security.
Second, viewed from the perspective of production methods, China’s
current food production is family-type small-scale production and has
regional characteristics. Mutual imitation and decision convergence
among farmers make the demand for food production homogeneous
regarding technology, machinery, and other factors. This lowers the
demand for labor in the food production process, resulting in no significant
effect of aging on food production (Chen et al., 2022a, 2022b).
Third, in terms of production time, the opportunity cost of the farm
workforce is lower for older laborers who have fewer opportunities and
rewards for off-farm work compared to younger laborers (Rigg et al.,
2018; Zhao et al., 2018). This gives them enough time and energy to
engage in agricultural production. Young farmers who are involved in
part-time work are mainly employed in non-farm industries, their
agricultural production is carried out in the leftover time of their nonfarm
work, and their management time in the field is much less than
that of older farmers (Rigg et al., 2020; Hussain and Lee, 2022; Ren
et al., 2023). Therefore, the intensity of crop cultivation is significantly
higher among purely elderly farmers than part-time young farmers.
Fourth, in terms of human capital, although older agricultural laborers
are physically disadvantaged, their technical efficiency in agricultural
production is even higher than that of younger laborers due to
their rich production experience and higher concentration in agricultural
production. How farming practices such as fertilizers, pesticides
and agrarian films are utilized depends on the agricultural knowledge
and farming techniques that farmers have. The older and more experienced
the agricultural labor force is, the more they know how to use the
right amount of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. to enhance food production
efficiency (Li et al., 2016).
While an aging workforce reduces the quantity and physical strength
of the workforce, modern agricultural techniques and production
methods have become much less demanding in terms of these conditions.
Factors such as mechanical substitution, socialized services, and
collective decision-making also make up for the passive effects of an
aging population. Conversely, older agricultural laborers themselves
have more sufficient time, energy, and experience than younger agricultural
laborers, in turn benefiting agricultural production and food
security. Thus, the first hypothesis is proposed as follows:
Hypothesis 1. The population aging does not adversely alter food
security.
3.2. The role of artificial intelligence
The fundamental contradictions that prevent the modernization of
China’s agriculture encompass the existing labor-based production
model, the continuous reduction of the labor force, the scarcity of
agricultural resources per capita, the low utilization of agricultural resources,
the rejuvenation of new farmers, and the reduction of the
workforce. Some essential ways to resolve the above contradictions
include relying on intelligent equipment to achieve precise, automated,
and intelligent agricultural production and improving agricultural productivity,
resource utilization, and land yield (Labarthe et al., 2021;
Johnson et al., 2022; Wang and Lee, 2023). Agricultural robots will be
increasingly used in agriculture and the food industry as technology
develops, and labor shortages due to an aging population and a high
degree of automation are required (Zhang et al., 2020; Issa et al., 2022).
Under the background of rapid progress in the digital economy and the
growing level of information technology in agriculture, the level of
agricultural intelligence is also increasing (Asongu et al., 2018; Pauget
and Dammak, 2019). Artificial intelligence technologies for land and
irrigation control, climate prediction, plant cultivation, disease prediction,
and livestock management make up critical functions that help
ensure the sustainability of agriculture (Filho et al., 2022; Shaikh et al.,
2022). Agricultural AI technologies are used throughout the course of
farm production. Indeed, the implementation of precise, automated, and
intelligent agricultural production through intelligent equipment reduces
workforce needs, lowers labor’s physical requirements, and improves
agricultural productivity, resource utilization, and land yield,
thereby mitigating the effects of population aging on food security.
Population aging can adversely affect both the physical strength and
human capital of the agricultural workforce, which are mitigated by the
application of AI, which can then effectively replace agricultural labor in
physical activities. An older agricultural workforce, while under a
physical handicap, has an advantage over the younger agricultural
workforce in terms of production experience and production focus.
Therefore, artificial intelligence can, on the one hand, compensate for
C.-C. Lee et al.
Technological Forecasting & Social Change 199 (2024) 123062
5
the physical shortcomings of an older workforce and, on the other hand,
make greater use of the advantages of an experienced older workforce to
achieve more refined farming, maintain land productivity, and guarantee
food security. The higher the degree of AI application is, the better
it is to make use of the experience and time advantages of an older
workforce, to compensate for the physical deficiencies of such a workforce,
further exploit the spillover effects of elderly human capital, and
to promote the improvement of agricultural production. Thus, the second
hypothesis is proposed as follows:
Hypothesis 2. AI plays a positive role in the impact of population
aging on food security.
4. Empirical models
4.1. Econometric models
4.1.1. Benchmark model
To investigate the fundamental connection between population
aging and food security, this study employs the following benchmark
model throughout the paper:
Foodi,t = α0 +α1Agingi,t +
Σ7
k=2
αkcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t , (1)
where i indicates province and t denotes time (i = 1, …, 30; t = 2008, …,
2020). Foodi,t is the dependent variable, representing food security.
Agingi,t is the independent variable, indicating the level of population
aging, while controli,t is a series of control variables including food price
index, urbanization rate, government finance, agricultural expenditure,
technological progress and irrigation capacity. Lastly, ωi represents
province fixed effects, γt represents year fixed effects, εi,t means the error
term, and α0 is the constant term, where αk (k = 1, …, 7) are the estimated
coefficients.
4.1.2. Moderating effect model
This study uses a moderating effect model to verify the moderating
mechanism of AI.
Foodi,t =b0 +b1Agingi,t +b2Moderatingi,t +b3Agingi,t ×Moderatingi,t
+
Σ9
k=4
bkcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t ,
(2)
where Moderatingi,t is the moderating variable, AI. And b0 is the constant
term, where bk (k = 1, …, 9) are the estimated coefficients. The
remaining variables are explained in line with Section 4.1.1.
4.1.3. Threshold regression model
To study the moderating role played by AI in the process of population
aging affecting food security, we refer to the approach of Lee et al.
(2022b). This study uses a classical threshold regression model
expressed as:
Foodi,t = c0 +c1Agingi,t *I

AIi,t < Q1
)
+c2Agingi,t*I
􀀀
AIi,t

)
+
Σ8
k=3
ckcontroli,t +ωi +γt +εi,t , (3)
where I() is a conditional function that is equal to 1 when the condition
in parentheses is satisfied and equal to 0 when it is not. AI is the
threshold variable, Q1 stands for the estimated threshold. And c0 is the
constant term, where ck (k = 1, …, 8) are the estimated coefficients. The
remaining variables are explained in line with Section 4.1.1.
4.1.4. DID model
To test the impact of the artificial intelligence policy, we adopt the
DID model, which is constructed as follows:
Foodi,t =d0 +d1didi,t +d2Agingi,t +d3Agingi,t ×didi,t +
Σ9
k=4
dkcontroli,t
+ωi +γt +εi,t,
(4)
where didi,t is the dummy variable, if a city i is taken into the treatment
group in year t, didi,t = 1, otherwise, didi,t = 0 (Hu et al., 2020; Zhu and
Lee, 2022). And d0 is the constant term, where dk (k = 1, …, 9) are the
estimated coefficients. The remaining variables are explained in line
with Section 4.1.1.
4.2. Variables and data
4.2.1. Dependent variable
Food security (Food) is gauged through the logarithm of food production
per capita. Food possession per capita is an essential gauge of
food security, and the amount of grain production per capita largely
influences the degree of food security. Therefore, based on previous
studies, our research uses total food production divided by total population
to measure the level of food security (Gilland, 2002; Zhang,
2011).
4.2.2. Independent variables
Mainly following the practice of the literature (Zeng et al., 2019),
this study measures the degree of aging using the elderly population
dependency ratio. However, since the main object of this paper is food
production in rural areas, we employ the rural aging rate to measure the
degree of rural population aging.
4.2.3. Moderating variables
Artificial intelligence is measured in this paper using the density of
industrial robots in the agricultural sector in each province. This paper
focuses on the evolution of AI for agriculture, and the current application
of AI in agriculture is mainly the input of industrial robots. Therefore,
this research mainly refers to the idea of (Acemoglu and Restrepo,
2020) and draws on the method of Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020),
based on the idea of the Bartik instrumental variable, to construct the
density of industrial robots in China’s agricultural sector so as to measure
AI’s application and development level in agriculture. The calculation
formula is:
AIi,j,t =
labori,j,t
labori,t
×
robotj,t
laborj,t
(5)
where AIi,j,t denotes the density of industrial robots at the agricultural
level in period t in region i, labori,j,t is the number of people employed in
agriculture in period t in region i, labori,t is the total number of workers
in all industries in period t in region i, and laborj,t is the total number of
agriculture workforce nationwide in period t. Data for industrial robots
are from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) report.
4.2.4. Control variables
This paper draws on previous studies and incorporates some necessary
control variables to enhance the credibility of the empirical results.
These include food price index, urbanization rate, government finance,
agricultural expenditure, technological progress and irrigation capacity.
(1) The food price index (Dp) reflects changes in food prices. Several
literatures have examined the impact of food price changes and found
that higher food prices incentivize more food production and that higher
food prices can stimulate agricultural supply in the short run and also
increase agricultural productivity in the long run (Nose and Yamauchi,
2016; Gozgor, 2019; Headey and Hirvonen, 2023). Therefore, this paper
includes food price as a control variable in the empirical study.
(2) Urbanization (URBAN), the increase of urbanization level will
lead to the loss of rural labor and agricultural land, thus affecting food

between agricultural production and urbanization and that the level of
urbanization has an important relationship with agricultural production
(Jiang et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023).
(3) As a degree of government intervention (Gov), government
expenditure plays an important role in socio-economic development and
influences agriculture development (Hussain et al., 2022; Nie and Lee,
2023). Governments can change taxes and expenditures through fiscal
policy to control aggregate demand, which will further affect employment,
national income, and all aspects of economic and social development
(Jiang et al., 2022; Tang and Sun, 2022). This paper quantifies
fiscal policy in terms of the government’s budgetary expenditure as a
share of GDP.
(4) The extent of government financial support for agriculture (Agr)
denotes government financial assistance to agriculture. A region’s
agricultural development requires government grants and price subsidies,
so the government’s financial strength will have an important
impact on regional agricultural production. This paper draws on Shen
et al. (2022) and Zhang et al. (2022) to include government financial
support for agriculture in the empirical study.
(5) Technological progress (Ti) reflects the level of scientific and
technological development of a region. Technological progress is an
important driver of economic development (Chen et al., 2020; Lin et al.,
2021; Lou et al., 2024). Chandio et al. (2021) find that technological
progress has a positive impact on food production. Shen et al. (2022)
also point out that the green growth of agriculture is largely driven by
technological progress, so technology has an important role in the process
of agricultural development. This paper uses patents to measure
technological progress based on the research of Lee et al. (2023).
(6) Irrigation capacity (Irrigation) reflects the ability and level of
agricultural irrigation in a region. Agricultural irrigation has an
important position in the production process of food crops, Lu et al.
(2019) proposed the constraints of water resource limitations on agricultural
production and agricultural planting structure and suggested
the relationship between irrigation water and irrigation, which discusses
the importance of agricultural irrigation for agricultural production. In
this paper, the effective irrigated area is used to measure the irrigation
capacity of a region. Many research studies show that irrigation capacity
has important impacts on agricultural production (Cao et al., 2015; Kang
et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2018).
This paper identifies the above variables as control variables based
on reality and other studies. Table A1 in the appendix presents the
detailed definition and information of each variable.
4.3. Sample data
This research collects data from provincial administrative regions in
China. Considering that the agricultural land systems in Hong Kong,
Macau, and Taiwan are different from those in the mainland, and due to
the absence of some data in Tibet, the empirical study excludes those
four. Overall, this study utilizes data from 30 provinces. Data for industrial
robots are from the IFR report, and the data required for other
variables are from the official website of the National Bureau of Statistics,
the China Rural Statistical Yearbook, the China Population and
Employment Statistical Yearbook, the Tertiary Industry Statistical
Yearbook, the China Statistical Yearbook, and provincial statistical
yearbooks. The years of data collected are from 2008 to 2020, and some
missing data are filled by linear interpolation.
Descriptive statistics are performed prior to the empirical analysis,
and Table 1 presents those of the primary variables. To prevent the
problem of multicollinearity, correlation tests are executed on the significant
variables. Table 2 reports the correlation coefficient matrix of
the main variables. The correlation coefficients between all the variables
are below 0.8. In addition, the variance inflation factors shown in
Table 3 are all <10. Thus, the model does not suffer from severe multicollinearity
problems. Table 4 reports the results of the panel unit root
test, showing that the variables used in this paper are stationary
sequences (Lee et al., 2022b,c).
5. Benchmark results
5.1. Benchmark regression
Table 5 lists the outcomes of the benchmark regression. First, we use
a two-way fixed effects model for regression estimation, which reflects
the underlying relationship between the variables. To verify the
robustness of the benchmark regression, this study adopts the method of
sequentially joining control variables and varying the type of fixed effects.
In the table, given increasing control variables, both province and
year effects are controlled for, and the coefficient of Aging is always
statistically significant in a positive direction. Changing the type of fixed
effects based on the addition of control variables also does not change
the underlying results. This implies that population aging does not
adversely alter food security, which is in line with the theoretical
analysis in Section 3.1. This also confirms the previous hypothesis 1.
5.2. Robust test
5.2.1. Iv-2SLS
Previous findings confirm that population aging does not adversely
affect food security, but this result may be biased due to endogeneity
issues. For instance, there are missing variables. Even though this paper
uses control variables and fixed effects, there are still some factors
affecting food production that are difficult to observe and control.
However, this paper does not give much consideration to reverse
causation, as food security is unlikely to drive regional trends in population
aging. Although demographic changes are inherently exogenous,
to better deal with endogeneity due to the model’s omission of variables,
inter-causality and measurement error, this section uses a two-stage
instrumental variables regression to re-estimate the effect of population
aging on food security.
Baochang et al. (2007) categorize 30 provinces into four levels based
on the intensity of family planning policies. This paper draws on Tan
et al. (2022) to create an ordered categorical variable. The higher the
value, the stricter the implementation of family planning policies. Since
this variable is a cross-sectional variable, our study employs panel data.
Therefore, we deal with the model’s endogeneity by constructing the
product term of the categorical variable of family planning policies and
the national elderly population dependency ratio in the following year
as the instrumental variable.
Instrumental variables have to satisfy both correlation and exogeneity
conditions. On the one hand, China implemented family planning
in the 1970s, a policy that changed the fertility rate at the time, which in
turn changed the demographic structure and ultimately affected the
extent of population aging. In short, the stricter the implementation of
family planning policies, the more the population ages. On the other
hand, family planning policies do not directly affect food production and
are well exogenous. Specifically, given that the study sample in this

paper is panel data, endogeneity cannot be handled using only family
planning policies due to the use of fixed effects. Therefore, this study
refers to Nunn and Qian (2014) and uses the interaction term between
the intensity of family planning policies and the national elderly population
dependency ratio in the following year as an instrumental variable.
Future national elderly population dependency ratios will not
affect food production in the current year. In sum, this paper chooses the
cross-multiplier term between the intensity of family planning policies
and the national elderly population dependency ratio in the following
year to deal with endogeneity.
Table 6 reports the relevant results of IV-2SLS estimation, in which
the unidentifiable test, the weak instrumental variable test, and the
over-identification test all pass. Column (1) presents the results of the
first-stage regressions, where the instrumental variables and rural population
aging positively and significantly correlated at the 1 % level.
This suggests that stricter implementation of family planning policies
leads to higher levels of population aging. Column (2) reports the outcomes
of the second-stage regression, where the regression coefficient is
significantly positive at the 1 % level, or in line with the results of the
benchmark regression. This suggests that the underlying conclusions
remain robust and convincing after dealing with endogeneity.
5.2.2. Alternate independent variables
To verify the robustness of the basic regression conclusion, this
section replaces the measurement of the core explanatory variable from
the rural old-age dependency ratio to the rural population aging rate.
The regression outcome in column (3) of Table 6 notes that the coefficient
of Old is significantly positive, or in line with the findings of the
benchmark regression. This indicates that the underlying conclusions
have a high degree of confidence.
5.2.3. Adding control variables
Many research studies show that industrial structure and degree of
openness also impact agricultural production (Matthews, 2014; Cao
et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2018; Fusco et al., 2020; Song
et al., 2021). Thus, to further mitigate the omitted variable problem, this
study adds two new variables, industrial structure and degree of openness,
to the original control variables. Industrial structure (IS) is
measured by the share of value added of the secondary and tertiary
sectors in GDP. The degree of openness (Open) is expressed as the percentage
of total foreign-invested imports and exports (converted at the
current year’s USD to RMB exchange rate) to GDP. Table 6 reports the
outcomes for adding control variables. The regression results in columns
(4) to (6) of the table show that IS has a negative effect while openness
has a significantly positive impact on ensuring food security, and that
the aging rate of the rural population remains significantly positive after

adding new variables. The results are in line with the basic conclusion.
5.2.4. Winsorizing the variables
For a more accurate reflection of the characteristics of most samples
and to avoid extreme values from influencing the outcomes, this
research winsorizes the variables at the 1 %, 2.5 %, and 7.5 % quantiles.
Table 6 lists the outcomes and we notice that the coefficients of Aging
are significantly positive, which proves the conclusion is robust.
6. The role of artificial intelligence
6.1. Moderating effect analysis
6.1.1. Full-sample regression
AI has become an important tool that can help deal with an aging
population (Wang et al., 2023). Today, AI is also starting to dominate
the agricultural sector (Ennouri et al., 2021; Shaikh et al., 2022). On the
one hand, an alternative role of AI is that it reduces the farming burden
and physical requirements of agricultural laborers (Acemoglu and
Restrepo, 2018a, 2018b). On the other hand, the efficient application of
AI can better utilize the advantages of older people with more farming
experience and agricultural labor inputs. In the context of an aging
population, the use of AI can effectively ensure food security. These
points are discussed in detail in Section 3.2.
On the basis of previous theoretical analysis, AI has a moderating
effect on population aging’s influence on food security. Exploring the
possible moderating mechanism of AI in the process of food security
affected by population aging, this paper adds the interaction term of AI
and Aging/Old to the original benchmark regression model. Centralization
is also performed to weaken the multicollinearity of the original

model. Full-sample regressions are initially conducted. Table 7 presents
the outcomes of the moderating effects without and with the addition of
control variables. The regression outcomes reveal that the coefficients of
the interaction terms are all significantly positive, indicating that AI
serves as a positive moderating factor in population aging’s impact on
food security. This is consistent with hypothesis 2.
6.1.2. Subsample regression
After the initial analysis of the moderating role of AI, to further
analyze the differences in the moderating role of AI in different regions,
this part continues the study by using a sub-sample regression method.
We divide the sample into two dimensions: economic geography subregion
and food production subregion.
Table 8 reports the results after subsample regression. First, from the
point of view of economic-geographical subdivisions, China can be
divided into three regions: east, central and west. Columns (1) to (3)
report the estimation results. Based on the results, it can be found that
the coefficients of the interaction terms are significantly positive in all
three regions, indicating that AI has a moderating effect in all three
regions. However, the moderating ability of AI varies across the three
regions. The magnitude of the moderating effect is ranked in descending
order of west, central and east. One of the possible reasons is that the
economy of the eastern region is developed, with a high level of urbanization
and industrialization, and the industrial structure is dominated
by the tertiary industry as well as new industries. The function of
agricultural production is mainly shifted to the central and western regions,
and the advanced manufacturing industry and the service industry
mainly drive the economic development of the eastern region.
Therefore, the resources invested in the field of agriculture are limited,
and the role of artificial intelligence development in promoting agricultural
production is also limited. Compared with the eastern region,
the central and western regions have the advantages of good agricultural
infrastructure, suitable natural conditions, sufficient arable land resources,
strong government policy support, more experienced agricultural
labor, and large-scale production mode. These conditions provide a
prerequisite and guarantee for the role of artificial intelligence. Therefore,
it is more conducive to the large-scale application of AI in agriculture
in the central and western regions, and it is better to play the role
of AI in agriculture.
In terms of food production subregions, columns (4) to (6) report the
estimation results, and the moderating role of AI plays a significant role
only in the main food marketing areas. Main grain production areas are
key grain production areas where geography, soil, climate, technology,
and other conditions are suitable for the cultivation of certain grain
crops and where they have certain comparative advantages such as
resource advantages, technological advantages, and economic benefits.
However, AI has not played its own advantages in these areas, indicating
that the development and application of AI are not coordinated with the
pattern of agricultural production. Although the agricultural infrastructure
of the main grain production areas is superior, they tend to
have lower economic levels, slower technological development, and
lower levels of AI application. Although the main grain marketing areas
have a weak agricultural base, the development level of artificial intelligence
is high and can be applied to agricultural production. Therefore,
the application of artificial intelligence, an emerging technology in
agriculture, has yet to be further promoted in the main food-producing
areas.
6.2. Threshold regression analysis
In this part, we explore the impact of population aging on food security
at different levels of AI. This is done by examining the relationships
among AI, population aging, and food security using AI as a
threshold variable.
Table 9 presents the outcome of the threshold selection after
applying the bootstrap approach. The p-values and their significant
levels are obtained by repeating the sampling 300 times to determine the
number of thresholds and threshold values. The results show that it
passes the single threshold test.
Table 10 reveals the results of the single-threshold regression with AI
as the threshold variable. They denote that the impact of population
aging on food security varies at different levels of AI development: the
coefficient of 0.937 is significant at the 10 % level when the level of AI
development is below the threshold (AI <0.2587); while the coefficient
of AI development level across the threshold (AI ≥0.2587) rises to 2.104
and is significant at the 1 % level. This suggests that the impact of
population aging on food security is better at higher levels of AI application.
The empirical results are consistent with previous findings,
whereby artificial intelligence empowers the older rural workforce to
improve its role in food security.

analyze the role of AI in the impact of population aging on food security.
In 2015, The State Council in China issued the “Guiding Opinions on
Actively Promoting Internet Actions”, which listed the Internet and
artificial intelligence as key actions. At that time, 12 provinces,
including Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui,
Guizhou, Jiangxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jilin and Heilongjiang, responded
to the call and issued local policies related to artificial intelligence. Thus,
the above provinces are taken into a treatment group and other cities are
taken into the control group. Based on the DID model, we construct a
quasi-natural experiment, and the relevant results are shown in columns
(1) and (2) of Table 11. The result in column (1) shows that the coefficient
of did is significantly positive, indicating that the artificial intelligence
policy benefits food security. The result in column (2) shows that
the coefficient of Aging*did is significantly positive, indicating that the
AI policy plays a positive role in the impact of population aging on food
security.
Passing the parallel trend test is a prerequisite for using the DID
model. Thus, taking the fourth year before policy implementation as a
base period, we conducted a parallel trend test, and the relevant results
are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that there is no significant difference
between the experimental group and the control group before the
implementation of the policy, indicating that the parallel trend test
passes. To further demonstrate that this policy is not accidental, we
conduct a placebo test. The result is presented in Fig. 3. Construct 1000
times a virtual experimental group and control group randomly and
capture t-value of each time to form the nuclear density distribution
map. The distribution is normal and the t-value is concentrated at 0,
indicating that the policy effect of this artificial intelligence is not

Due to the influence of sample selection, the results of DID may be
biased. Therefore, we reassessed the impact of this policy in conjunction
with PSM. Three main matching methods, including PSM-Neighboring,
PSM-Kernel, and Entropy Balancing, are used in this part. The results of
PSM-DID are shown in column (3) to (8) of Table 11. We can find that
the results of PSM-DID model are consistent with the results of DID
model, showing that our findings are robust.
6.4. Policy implications
Based on the research findings, this paper makes policy recommendations
in terms of both the rural older labor force and AI development.
For the rural labor force of the elderly population. First, the Government
should respond to the trend of aging by vigorously developing
the rural pension service industry, including pension, medical care and
insurance, to improve further the social security system and life productivity
of the rural elderly population and to unleash the productive
potential of the elderly population. Second, the Government can
encourage rural laborers to take the initiative to participate in online
and offline vocational skills training, guide agricultural workers to acquire
new knowledge and skills to adapt to changing agricultural production
conditions, and help to build a large contingent of knowledgeand
skill-based agricultural workers to effectively meet agricultural
production needs.
For the development of artificial intelligence. First, the government

should increase investment in infrastructure, improve network, software,
and storage to provide support for AI applications. These infrastructure
improvements can include the construction of high-speed
Internet, the promotion of cloud computing technology, the development
of big data platforms. Second, the government can strengthen the
training of AI-related talents, train more AI researchers and users, and
provide more human support for the development of artificial intelligence.
Third, the government needs to formulate and improve artificial
intelligence policies and regulations to promote the development and
application of artificial intelligence. These policies and regulations can
include financial support for research and development, tax incentives,
and market access rules to stimulate enterprises to increase investment
in AI.
7. Conclusion
7.1. Main conclusions
With the increasing prominence of aging populations worldwide,
food security is gaining greater attention. At the same time, the rapid
development of AI provides new solutions to address the labor gap due
to an aging population. Most of the existing literature has studied the
ability of AI to cope with the adverse impacts of population aging in
terms of economic growth and industrial structure. Yet, scant research
has considered the application and effects of AI in the field of agricultural
production. Therefore, this paper selects data from a sample of 30
provinces in China to analyze the impact of population aging on food
security and the role of artificial intelligence. Based on detailed theoretical
analysis and empirical tests, the conclusions obtained are as
follows.
First, modern agricultural production techniques and organization
have greatly reduced the constraints of individual physical strength and
human capital on agricultural production. Population aging in rural
areas has not negatively impacted food security. Therefore, there is no
need to be too pessimistic about the inevitable aging of the rural population.
Second, AI has a positive effect on the impact of population
aging on food security, and so the application of AI is beneficial to food
security. Third, the moderating effect of AI is heterogeneous. Compared
with other provinces, AI can play a strongly positive moderating effect in
central and west regions and major grain-selling areas.
7.2. Limitations and prospects
In this part, we propose some possible research prospects based on
the limitations of the article. First, the data can be more refined. Our
article uses provincial-level data to analyze topics of “impact of population
aging on food security in the context of artificial intelligence”. If
city-level data is used, the heterogeneity of this impact can be described
in more detail. Thus, future research could look at collecting city-level
data on food security, which is currently difficult to collect and needs
to be mined in government reports or other documents. Second, the
spatial spillover effect can be explored. This paper considers the impact
in an individual region and ignores possible spatial spillover effects.
Therefore, the follow-up research can adopt the method of spatial
econometrics to study this topic further.
