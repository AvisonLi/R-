Abstract
This study explored the relationship between population aging and economic
growth in 74 developing countries between 1990 and 2019, highlighting the vital
role of older workers (as measured by labor force participation of older people) in
the national economy. A static panel estimator was used to examine the relationship
between population aging, labor force participation of older people and economic
growth. Results showed a negative association between population aging
and economic growth, but the inverse relationship was mitigated by the labor force
participation of older people. This indicates that the marginal impact of population
aging on economic growth depends on the labor force participation of older people.
The mitigating role of labor force participation of older people remained robust in a
series of robustness checks. This study provides some policy recommendations to
raise the labor force participation of older people to reduce the negative impact of
population aging on economic growth. Effective utilization of human resources of
older people is essential to bring about sustainable economic development.

1 Introduction
What is the role of older workers (as measured by labor force participation of older
people) in the population aging–economic growth nexus in developing countries?
This question arises when the older population in these countries increases rapidly
at the turn of the 21st century, while the labor force participation rate of older people
remains low. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) database,
the labor force participation rate of the population aged 65 and above in developing
countries has declined from the average level of 34.4% in 1990 to 30.6% in
2019. This is a distressing figure as the older people aged 65 years and above made
up about 8% of the total population in the less developed regions (excluding least
developed countries) in 2020, and it is projected to increase to over 16% by 2050
(United Nations 2019a).
Population aging has become an issue of great concern in many parts of the
world (Bloom and Luca 2016; Qadri et al. 2013; United Nations 2019b). Challenges
such as adequacy of social security, old age pension, rising non-communicable diseases,
providing adequate healthcare services, and labor shortage will inevitably be
straining the economy and public resources of developing countries in the coming
decades. Several studies concluded that population aging slowed down economic
growth (Aigner-Walder and Döring 2012; Bloom et al. 2010; Hondroyiannis and
Papapetrou 2001; Hsu 2017; Lisenkova et al. 2013; Otsu and Shibayama 2016).
However, the growing ‘gray market’ can be viewed as an optimistic economic outlook
if more and more older people remain active in the labor force. Bloom et al.
(2010) proposed various policy reforms to tackle the economic consequences of
population aging, such as raising the legal retirement age. The extension of the
retirement age would facilitate more older persons to work and remain active in the
labor market, and this, in turn, would increase the proportion of the working population
and subsequently contribute to the national output, thereby offsetting the negative
impact of population aging on economic growth.
The mitigating effect of labor force participation of older people in the aging–economic
growth association model postulated by Bloom et al. (2010) has been widely
applied in developed countries. For instance, the model was found to be viable
in France, Germany and Italy, where the negative impact of population aging on
growth was reduced by the increasing share of older persons in the labor market due
to a rise in the legal retirement age (Vogel et al. 2017). Nevertheless, this might not
be the case in developing countries, as the degree of ageism toward older persons
was found to be more prevalent than that in developed countries (Nash et al. 2018).
The presence of ageism in the labor market might impede the economic contribution
of older people if they are assigned trivial tasks with lower productivity and income.
This implies that the labor force participation of older people under the ageism setting
in developing countries is inconclusive in mitigating the negative consequences
of population aging on economic growth. Hence, the applicability of the model by
Bloom et al. (2010) in developing countries remains contentious. The present study
fills in the research gap by quantifying the role of labor force participation of older
people in the aging–growth nexus in developing countries.

In general, developing countries have a lower capacity and credit constrained in
addressing the economic consequences imposed by population aging than developed
countries. Most advanced economies have access to the international financial market
for their currencies and allow them to borrow internationally using their national
currencies, but this is often not the case for most developing countries. The presence
of credit constraints, coupled with the rapid population aging, would result in insufficient
resources to overcome the negative influence of population aging on economic
growth. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the mitigating role of the labor force
participation of older people in overcoming the economic consequences caused by
population aging, especially in the developing countries with limited resources and
economically unprepared to embrace the increasing proportion of older people.
This study aims to investigate the role of labor force participation of older people
in mitigating the negative impact of population aging on economic growth, motivated
by the dearth of research on this issue and the importance of the findings in
preserving the sustainable growth of developing countries. Because the older populations
are increasing rapidly in the developing countries, early preparation for an
aging society is crucial for these countries to have sustainable economic development,
and to cater to the needs of the fast-rising number of older people.
The current study adopts the mitigating effect of labor force participation of older
people in the aging–economic growth association model postulated by Bloom et al.
(2010). A preview of the empirical results shows that population aging is inversely
related to the per capita growth rate, and labor force participation of older persons is
essential in mitigating the negative relationship. Population aging has a significant
adverse effect on economic growth if the labor force participation of older people is
at a low level. However, the negative effect becomes less apparent and turns into a
positive effect as the labor force participation of older people increases. The results
remain robust in a series of robustness checks.
This study contributes to the existing literature from three aspects. Firstly, the
present analysis validates the role of labor force participation of older people in the
aging–growth nexus in developing countries. A similar study has been conducted in
developed countries (see Vogel et al. 2017), but there is a dearth of research focusing
on developing countries. Secondly, this paper puts forth the alternative model
specification by providing the marginal effect of population aging on growth at
various levels of labor force participation of older people, which complements and
expands the previous study performed by Vogel et al. (2017). Thirdly, although the
aging–growth association was well established (see Maity and Sinha 2020, Mamun
et al. 2020, Pan and Chang 2019, Pham and Vo 2021, and Saccone 2017), the recommendation
to overcome the negative consequences of population aging is often
neglected in past literature. Hence, the present study identifies the potential factor
that is useful in overcoming the growth-deteriorating effect of population aging.
Population aging is inevitable, and thus, it is time to ascertain the ways to overcome
the negative impact of population aging on economic growth in developing
countries.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical review on
the mitigating role of labor force participation of older people in the aging–growth
nexus. Section 3 describes the data, empirical model, and methodology of this study.

Section 4 presents the baseline estimation results, followed by the robustness checks
in Sect. 5. Section 6 sets forth policy implications and recommendations, followed
by the limitations of the study in Sect. 7, and Sect. 8 concludes the paper.
2 Theoretical review
The mitigating effect of older persons’ labor force participation in the aging–growth
nexus was first proposed by Bloom et al (2010) in a well-cited policy brief paper.
The authors presumed that an increase in the legal retirement age would induce
older persons to remain active in the labor market, thereby offsetting the adverse
impact of population aging on economic growth. However, the study did not outline
the theoretical justifications on how older persons’ labor force participation can
mitigate the economic implications of population aging.
A recent study by Vogel et al (2017) suggested two possible channels in justifying
the mitigating effect. Firstly, the labor force channel reveals that an increase in the
retirement age would induce older persons to work longer and remain active in the
labor market. This in turn would increase the working population and per capita output,
thereby mitigating the adverse impact of population aging on economic growth.
The working population is the primary contributor to the production of output in
the economy. Hence, the increasing number of older persons who remain active in
the labor market would increase the share of the working population and reduce the
proportion of dependents in the economy. Taken together, more labor is involved in
the production and a lower proportion of the population is consuming the national
resources, thereby offsetting the economic consequences of population aging.
Secondly, the human capital channel explains that an increase in the retirement
age would extend the work-life planning horizon of households, thereby amplifying
the incentives to invest in human capital accumulation. In general, older people
who remain active in the labor market would receive a steady income stream, which
can be used to invest in the child’s education within the household. Greater human
capital accumulation would result in higher per capita output, thereby mitigating the
adverse impact of population aging on economic growth.
3 Methods
3.1 Data
This study utilized unbalanced panel data of 74 developing countries listed in
Table 1. Country development status was based on the classification by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) (IMF 2019). The annual data were taken from
the World Development Indicators (WDI) and the ILO database for 1990–2019.
1879

Economic Change and Restructuring (2022) 55:1875–1912
Notably, these two databases are the major data sources for aging studies and have
been widely used in the empirical studies examining the impact of population aging
on economic growth (Bloom et al. 2010; Maity and Sinha 2020; Pan and Chang
2019; Saccone 2017; Teixeira et al. 2016). The sampled countries and periods
selected were based on data available on the labor force participation rate of the
population aged 65 and above. The study period was averaged into 5-year intervals,1
with a maximum of six observations for each country: between 1990 and 1994, 1995
and 1999, 2000 and 2004, 2005 and 2009, 2010 and 2014, 2015 and 2019. The averaging
procedure filtered out the effect of business cycle fluctuations and therefore
improves the accuracy of the estimations. Table 2 shows the list of variables used in
this study.
3.2 Empirical model
According to the United Nations (2002) and the World Health Organization (2011),
the proportion of the population aged 65 and above is one of the conventional indicators
used to measure the pace of population aging. This study employs the United
Nations’ (2019b) definition, in which older persons refer to those aged 65 years or
over. Hence, this study defines the ‘older workers’ as individuals aged 65 and above
that remain in the labor force. The empirical model used to examine the relationship
between population aging and economic growth is shown as Eq. (1).
where i is the country index, t is the time index, RGDPC is the growth rate of real
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, POPAGE65 is the proportion of the population
aged 65 and above, LFPR65 is the labor force participation rate of the population
aged 65 and above, X is a vector of control variables (which include gross
capital formation, population growth rate, trade openness, secondary school enrolment
ratio, and the ratio of domestic credit to private sector). These control variables

were widely used in the economic growth literature (Intisar et al. 2020; Khan et al.
2019; Law et al. 2013, 2018; Law and Singh 2014; Topcu et al. 2020), by taking into
consideration the impacts of investment, demographic changes, international trade,
human capital, and financial development on economic growth, respectively. The vi
represents the unobserved country-specific effect term, and εit is the error term.
All the independent variables tend to be endogenous, and therefore, each of these
variables is replaced with its own lagged 1-year value to address the endogeneity issue
(due to the reverse causality between dependent and independent variables). Notably,
the utilization of lagged one-period value has been commonly practiced across a wide
variety of disciplines in economics and finance to mitigate the endogeneity issue in the
model (Chia et al. 2020; Ibrahim 2019a, 2019b; Ibrahim and Law 2019; Ibrahim et al.
2019).
The coefficient β1 in Eq. (1) measures the effect of population aging on economic
growth. The influence of population aging on economic growth was conditional upon
the labor force participation of older people. Bloom et al. (2010) proposed that the
increase in retirement age is necessary in overcoming the shrinking labor force and
mitigating the negative economic consequences of population aging. Since this study
investigates the role of older workers in the nexus between economic growth and population
aging, Eq. (1) is therefore extended to incorporate the interaction between the
aging population and labor force participation of older persons, as in Eq. (2). The inclusion
of the interaction term enables identifying the impact of population aging on economic
growth at the varying degree of older persons’ participation in the labor force.
The marginal effect of population aging on economic growth depends on β3 after
adding the interaction term, as in Eq. (3). That is,
Static panel estimators, namely the pooled ordinary least square (POLS), fixed effect
model (FEM), and random effect model (REM) were used to estimate Eqs. (1) and (2).
Stata version 14 was used to perform all data analysis. Robust standard error was computed
to preclude heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the error term. Additional
control variables such as inflation rate, population density, unemployment rate, percent
living in urban areas, and the net inflow of foreign direct investment were included in
the robustness check to avoid omitted variable bias in the model. The inclusion of these
variables is guided by the economic growth literature (Azman-Saini et al. 2010; Diebolt
and Hippe 2019; Ibrahim 2007; Okun 1963; Topcu et al. 2020). Alternative measures
for aging population, namely the old-age dependency ratio and aging index, were
included in the model to avoid the measurement error. In addition, the aggregate labor
force participation rate of older people was substituted with the gender-specific labor
force participation rate of older persons to identify the roles of older female and male
workers in mitigating the negative consequences of population aging. All the variables
used in the robustness check are shown in Table 2.

4 Baseline results
4.1 Descriptive statistics
Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the study variables. The average growth
of real GDP per capita in the developing countries in this study was 2.1%, over
the study period. The proportion of the population aged 65 and above, on average,
was 5.5%, while the old-age dependency ratio was 8.9%. The labor force participation
rate of the older persons was estimated at 33.1%. The labor force participation
rate of older females was found to be lower than their male counterparts (24.2% vs.
43.8%).
Table 4 shows the correlation matrix of the variables used in the analysis. The
proportion of the population aged 65 and above (POPAGE65), the old-age dependency
ratio (DEPENDENCY), and the aging index (AI65) were highly correlated.
Hence, the old-age dependency ratio and aging index were excluded from the baseline
model and were only used for robustness checks. Similar conclusion applied
to the gender-specific labor force participation rate of older persons, whereby older
female (LFPR65FEMALE) and male (LFPR65MALE) labor force participation
rates were found to be highly correlated with the aggregate labor force participation
rate of older persons (LFPR65). Meanwhile, the correlations for all other explanatory
variables were less than 0.8 (a threshold value established by Gujarati 2003),
indicating multicollinearity is not a major issue in the model.

4.2 Baseline panel regression results
Table 5 shows the baseline results for panel regression. Columns 1 to 4 show the
estimation results for the model without interaction term (Eq. 1). Based on the
three model selection tests, the REM produces the appropriate estimator for making
inferences on the impact of an aging population on economic growth. The robust
standard error is used to estimate the REM to account for heteroscedasticity and
autocorrelation in the error term. The REM with a robust standard error shows that
population aging (POPAGE65) has a significant adverse effect on the per capita
growth rate (column 4). This indicates that population aging will have a negative
effect on the country’s economic growth. The finding of this study is consistent with
past research (Aigner-Walder and Döring 2012; Bloom et al. 2010; Hondroyiannis
and Papapetrou 2001; Hsu 2017; Katagiri 2018; Lisenkova et al. 2013; Oliver 2015;
Otsu and Shibayama 2016; Park and Shin 2011).
Columns 5 to 8 provide the panel regression results for the model with interaction
terms (Eq. 2). Based on the model selection tests, the REM was selected to examine
the interaction effect between the aging population and labor force participation of
older persons on economic growth. The robust standard error used for estimating
the REM is shown in column 8. Brambor et al. (2006) argued that it is inappropriate
to interpret the coefficients of old age population (POPAGE65) and older persons’
labor force participation rate (LFPR65) if the model contains an interaction term,
as the former captures the effect of population aging on economic growth only if
the older persons’ labor force participation rate is equal to zero. The latter provides
the effect of older persons’ labor force participation rate on economic growth only if
population aging is equal to zero. Thus, the coefficients of POPAGE65 and LFPR65
are meaningless with the inclusion of interaction term in the model. The interaction
term (POPAGE65 × LFPR65) is positive and significant at the 1% level (column 8),
and this indicates the significant effect of labor force participation of older people in
mitigating the negative effect of population aging on economic growth.
As suggested by Brambor et al. (2006), the marginal effect of population aging
on economic growth was computed at different levels of labor force participation of

older people to exhibit its mitigating effect. The role of older workers in mitigating
the negative effect of population aging on economic growth is shown in the marginal
effect diagram (Fig. 1). Population aging has a significant and negative effect on economic
growth if the older persons’ labor force participation rate is at the minimum
level (1.514%). The negative effect corresponded to the intercept of the solid marginal
effect line (− 0.221%). However, the negative impact of population aging on economic
growth diminishes and becomes positive with the rising labor force participation of
older persons.
This study demonstrates the fundamental role of labor force participation of older
people in mitigating the inverse relationship between population aging and economic
growth, and this corroborates the hypothesis posited by Bloom et al. (2010) and the
empirical findings by Vogel et al. (2017). The effect of population aging on economic
growth was found to be conditional upon varying degrees of older persons’ labor force
participation. This study shows that a higher rate of labor force participation of older
people is important to grapple with the consequences of population aging.

5 Robustness checks
This study aimed to examine the role of older workers in explaining the
aging–economic growth nexus. Hence, a series of robustness checks were conducted
to ensure the reliability of statistical inferences drawn from the model
with an interaction term (Eq. 2).
5.1 Additional control variables
The first robustness check considered additional growth-related variables in the
model to avoid omitted variable bias. These additional variables include the
inflation rate (INFLATION), natural log of population density (lnDENSITY),
unemployment rate (UNE), urbanization (URBAN), and the net inflow of foreign
direct investment (FDI). Table 6 shows that the coefficients for the interaction
term (POPAGE65 × LFPR65) are positive and significant for all the equations. As
indicated earlier, inferences will be made based on the marginal effect estimate
instead of the coefficient of the interaction term. Nevertheless, the marginal effect
diagram will not be plotted for all the equations due to space constraints but is
available upon request. Meanwhile, the marginal effect of population aging on
economic growth was computed for the minimum, mean, and maximum values of
the older persons’ labor force participation rate. A similar approach was adopted
for the subsequent robustness analysis.
The aging population has a negative and significant effect on economic growth
if the level of older persons’ participation in the labor force is low (Table 6).
However, the negative effect becomes less apparent and turns into positive with
increasing labor force participation of older people. This outcome is consistent
with the above baseline results. This reaffirms that the mitigating role of older
workers is not influenced by the inclusion of additional variables in the model.
5.2 Controlling for the outliers effect
Outliers significantly affect the accuracy of estimation and lead to biased results.
Hence, the second robustness check is performed to control the outliers in the
data using winsorization and cook distance test. For winsorization, all dependent
and independent variables in Eqs. (1) and (2) were winsorized at the: (i) 1st and
99th percentiles, and (ii) 5th and 95th percentiles. Table 7 shows the estimation
results. Based on the marginal effect estimates, economic growth was negatively
influenced by population aging when the labor force participation rate of older
persons is low. However, the relationship was mitigated by the higher labor force
participation of older people. Thus, the mitigating effect of older workers remains
robust and not affected by outliers.

5.3 Alternative measures of population aging
The old-age dependency ratio and aging index have been widely used as proxies of
population aging in economic-related research in the past (Li and Zhang 2015; Lo
and Sek 2016; Oliver 2015). The proportion of the population aged 65 years and
above is replaced with the old-age dependency ratio and aging index for the third
robustness check. The marginal effect estimate in Table 8 shows that both the oldage
dependency ratio and aging index have a negative and significant effect on economic
growth if the level of older persons’ participation in the labor force is low.
However, the negative effect turns into positive with a higher labor force participation
of the older people. Hence, the mitigating effect of labor force participation rate
of older persons remains robust and is not affected by different measures of population
aging.
5.4 Gender‑specific labor force participation of older persons
Analyses in Sect. 5.1 to Sect. 5.3 employed the aggregate labor force participation
rate of older persons (LFPR65) in examining the mitigating effect of older workers.
This may result in aggregation bias, given that older female and male workers
might have different contributions toward the relationship between population aging
and economic growth. In particular, older female labor force participation may be
less likely to mitigate the negative impact of population aging on growth, due to
the labor law that restricted the types of jobs women can undertake, and when and
where they are permitted to work. According to World Bank (2018), the labor law
in 104 out of the 189 economies barred women from working at night or in certain
jobs in manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture, water, and transportation
sectors, and most of these economies were developing countries.2 Consequently,
this prevented women from joining the labor market and reduced their labor force
participation rate. This argument was well supported by the descriptive analysis in
Table 3, whereby older female labor force participation rate was nearly half of that
of their male counterparts. The findings on the mitigating effect of aggregate labor
force participation rate of older persons may not be generalized to older female labor
force participation. Hence, the baseline Eq. (2) is re-estimated by substituting the
aggregate labor force participation rate of older persons (LFPR65) with the older
female (LFPR65FEMALE) and male (LFPR65MALE) labor force participation
rates.

Tables 9 and 10 present the estimation results based on older female and male
labor force participation, respectively. Contrary to the general perception that older
female workers have a less significant contribution to the national output, the results
show that older female workers were important in overcoming the negative impact
of population aging on growth in developing countries. The marginal effect shows
that both older female and male labor force participation was significant in mitigating
the negative impact of population aging on economic growth. The aging population
poses a negative impact on economic growth when the older female and
male participation in the labor force is at a low level. However, this analysis shows
that the negative impact was mitigated by the increasing labor force participation
of older females and males. The result indicates that older female and male labor
force participation are equally important in addressing the economic consequences
of population aging. Hence, the result reaffirms the baseline finding based on the
aggregate labor force participation rate of older persons. The mitigating effect of
the labor force participation rate of older persons remains robust and does not suffer
from aggregation bias.
5.5 Alternative sample period
The robustness check in this section is based on the alternative sample period. The
baseline result for the model with an interaction term (Eq. 2) is estimated using the
5-year average data. Alternatively, the sample period can be averaged into 6-year
intervals, with a maximum of five observations for each country: between 1990 and
1995, 1996 and 2001, 2002 and 2007, 2008 and 2013, 2014 and 2019, and the result
is shown in Table 11. The result is similar to the baseline finding, in which the coefficients
for the interaction term remain positive and significant for all the equations.
The marginal effect shows that population aging reduces economic growth, but the
effect is mitigated by the higher labor force participation rate of older persons.

5.6 Developing countries with different aging status
The robustness check in this section examines countries with different aging status.
The United Nations and the World Health Organization consider society as
‘aging’ when 7% of the total population is aged 65 years and above. The urgency of
overcoming the impact of population aging on economic growth is felt much more
in countries with a large percentage of older persons (7% and above), such as in
China, Thailand, and Vietnam. In contrast, the problems of population aging are less
pressing in most countries in the African continent given the relatively large base
of young people. Hence, the sampled developing countries are further classified
according to the percentage of older persons. The country classification is shown in
Appendix 1. To examine the mitigating effect of older persons’ labor force participation
in these two groups of countries, the baseline Eq. (2) is extended by incorporating
a new dummy variable of AGING and its interaction terms with the proportion
of the population aged 65 and above (POPAGE65), labor force participation rate
of older persons (LFPR65) and the interaction between POPAGE65 and LFPR65
(POPAGE65 × LFPR65), as written below:
The AGING dummy variable takes the value of 1 for countries with at least 7%
of older persons and 0 otherwise.3 Table 12 shows the REM estimation results for
countries with less than 7% of older persons and countries with at least 7% of older
persons. The marginal effect estimate indicates that when the labor force participation
rate of older persons is at a low level, an increase in the older population would
negatively influence economic performance, but the negative impact is mitigated by
rising labor force participation of older people, regardless of the status of population
aging. The results suggest that the baseline finding on the role of older persons’
labor force participation in mitigating the negative effect of population aging
on economic growth remains robust and is not affected by the country’s aging status.
5.7 Alternative estimation method
Economic growth is widely perceived to be dynamic in nature, and the current rate
of growth is dependent on the past growth rate. Hence, empirical analysis related to
economic growth tends to employ a dynamic model by including the initial income
of GDP per capita as the explanatory variable to control for the dynamic effect and
avoid model misspecification error (Azman-Saini et al. 2010; Law et al. 2018; Law
and Singh 2014). In this regard, the static panel estimator used in the earlier analysis
may produce biased estimates due to the omission of the initial income variable in
the model. Thus, to account for the dynamic effect of economic growth, the baseline
Eq. (2) is extended as below:

The ln represents the natural logarithm. INITIAL refers to the initial income for
GDP per capita. Initial income is based on the initial year of each averaged time
period. For instance, if the 5-year sample period runs from 1990 to 1994, then the
initial income is the GDP per capita for 1990.
However, the static panel estimator may suffer from Nickell’s (1981) bias with
the inclusion of initial income variable, and produce biased estimates. This issue can
be solved by employing the dynamic panel system generalized method of moments
(system GMM) estimator proposed by Blundell and Bond (1998) to estimate Eq. (5).
This technique was commonly used in the growth literature (Azman-Saini et al.
2010; Law et al. 2018). The estimation was conducted based on the xtabond2 routine
proposed by Roodman (2009a).
Apart from addressing Nickell’s bias, the GMM estimator is an instrumental
variable estimator that utilizes the internal instrument in mitigating the endogeneity
issue that arises from the reverse causality between economic growth and aging
population. As indicated by Nagarajan et al. (2021), the economic growth of a country
will alter the social structure of households and lead to fertility decline. This in
turn would lead to accelerated population aging. Thus, the GMM estimator can be
used to address the endogeneity problem and provides a robustness check on the
baseline result.
In the empirical estimation, this study encompasses Ibrahim’s (2019b) recommendation
by replacing all the independent variables with its own lagged 1-year
value to address the instrument proliferation problem in GMM estimator. Moreover,
the system GMM estimator consists of two variants: the one-step and two-step estimators.
The one-step estimator provides an efficient estimate in the presence of a
small cross-section unit. The two-step estimator is asymptotically more efficient than
the one-step estimator because it uses optimal weighting matrices (Azman-Saini
et al. 2010). However, its application to a sample with a small cross-section dimension
may lead to biased standard errors. Hence, this study applied Windmeijer’s

finite sample correction to address the severe downward bias in the standard errors
of the two-step system GMM estimates (Windmeijer 2005). Both estimators are
used in estimating Eq. (5) to ensure robustness.
This study follows Roodman’s (2009a) suggestion in using the forward orthogonal
deviations to remove the individual-specific effect. This method is more efficient
than the first-difference transformation as it minimizes data loss in the unbalanced
panel. Furthermore, all the regressors are likely to be endogenous, and the standard
treatment is to instrumentalize these variables with lag two and longer in the firstdifference
equation and lag one of the first-difference in the level equation (Roodman
2009a). However, this would result in an instrument proliferation problem, due
to the small number of countries in this study. Hence, not all the available lags will
be used as an instrument. Instead, the independent variables will be instrumentalized
with lag two in the first-difference equation and lag one of the first-difference in
the level equation,4 as suggested by Roodman (2009b).
The consistency of GMM estimator depends on two specification tests, namely
the Hansen J test of too many instruments and the autocorrelation test in the disturbances
(Arellano and Bond 1991). Failure to reject the null hypothesis for the
Hansen J test indicates no instrument proliferation. For the autocorrelation test, one
should not reject the absence of the second-order autocorrelation (AR(2)).
Table 13 shows the estimation result of the system GMM estimator. The lagged
one of initial income (INITIAL) is insignificant for all the equations, indicating the
absence of dynamic effect in the model. This reinforces the utilization of a static
panel estimator in the earlier analysis. Notably, the role of older workers in mitigating
the negative influence of population aging on economic growth is significant and
consistent throughout, thereby reaffirming that the baseline result is robust to the
endogeneity of aging population. The marginal effect estimate shows that population
aging impeded economic growth when the labor force participation rate of older
persons is low. However, the negative effect of population aging turns positive at a
higher level of labor force participation rate of older people.
Post estimation diagnostic tests suggested that the estimation results of one- and
two-step system GMM are valid. As such, failure to reject the Hansen J test indicated
the validity of instruments used in the estimator. Similarly, failure to reject
the null hypothesis of Arellano-Bond statistic for error autocorrelation indicated the
absence of error correlation. In addition, the number of instruments was less than
the number of cross-section countries, indicating the absence of instrument proliferation
problem.
6 Policy implications and recommendations
This study analyzes the aging–economic growth nexus using panel data from 74
developing countries between 1990 and 2019. Specifically, this study explores the
potential influence of older workers in mitigating the relationship between population
aging and economic growth. This study draws attention to the importance of

promoting the participation of older people in countering the adverse effect of population
aging on economic growth, as the developing countries will be aging rapidly
in the coming decades. It is prudent for developing countries to tap the vast pool
of the resources of older people for sustainable economic development. Rising life
expectancy is a demographic trend worldwide, which has led to rapid population
aging and affected the accumulation of productive factors (He and Li 2020). Keeping
equitable economic development in a rapidly aging nation requires proper labor
market policy planning. Developing countries can follow the policies and strategies
of the European nations to abolish the retirement age, to allow older persons to work
beyond the current retirement age. Raising the labor force participation of older people
is crucial for sustained economic growth to grapple with the consequences of
population aging.
Besides, the government and employers can provide better incentives such as
flexible workspace and working hours, as well as tax rebates for both older employees
and their employers to encourage and facilitate the labor force participation of
older people. However, it is important to note that the economic impacts of population
aging are likely to vary across countries (Bloom et al. 2010). As such, the
active aging programs need to be designed with care and country-specific. For
instance, developing countries with a high proportion of older people, such as China
and Vietnam have taken various measures to establish a comprehensive aging policy
system. In China, some of the policy measures include the establishment of the
National Working Commission on Aging Issues (1983), the 7-Year Programme on
Aging (1994), the Law on Protection of Rights and Interests of Older Persons (1996,
revised in 2013), the Decision to Strengthen the Work on Aging (2001), 10th 5-Year
Plan on Development of Undertakings on aging (2001), and the 13th 5-Year Plan for
Development of Undertakings on Aging and Old Age Support System (2017) (Zhu
et al. 2019). Vietnam’s policy measures on aging include the Ordinance on Elderly
People (2000), Law on the Elderly 2009 (2010), and the National Action Program
on Older Persons 2012–2020 (2012) (Vietnam National Committee on Ageing and
UNFPA 2019). Some developing countries in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand
and Malaysia have considered a corporate income tax deduction and incentives for
employing senior citizens (Ministry of Finance Malaysia 2018; Teerawichitchainan
et al. 2019). Other developing countries can thus draw on these countries’ experiences
in designing a pragmatic policy and programs for older persons.
Good health is essential to prolong the working life of older people. Health is a
major impediment to the labor force participation of older people (Schofield et al.
2017). Therefore, the national governments must strengthen the healthcare system
to equip the workers better to meet the challenges of a rapidly rising old age population.
Modern technology could be beneficial to older employees if they are given
lifelong training and re-training. New technologies can make job-related tasks more
age-friendly (Asian Development Bank 2018), and this facilitates the older workers
to remain in and re-enter the labor market. The innovative agri-business to engage
the older workers using the Internet and information systems in a town in Japan

(Hashimoto 2012) can serve as a model for future technology-based employment
among the older workers.
Whilst ageism affects both sexes, gendered ageism has become increasingly common,
and women are often subjected to greater discrimination in the labor market
(Button 2020). Because of the significant role of older female labor force participation
in mitigating the inverse relationship between population aging and economic
growth, older females should not be left out from the labor market. The policymakers
should strive to retain this group of the population, as well as the older males in
the labor market. Campaigns and programs targeted to eliminate age discrimination
at the workplace can go a long way to optimize the human resources of the older
workers, as they possess a high level of expertise, skills, experience, and knowledge.
The World Health Organization has developed a global campaign to combat ageism
since 2016 (Officer and Fuente-Núñez 2018), and this should be expanded to various
job sectors with the local government’s assistance. The framework established
by the European Union in 2000 on equal treatment in employment and inclusion of
laws against ageism in the workplace (United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe 2019) can serve as a basis for employment-related policy planning in developing
countries.
All these recommendations are conditional upon the willingness and capability of
the older people to remain economically active beyond the retirement age. Nevertheless,
as population aging is inevitable, there is a need for adequate preparation by all
stakeholders before the world turns old.
7 Limitations
This study focused on the role of older workers in mitigating the negative relationship
between population aging and economic growth and precluded an analysis of
the other variables that may affect economic growth. Hence, the limitation of this
study is the omission of these other variables, such as social security and pension
schemes as the data were country-specific, and thus a lack of comparable data. However,
it is hoped that this paper will stimulate more research on the role of older
workers in explaining the inter-relationship between population aging and economic
development in developing countries at the national level.
8 Conclusion
The population of developing countries is aging rapidly. The ongoing demographic
changes in developing countries due to fertility decline and increasing longevity will
inevitably bring about significant implications for a country’s social and economic
development in the near future. Hence, this study is timely to provide some insights
on the role of older workers in mitigating the negative association between population
aging and economic growth in developing countries that have received little
research attention.

Appendix 2: Computation of the marginal effect of aging population
on growth for Eq. (4)
The marginal effect estimated in Table 12 shows that when the older persons’ labor
force participation rate is at a low level, an increase in the older population would
negatively influence the economic performance, but the negative impact is mitigated
by rising labor force participation of older people, regardless of the aging status. The
result suggests that the baseline finding on the role of older persons’ labor force participation
in mitigating the negative effect of population aging on economic growth
remains robust and is not affected by the aging status. Equation (4) is reproduced as
below to show the computation of marginal effect for countries with less than 7% of
older people and countries with at least 7% of older people:
For countries with less than 7% of older people (AGING = 0), the marginal effect
of population aging on economic growth depends on 3 . That is:
