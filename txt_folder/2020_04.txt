These micro-cracks are difficult to be dis-tinguished and analyzed. Yet, they diminish the capability of thecomponents significantly. To guarantee the safety and reliabilityof the material, products, and infrastructure, nondestructive test-ing technique (NDT) [1,2] is applied to evaluate the propertiesof materials without causing damage. Magnetic Particle Testing(MT), Penetration Testing (PT) and Radiographic Testing (RT) arethe conventional NDT methods for cracks detection. MT is effec-tive for detecting the surface and near-surface cracks. However,the detection procedure of MT is complicated, and it only works forferromagnetic material [3]. PT is sensitive to opening surface cracks[4]. However, the penetrant process requires to be cleaned andit produces pollution to the environment. RT can obtain intuitiveresults whereas the radiation is a potential issue [5]. In addi-tion, ultrasonic testing has a blind spot for surface and it requiresa coupling medium. Magnetic Flux Leakage Testing can only beused for the detection of ferromagnetic materials and it cannot be∗Corresponding author.E-mail address: bin gao@uestc.edu.cn (B. Gao).applied through the insulation and cladding. Eddy Current Testing(ECT) [6–8] is an effective and extensively non-destructive test-ing method for detecting conductive materials. It is a non-contactelectromagnetic inspection method without coupling agent andversatility contributing to various conductive materials. However,general ECT methods apply a probe based on winding coils withmechanical scanning over a surface. This resulted in a complexscanning path and decreases the detection sensitivity as well asreliability [9].The development of eddy current sensor arrays [10–13] presentsa good solution for complex scanning paths. Such sensor arraysare widely used in industrial applications [14–16]. Instead of tradi-tional ECT sensors, multiple elements uniformly spaced over thesurface providing nearly equal sensitivity over a surface profile.This, in turn, allows a comparison between the responses from dif-ferent array elements. In 1988, flexible eddy current arrays [17]with the coils fabricated on the thin flexible substrate are intro-duced due to its excellent conformability to the curved surfaces.Winding coils are replaced by planar coils whose thickness can beneglected. It assures a uniform AC magnetic field distribution onthe surface of the specimens. In addition, analytical analysis andmodel structure research on flexible eddy current array has arousedattention.

based on the giant magneto-resistive sensor with specific elec-tronics embedded were presented to detect magnetic field change[21,22–24]. Melcher et al. [25] proposed the Meandering WindingMagnetometer (MWM) array sensor which is specifically designedto provide measurements as electrical conductivity and magneticpermeability of materials. Zilberstein et al. [26,27] presented anMWM sensor array to monitor stress distribution. A potential appli-cation of MWM sensing to monitor, diagnose and assess the qualityof gas turbine components was investigated [28]. Ding et al. [9,29]developed two types of ultra-thin flexible eddy current proxim-ity sensor array for online measuring tiny gaps on smooth metalliccomponents. Mohammed et al. [30,31] investigated a sensor dedi-cated to the nondestructive evaluation of carbon fibers reinforcedpolymers. Sun. et.al proposed a novel rectangular eddy currentarray sensing film with one exciting coil and several sensing coils toquantitatively monitoring hole-edge crack growth in bolted joints[32]. Li et al. [33] researched a rosette-like eddy current array sensorfor fatigue defects around bolt hole in Structural Health Monitor-ing (SHM) [34]. However, the diameter of the bolt hole is 18 mmand the progressed sensitivity is around 20 %. Rosado et al. [35–37]designed a planar and a differential sensor array that could achievethe hollow axle inner surface inspection. This design focused onhollow axle inner surface inspection, which studied the axial andcircumferential defects with different depth. However, all defectsare 10 mm in length and the sensor is more sensitive to the trans-verse defects than longitudinal defects. The maximum sensitivitydoes not exceed about 30 %. Xie et al. [38,39] presented a circle exci-tation flexible eddy-current sensor array and a racetrack-like loopcoaxial disposition excitation. The circle one studied the influenceof the conductivity of the specimen and the number of turns of thepick-up on the testing results. However, all their defects lengths aregreater than 5 mm. Its sensitivity does not exceed 30 %. Therefore,the micro defects capability and the sensitivity inspection is still achallenge for the flexible array. In addition, studies on directionaldefects using flexible eddy current arrays are rare.In this paper, a novel flexible sensor array of eddy current NDTsystem is proposed to detect the surface micro defects. The trans-mitters are comprised of two square drive traces in parallel locationwhile pick-up traces are sandwiched between drive traces. Themagnetic distributing annularly around the excitation current cov-ers a large area and forms rectangular uniform eddy current whenits interactions with the conduct specimen. The contribution of thepaper can be listed as follows: 1) The magnetic field diverges aroundthe excitation winding and covers a large area. It has the capa-bility to micro-defects inspection. 2)The eddy current field withthe transmitting-receiving-transmitting structure on the specimenis rectangular and uniform. It has high sensitivity for the defectsinspection of different orientation and the direction resolution canreach to 15◦.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces themethodology part including the basic theory of the electromag-netic field and the design of the proposed sensor array structure.Section 3 conducts a simulation of the parameters influence themodel, optimization design technique and describes the results ofexperimental studies as well. In addition, conclusions are outlinedin Section 4. Finally, Section 5 is acknowledgment.2. MethodologyThe new double square exciting and multi-spiral staggered flex-ible sensor array detection system is sketched in Fig. 1. The sensorstructure is fabricated on three-layer polyester films through print-ing electronic technology. Thus, it changed from volumetric typecoils to planar coils whose thickness can be neglected. This deter-mines the fact that such a probe can be used on the surface of thespecimen where the lift-off can be reduced. Specifically, the trans-mitters are comprised of two square drive traces in parallel locationwhile pick-up traces are sandwiched between drive traces as shownin Fig. 2. Two parallel periodic square wave transmitters as markedwith blue and red windings, respectively. Pick-up coils are spiraltraces with multiple turns in each groove of the drive traces. Upperand lower rows of the detection coils have a small left and right off-set in order to cover more area during the scanning. Each basic unitis a combination of a half period of upper and lower excitation coilswith a 3 mm length. The following section describes the physicalmechanism of the proposed structure.2.1. The magnetic field generated by transmittersThe imposed spatial periodicity of the current excitation resultsin a periodic magnetic field, which interacts with the conductivesurface of the specimen and generates eddy currents [40]. Fig. 3shows the periodic magnetic field distribution. The blue line is thefirst layer transmitter and the red one is the third layer transmitter.The green arrows denote the direction of excitation current. Pur-ple dotted lines represent the distribution of magnetic lines. Whenalternating current is applied, the magnetic field will be generatedaround each section of the excitation winding. This magnetic fieldcan be judged by the right-hand rule and it is a closed magnetic cir-cuit formed around the axis of the excitation current. This magneticfield distribution covers a large area around and that interactionwith the material under it. Thus, it has a capability for tiny defectsinspection because of the range of disturbance that can be detected.2.2. Eddy current distribution and detection windings obtainedsignalsFig. 4 displays the eddy current distribution that should havethe inverse direction with the primary current. From Fig. 4 thissecondary current on the specimen is uniform and rectangular.The existence of defects will distort the eddy current field, whichwill couple the distorted magnetic field with the pickup windings.The angle of defect makes different rectangular eddy current unitschange while the signal difference in each unit reflects the defectinformation. Pick-up windings are located in the middle of the twotransmitting coils and on the side of their path. At this time, thedirect coupling energy between driver-pick-up is weak, the signalsfrom pick-up coils are derived from the indirect coupling energy,that is, the information about the tested sample. In addition, sensi-tivity can be optimized through the selection of the driver-pick-upcoil gap [39]. Therefore, the sensitivity can be improved and orien-tational defects can be detected.In Fig. 5 L1 is the maximum length, L2 is the minimum length, G1is the pick-up line width, and G2 is the gap of pick-up line betweentwo turns, N is the number of turns.

3. Experiment set-up3.1. Numerical simulationIn the simulation analysis, AC/DC module in COMSOL Multi-physics 5.3a is created to analyze the electromagnetic field. In thisstudy, a three-dimensional(3D) sensor model is included as shownin Fig. 6(a) for the model calculation. The mesh generation is illus-trated in Fig. 6 (b). The meshing is in the form of a free tetrahedronwhich is re-divided on the surface of the test piece. Consideringthe computation cost in time domain analysis, frequency domainanalysis is used in the AC/DC module.The simulation parameters are presented in Table 1. It includesthe windings, or the specimen size, and other properties. Further-more, the impaction of certain parameters on the test results willbe studied in the following section.In order to reduce the memory consumption of computers, thisarray can be simplified into six units for analysis.

According to thecontinuity theorem of current, the original eddy current flow pathchanges around the edge of the defect when there exists a defect onthe surface. In order to obtain the optimal detection performanceof the probe, the following analysis including probe parametersand frequency have been conducted in the simulation. In addition,the mapping relationship between signal characteristics and defectsize as well as direction is investigated. The variation indicates thepick-up coil above the defect, as marked as CH5 shown in Fig. 8.‘Parameters sweep’ was applied to the whole probe and the pick-up coils whom close to the defect have larger variation. Thus, theCH5 unit was chosen for impaction effects in the study.3.1.1. Impaction analysis of pick-up linewidthAccording to the methodology in Section 2, pick-up linewidthis an important parameter to improve the signal strength and sen-sitivity. In this study, a single variable method has been adoptedto compare the effects of different pick-up linewidth on the signal,that is, the number of turns keeps the same and the linewidth of0.1 mm, 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm were investigated. From the simula-tion results, both imaginary and real part of the transimpedance isshown in Fig. 9.Results indicate that the amplitude of transimpendancebecomes bigger as the linewidth decreases. The reason can beexplained by the Eqs. (2) and (3), When L1 and L2 are deter-mined, the sum of linewidth G1 and gap G2 gets smaller when thelinewidth becomes thinner. Thus, the number of turns increasesleads to an increase in the output signal strength. However, theimaginary and the real part have a different range of displacementvariation for the same defect because of this study conducted with a3D simulation of COMSOL software. Compared with 2D calculation,3D modeling increases the freedom of solution, mesh generationcomplexity as well as impaction of the convergence of the calcula-tion. In this paper, the thickness of windings and spiral rectangularhelix are significant thin and the meshes adopted free tetrahedrons.Besides, due to the existence of defects, the ’Swept’ mesh cannotbe applied to decrease the number of elements. Hence, it is difficultto ensure that the mesh is completely uniform and it appears in adifferent range of displacement variation for the same defect.3.1.2. Impaction analysis of frequencyPlanar coils can obtain good performance in conductivity mea-surement at high frequencies where the frequency is generallyranged from 100 kHz to 10 MHz. This relatively high frequencyon eddy current testing is more helpful in detecting near-surfacecracks due to the skin depth. In this study, the frequency is investi-gated at 100 kHz-2 MHz. In Fig. 10(a), we can see a more intuitiveresponse frequency from the changing trend. The validated resultindicates that the output differential signal (Vdefect-Vdefect-free)increases as the frequency increases. However, f means the volt-age change as the frequency-changing, the progress of variationis shown in Fig. 10(b). f1to f2is ranged from 0 to V2-V1andthe change gradually decreases in the next frequencies. A peakoccurs at 200 kHz due to the frequency step is 100KHz. If increasesthe step, the change will slow down and the peak will diminish.Beyond that, from the frequency-maximum output voltage changecurve, it can be seen that the change value almost stays stablearound 1.4 MHz. Hence, this paper choses 1.4 MHz as the optimalfrequency.3.1.3. Impaction analysis of defects detection with different sizeThe response of the probe to different size of defects have beenstudied, including length, width, and depth. Fig. 11(a), (c) and (e)shows that the change of the imaginary part of the transimpedancein accordance with displacement when defect length increasesfrom 0.4 mm to 0.8 mm, width increase from 0.8 mm to 1.6 mm anddepth increase from 0.16 mm to 0.24 mm. Furthermore, in compar-ison with multiple sets of data, the peak-to-peak response signal ispresented in Fig. 11(b), (d), (f), respectively.The length, width, and depth have been labeled in Fig. 8. In termsof length and width of the defects, the scanning direction and stepsare the same. Considering the edge effect and plate size parameters,the air domain, and plate size, as well as mesh grid, will be adjustedonce increase the defect length. Hence, the length of the defect isshorter than the width. As can be seen from Fig. 11, the responsesignal is enhanced with an increase in detects size. In Fig. 11(b),peak-to-peak value of the voltage is gradually increased as defectlength increases from 0.1 mm to 1 mm. In contrast, peak-peak ofpick-up voltage approximately begins to slow down at 1.4 mm asthe defect width increases from 0.4 mm to 2 mm, which is shownin Fig. 11(d). As for depth prediction (Fig. 11(f)), the peak-to-peakvalue increases rapidly at the beginning and then gradually slowsdown with the increase of the defect depth. Fig. 11 (e) shows therelationship between the output voltage and the scanning displace-ment. In COMSOL software, we set ‘Parameter sweep’ for movingthe probe to obtain the Vdefect-Vdefect-freeresponse as the defectsare set with the same length and width whereas they have a dif-ferent depth. Fig. 11 (e) explains the maximum output for differentdefects depth. Under these circumstances, we fix the position of theprobe at the most sensitive displacement. Then, we use ‘parame-ter sweep’ to change the defect depth. Comparison of these twosweep method, the former consumes more time and computerresources. Fig.11 (f) studied a large range of depth variation andFig. 11 (e) is a part of the research scope of Fig. 11 (f). Thus, Fig. 11(f) has a difference compared with Fig. 11 (e). It can be seen thatthe depth variation can be regarded as monotonous from 0.1 mmto 1 mm. Within this boundary, defects disturb the eddy current.On the contrary, when defects are deeper than 1.1 mm, the eddycurrent is consistent as the response does not change along withdefect depth.

Impaction analysis of frequency: a) Maximum output as frequency from 0.1 MHz to 2 MHz with a step of 0.1 MHz b) Frequency-maximum output voltage change.In addition, each channel is represented as a unit in this sensorarray. When the sensor is scanning on the surface with a step of1 mm, the time for each part to pass the defect is not the same.It can be observed and compared between the relationship of dis-placement and voltage to evaluate the full profile of the defects.Fig. 12(a) and (b) display results as the defect is 4 mm × 0.5 mm× 0.5 mm. This crack spans three units and each channel has a dif-ferent change level. The scanning direction is from bottom to top.Therefore, the signal from CH1 to CH3 has a displacement differ-ence comparing with CH4 to CH6. The signals in the next row are 2mm behind those in the upper row, which determined by the struc-ture. In addition, as mentioned in III. A (a), with the complexity of3D mesh generation, the end of the exciting winding is stretchedas the output in order to keep conservation of current due to thegeometry impaction as shown in Fig. 12(a). Thus, CH3 and CH6 havea large difference between CH1 and CH4 because the geometry isnot completely asymmetry.3.1.4. Impaction analysis of the different orientation of the defectsIn Fig. 13, the white rectangular part is simulated as the surfacecrack, the blue trace is magnetic density norm and the white arrowdenotes the eddy current distribution with six angles from 0◦, 15◦,30◦, 60◦, 75◦, 90◦, respectively. Due to the presence of defects, theflow path of the eddy current is hindered. The numerical results fordifferent orientation cracks are presented in Fig. 13. With the samedefect size in different orientations, the sensitivity of each channelis distinctive. Fig. 14 illustrates that corresponding detection coilscapture different signal characteristics although the defect orien-

In the discontinuous region, the inductive signalis an obvious bulge. Hence, for near-surface defects, the proposedstructure has certain detection capabilities in different directionsfor defects. However, the defect detection results will be affectedwhen the defect is significantly larger or smaller than that of thearray unit. Besides, if the defects are shorter than the size of thesensor unit and larger than the excitation linewidth, the defect canbe detected whereas the sensitivity of orientation is not sufficientlyhigh.3.2. Experimental study and validationThe proposed experimental platform of the double square wind-ing flexible eddy current array is shown in Fig. 15. The proposedflexible array consists of a two-layer periodic square transmitterwith respect to x-axis symmetry. The selection of L1 is accordingto the array unit length and L2 is obtained according to the man-ufacturing technique. In addition, in the pick-up linewidth study,we adopted a single variable method. The conclusion of the sec-tion explained that the thinner linewidth can increase the signalstrength. L1 is 2.88 mm according to the array unit length, L2 is 1mm according to the manufacturing technique. The pick-up coilswith linewidth are 6 um and 47 turns (Fig. 5). Four specimensof #316 austenitic stainless steel and an exhaust pipe with var-ious groups of defects size (including orientation, length, widthand irregular sample with natural defect and crack) have beeninvestigated in the experimental study for validation. Signal pro-cessing circuits combined with an CE 623 instrument amplifier anda fourth-order low-pass filter with NE5532p are used. The ampli-tude of the exciting current in sine mode is 1 A with a frequency of1.4 MHz. The processed signal is observed by a using oscilloscopeand then transmitted to a PC for further analysis.Table 2 shows the specimens with diverse defects. #1 and #2are regular artificial defects, #3 is an irregular-shaped pipe with a

At the top of the specimen in #1, three cracks withdifferent angles of 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦are displayed. Besides, threegroups of defects whose length/width is increased from 0.5 mmto 4.5 mm with a step size of 0.5 mm are included. Three rect-angular defects with the same length 10 mm and width 0.5 mmwhereas different depth at 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm are shownin #2. A defect is approximately 1.5 mm length and 2 mm width atthe back of the pipe in #3. The sensitivity of the proposed flexibleeddy current array is tested under above the three cases. Speci-men #1 verifies the regular length, width and orientation analysis.Specimen #2 verifies the depth change analysis and specimen #3can demonstrate the advantages of the proposed flexible probe onirregular samples.Fig. 16 summarizes the experimental results.

The simulation trend is basically

The platform of the experimental setup.in agreement with the experimental according to the experimentaland simulation results. Although the simulation value is higher thanthat of the experimental results, their trend of change is consistent.The reason is that since the high-frequency excitation, several elec-tromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems exist in the actual testprocess.The defects with an angle of 30◦and 45◦have been validatedthrough imaging a region. The pace of scanning is a unit length. Topof Fig. 16. (7) (8) is a physical map of the proposed flexible eddy cur-rent array.

For the defect withthe orientation of 30◦, the image appears as two grids juxtaposed astwo cells in the same row vector covering the entire defect. In con-trast, for the defect with the orientation of 45◦, the adjacent tworows of the windings are diagonally coincident. In addition, lightblue and yellow images indicate the different defect sizes in twolocations in the defective region. Thus, the relative position of the

sensor and the defect affects the output voltage amplitude. Fig. 16and Fig. 17 shows a detectable yellow region located in the center ofthe blue background, which presented the defect region. It does notaffect the test results although tiny electronic noise incorporatedin the background because of the complex shaped pipe. However,conventional traditional wound probes are basically incapable todetect accurately on this complex-shaped surface.Despite this, the defect can still be clearly expressed. Therefore,this proposed sensor structure has the capability of inspection forcomplex shaped defects.According to the sensitivity formula, sensitivity value can becalculated. Table 3 shows the correlation coefficients between theparameters of defects and sensitivity. It summarizes the sensitiv-ity results of the proposed system for artificial defects and naturalcrack with different length, width, depth, and orientation. Thus, forartificial defects, the sensitivity increases as the size of the defectincreases. In addition, the defects size and corresponding sensi-tivity have a high correlation. In addition, a variation of lengthand width shows a similar tendency. The sensitivity and correla-tion coefficients of length and width show a similar tendency. Thesensitivity of depth is relatively low due to a flexible array whichgenerally works at 100 kHz-10 MHz. For natural defects, the pro-posed method has the detectability with the sensitivity of 0.0783.In order to double confirm the capability of highly sensitivedetection of the proposed method, new natural crack validationexperiment has been added. Fig. 15 is an exhaust pipe for carindustry with a natural crack and made of ferromagnetic mate-rial. The pipe has an irregular shape. Fig. 15 (b) shows the imagethrough scanning the fracture centered region. The x-axis denotesthe response of each column of the array. Similarly, the y-axispresents the number of scanning rows and the z-axis is the differ-ential output signal. Fig. 15 (b) shows that this anomaly occupiesthree coordinate value and the color contrast is more obvious. Theresult is consistent with the actual location of the defect. Besides,the size of the crack on the right side is larger than the left side.Thus, the color contrast reflects signal strength and the detectionsensitivity is 0.5364.4. Conclusion and future workThis paper proposes a flexible double square winding eddycurrent array structure for detecting surface micro-defects. Thisframework with double period square exciter and multiple turnspick-up coils improved sensitivity, directional capability, anddetectability of micro defects. In the experimental analysis, bothartificial defects and a complex-shaped pipe with the natural defecthas been validated. It is evidenced that the proposed work has agood trend among the response and multivariable types, thoughthe actual experiments and simulations results have numericaldifferences. The directional resolution of defects can reach 15◦.The smallest size of the crack with a length of 0.5 mm, a widthof 0.5 mm and a depth of 0.1 mm can be detected. The sim-ulation results are consistent with the experimental results. Inparticular, the proposed system has shown a high level of sensi-tivity with crack detection of different lengths, width, depth andorientation, which can reach 0.8268, 0.6510, 0.2892 and 0.8352respectively. The correlation coefficients among defects size andcorresponding sensitivity are relatively high. A shaped pipe with anatural defect is validated of a better detectability and an exhaustpipe for cars with natural cracks has been double confirmed.Future research will focus on near-surface and subsurface defectsinspection with complex geometry and quantitative analysis fordefects.Authorship statementQiuping Ma and Bin Gao contribute the writing of the paper,Guiyun Tian contribute the editing of the paper.
