Flexible wearable electronics have attracted tremendous interest owing to their potential applications on artificial
intelligence, electronic skin, human health monitoring, etc. However, it remains challenging to fabricate
electronic textiles (E-textiles) without sacrificing the air/vapor breathability, flexibility and comfortability. To
address these issues, we develop a novel surface reconstruction strategy through the facile and scalable paddrying
technology towards the breathable, flexible, highly conductive, bark-shaped MXene/textiles (BMFs).
The formation mechanism of bark-shaped morphology is clarified in detail. Benefiting from synergistic effects
between the bark-shaped MXene microstructure and porous structure of textiles, BMFs show excellent piezoresistive
sensing performance and good electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance. In addition,
BMFs achieve remarkable joule heating performance of 146.7 ◦C at 5 V, which is even superior to the silver
nanowire decorated fabrics. This work provides a new approach for the scalable fabrication of E-textiles, and lays
the foundation for the next generation wearable electronics.
1. Introduction
The textile-based electronics have drawn increasing attention in
recent years, owing to their potential applications on flexible displays,
portable energy harvest/conversion, wireless communications and
heath monitoring [1–3]. However, embedding the electronic devices
into fabrics usually sacrificed the intrinsic properties of fabrics, such as
breathability, flexibility and wearing comfortability. Therefore, it remains
challenging to seamlessly integrate multiple functions into the
fabrics without sacrificing their intrinsic properties. Fabric modification
by functional guests has been proved to be an alternative to achieve the
goal of wearable electronics, which has been verified in a number of
studies [4].
Various functional guests were adopted to decorate the fabrics,
including metal nanomaterials, conducting polymers, carbon nanomaterials.
For example, silver nanowire coated PET fabrics delivered
multiple functions, such as pressure sensing, thermal insulation, joule
heating, and particulate matter filtration [5]; The directional water
transport and capacitive sensing function can be achieved for the
polypyrrole coated cotton fabrics [6]; Single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs)/glucaric acid/chitosan coated fabrics exhibited high water/
organic solvents resistance and electromagnetic interference shielding
(EMI) effectiveness of 30 dB (X-band) [7]. Although multiple functions
can be obtained for the fabrics through the surface modification by
above conductive fillers, they showed the shortcomings of either high
cost, low durability or low electrical conductivity.
The transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) have attracted
much attention in recent years because of their outstanding properties
including high electrical conductivity, specific surface area, pseudocapacitance,
and good dispersion [8]. The general formula of MXenes is
Mn+1XnTx, where M stands for an transition metal (Ti, Mo, Nb, Cr, V,
etc.), X represents carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx is terminated functional
groups (e.g., –OH, -O, -F, etc.) [9]. Benefiting from its unique
structure and remarkable performances, MXene holds enormous potential
for emerging wearable electronics, including heat physiotherapy,
flexible energy storage, EMI shielding [10–14]. So far, a variety of
MXene decorated fabrics have been fabricated and exhibited multiple
functions. For instance, MXene dispersion was spray-coated on fabrics,

and the prepared composite fabrics exhibited good joule heating
(150 ◦C, 6 V), EMI shielding (36 dB), and strain sensing performance
[15]; Thermoplastic polyurethane fabric dip-coated by MXene/cellulose
nanocrystal displayed a broad strain sensing range of 83% and high
sensitivity (gauge factor = 3405) [16]; MXene-coated synthetic yarns
were knitted into planar supercapacitors, and the fabricated supercapacitor
demonstrated a high capacitance of 519 mF/cm2 in 1 M
H3PO4-PVA gel electrolyte [17]. Despite these progress, large-scale
manufacture of MXene modified fabrics with good uniformity and
controllable morphology still faces significant hurdles. Especially, the
MXene distribution has a profound effect on both the structure and
performance of the composite fabrics: (i) The uniform distribution of
MXene flakes will benefit for constructing continuous conductive networks,
rendering the composite fabrics with good structural integrity.
(ii) The distribution of MXene flakes also plays an important role in
determining the application performance of the composite fabrics, as the
joule heating transfer, electromagnetic wave absorption, and pressure
sensing current are greatly affected by MXene distribution. Besides, it
should be explored the structure-effective relationship between the
morphology and performance of the MXene-based composite fabrics.
Bark, as a fundamental part of the trees, plays an important role in
directing, transporting, and concentrating water and nutrients [18].
Analogously, bark-shaped morphology has profound effects on performances
of the electronic fabrics, especially on the piezoresistive sensing
and EMI shielding performances owing to the following factors: (i) The
insertion and de-intercalation of wrinkled MXene sheets in the grooves
of bark-shaped fibers will result in the changes of conductive pathways
and the corresponding contact resistance, benefiting for improving its
piezoresistive sensing performance; (ii) The bark-shaped morphology
enhances the multiple interfaces scattering of electromagnetic waves,
which can improve the EMI shielding effectiveness. However, barkshaped
MXene decorated fabrics have not yet been realized through
the post-treatment, and further effort is required to systematically
investigate their structure-effective relationships.
Pad-drying technology has been widely applied to the dyeing process
of yarns and fabrics, which has demonstrated several advantages
including scalability, energy conservation, good evenness [19]. Inspired
by the dyeing of fabrics, we decorated the cellulose nonwoven fabrics
with MXene flakes through the pad-drying process, and the prepared
fabrics are expected to have good uniformity, durability and electrical
conductivity owing to the following factors: (i) Both cellulose and
MXene are hydrophilic, and hydron bonding will be constructed between
the cellulose fabric and MXene flakes, leading to the high binding
fastness and durability; (ii) The wicking effects of fabrics helps the absorption
of MXene; (iii) During the pad-drying, the high pressure accelerates
the diffusion of MXene from the surface into the inside of
fabrics. Consequently, the fabrics show good uniformity and are electrically
conductive on both the surface and inside. (iv) The high pressure
facilitates the shearing-induced orientation of MXene sheets during the
pad-drying, and unique morphology will be formed for the fibers, which
can not deteriorate the breathability of fabrics. However, to date,
breathable, durable, and multifunctional MXene-based fabrics using the
pad-drying techniques have yet to be developed.
Herein, we developed a novel, scalable and facile pad-drying
approach to fabricate the breathable, durable, and multifunctional
MXene decorated fabrics. We studied the micromorphology, joule
heating, EMI shielding, and pressure sensing performance of the fabricated
MXene-based fabrics (BMFs). The BMFs showed bark-shaped
morphology, good flexibility, air/vapor permeability, and low sheet
resistance of 2.2 Ω/□. The BMFs showed high EMI shielding effectiveness
of 35.2 dB and a distinctive EMI shielding mechanism. In addition,
BMFs demonstrated excellent piezoresistive sensing performance
including high sensitivity (28.723 kPa􀀀 1), wide sensing range (0–17.4
kPa), high linearity (R2 = 0.996), and rapid response/recovery time, and
showed high sensitivity for monitoring the human motions. Moreover,
the BMFs exhibited remarkable joule heating performance
(electrothermal temperature 146.7 ◦C at 5 V). This work provides a new
approach for the structure design of E-textiles and lays the foundation
for the next generation wearable electronics.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Lithium fluoride (purity, 99.99%) was purchased from Shanghai
Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., China. Hydrochloric acid
(HCl, 36.0–38.0 wt%) and ethanol (≥99.7 wt%) were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Ti3AlC2 (MAX) was
purchased from 11 Technology Co., Ltd, (Jilin, China). Cellulose
nonwoven fabrics were received from Hangzhou Sijin nonwoven fabric
Co., Ltd, (grammage: 100 g/m2). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard
184 Silicone Elastomer) containing base polymer (Kit A, 1 kg) and
curing agent (Kit B, 100 g), was purchased from Dow Corning Corp.,
USA. Interdigitated electrodes patterned on the transparent PI substrate
with a size of 10 × 20 mm2 (Au/Cu thickness, 1/12 μm) were purchased
from Guangzhou Yuxin sensor technology Co., Ltd. All the chemicals
were received as purchased without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx
Ti3C2Tx MXene was synthesized through the in-situ HF etching
method [20,21], where the HF was formed by adding the lithium fluoride
to the hydrochloric acid. In detail, 2 g lithium fluoride (LiF) and 2 g
Ti3AlC2 (MAX) were added into the 40 mL 9 M hydrochloric acid (HCl),
respectively. The mixture was kept at 35 ◦C for 24 h, and the resultant
suspension was rinsed with the deionized water for several cycles until
the pH was 6. The precipitation was collected and intercalated by the
ethanol via the ultrasonication at 100 W for 1 h and centrifuged at
10000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the sediment was collected and redispersed
into DI water through ultrasonication (750 W, 20 min), and
the delaminated few-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets were collected via
the reduplicative centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 3 min.
2.3. Preparation of BMFs
The BMFs were fabricated via the pad-drying method. In detail, the
cellulose nonwoven fabrics were firstly immersed into the 3 mg/mL
MXene aqueous dispersion, and the wet MXene treated fabrics were
directly fed into the padder to remove the excess water at the stress of
0.1 ~ 0.3 MPa. The MXene treated fabrics were dried at 60 ◦C for 10
min. The pad-drying process was repeated for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
cycles, and the prepared fabrics were labeled as BMF-1, BMF-2, BMF-3,
BMF-4, BMF-5, BMF-6, BMF-7, BMF-8, and BMF-9, respectively.
2.4. Fabrication of BMF based pressure sensors
To fabricate the BMF based pressure sensors, thin PDMS film was
firstly prepared. In detail, the curing agent and PDMS base polymer were
mixed with a mass ratio of 1:10, which was then degassed and dipped
onto the glass plate following by curing at 80 ◦C for 2 h. The thickness of
the PDMS film was controlled by tuning the mass of PDMS. Eventually,
the BMFs were sandwiched between an interdigitated electrode and a
PDMS film to form the BMF based pressure sensors.
2.5. Characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using the
Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer. The morphology of the samples
was observed through the Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.
The MXene loading ratio was calculated by using the following equation:
W = (m 􀀀 m0)/m0 × 100% (1)

where the m0 and m were the weight of untreated fabrics and MXene
modified fabrics, respectively. The electrical surface resistivity of fabrics
was measured through a multimeter following the AATCC 76–2005
standard. The joule heating performance of samples was characterized
by using the FLIR A320 infrared camera. The electromagnetic interference
shielding performance was characterized by an Agilent PNAN5244A
microwave network analyzer. The pressure sensing performance
of fabrics were characterized by the Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT
204 electrochemical workstation, and the set-up was shown in Fig. S1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fabrication of BMFs
The bark-shaped MXene decorated fabrics (BMFs) were fabricated
through the facile and scalable pad-drying process (Fig. 1a). In brief,
large and few-layered MXene sheets were firstly synthesized via in-situ
HF (HCl + LiF) etching method and ultrasonication [20]. The cellulose
nonwoven fabrics were firstly immersed into the MXene dispersion and
subsequently dried to remove superfluous water. The pad-drying process
was repeated for several cycles to increase the MXene loading. The
cellulose nonwoven fabrics were selected as the substrate for depositing
the MXene, as the cellulose fibers are hydrophilic, and thus MXene
sheets can be tightly adhered to the surface of cellulose fibers owing to
the hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the hydrogen bonding will render the
fabrics with good durability. In addition, aligned MXene sheets will be
deposited on the surface of fibers because of the shearing-induced
orientation of MXene sheets during the squeezing process, and then
the released residual stress will lead to the buckle of MXene sheets to
form the bark-shaped morphology.
The BMFs are desirable for wearable applications (Fig. 1b). For
instance, the BMFs are expected to have good air/vapor breathability
based on the surface reconstruction strategy, which is important for
keeping the thermal/wet comfortability. Benefiting from the barkshaped
morphology, the EMI shielding performance will be improved
because of the multiple interfaces scattering of electromagnetic waves
on the fiber surface. In addition, the contact resistance of the fibers will
be reduced owing to the bark-shaped morphology, leading to the good
piezoresistive sensing performance of the fabrics. Moreover, good joule
heating performance can be achieved for the BMFs due to the good
electrical conductivity of MXene.
Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of MAX and MXene. It can be seen
that the highest diffraction peak at 2θ = 38.9◦ disappeared, and there
was only a (002) peak located at 6.1◦, implying the Al element has been
successfully etched, and the multilayer MXene sheets have been
delaminated into few-layered MXene after the selective etching [21].

Fig. 2b shows a typical low-magnification transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of the synthesized MXene, in which the MXene exhibits
the irregular rectangle shape with the length of 0.97 μm. More
than 100 MXene sheets were counted and their lateral size distribution
was shown in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that the lateral size of MXene sheets
obeys a normal distribution with the average value and standard deviation
of 629.2 nm and 577.6 nm, respectively. The lateral size of the
synthesized MXene is on par with or exceeds those in previous reports
[22,23]. The large MXene sheets will construct continuous conductive
pathways for electrons, benefiting for improving the electrical conductivity
of the MXene decorated fabrics. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image shows that the MXene presents the hexagonal lattice with the
interlayer spacing of 0.2676 nm (Fig. 2d), which matches well with the
(010) planes of the Ti3C2 [21].
As shown in Fig. 2e, the BMF-1 shows the sheet resistance of 4850 ±
50 Ω/□ because of the low loading of MXene (1.9 wt%). The sheet
resistance decreased with the pad-drying cycles and the BMF-9 shows
the lowest sheet resistance of 2.2 ± 0.2 Ω/□. In contrast, the electrical
conductivity increased with the pad-drying cycles and the maximum
electrical conductivity can be up to 887.7 ± 80.7 S/m for BMF-9
(Fig. S3), which was also comparable with other reported MXenebased
fabrics [24]. The decreased sheet resistance of BMFs was mainly
attributed to the increased MXene content, and the maximum MXene
loading can be up to 14.5 wt% for BMF-9 (Fig. S4). To further confirm
the good electrical conductivity of BMF, we observed the distribution of
MXene in the nonwoven fabric through the 3D super depth digital microscopy
(Fig. S5). The untreated cellulose fabric shows a clean surface
without any MXene attached to the fibers. With the increase of paddrying
cycles, more and more MXene adhered on the fibers, and fibers
were even adhered together by the MXene sheets to construct the
continuous networks for the BMF-8 and BMF-9. Therefore, BMF-8 and
BMF-9 show lower sheet resistance than that of others. Furthermore,
BMF-9 can be used as the flexible conductor to light the “AHPU” logo at
3 V, further implying its high electrical conductivity.
The BMFs can be continuously fabricated in large scale via the paddrying
method (Fig. 2f). In addition, the BMFs are bendable and foldable
(Fig. 2g-2 h), demonstrating their good flexibility. Air permeability, as
an important index of the gas molecules penetrating ability, plays a
crucial role in determining the wet and thermal comfortability of the
apparel. The untreated fabric has an air permeability of 969.9 ± 1.8
mm/s (97.0 ± 0.2 cm3/cm2/s) as illustrated in Fig. S6. Surprisingly, the
air permeability was increased to 1577.9 ± 5.9 mm/s after 7 pad-drying
cycles, which may be ascribed from the stretching-induced decrease of
the area density of nonwoven fabrics. However, BMF-9 exhibits lower
air permeability of 954.9 ± 13.9 mm/s (95.5 ± 1.4 cm3/cm2/s)
compared with the BMF-7 but comparable air permeability with the
untreated fabric, indicating the good air permeability of BMF-9.
As evidenced in Fig. 2i and 2j, lots of white fog comes out from the
BMF-9 covered glass bottle containing concentrated HCl, analogous to
that counterpart covered by the untreated textiles. Therefore, good air
permeability can be maintained for the BMFs. To further prove the vapor
permeability, we conducted the condensation experiment, where the
glass bottles were filled with boiling water, covered with fabrics, and
placed under the beaker. After 1 min, many water drops can be observed
on the top of the beaker for both the BMF-9 and pristine textile (Fig. 2k),
implying the water vapor can penetrate the two fabrics. Therefore, BMF-
9 shows good air/vapor breathability. More importantly, the boiling
water kept clear after the BMF-9 was washed and stirred in the boiling

water for 1 h (Fig. 2l), indicating the good durability of BMF-9. The good
durability of BMFs was attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding between
the hydrophilic cellulose fibers and MXene sheets.
3.2. Morphology
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of BMFs were
shown in Fig. 3. The untreated fabrics show the clean surface without
any purities on the fiber surface (Fig. S7). However, the surface of fibers
changed to be rough, and the wrinkled MXene sheets can be observed for
the BMF-1 (Fig. 3a). The deposition of MXene sheets on the fibers was
attributed to the following factors: (i) Both the cellulose nonwoven
fabric and MXene are hydrophilic, and thus the MXene can be deposited
on the fibers via the hydrogen bonding; (ii) The wicking effects also
helps the absorption of MXene sheets because of the porous structure of
nonwoven fabrics. More MXene sheets can be found on the surface of
fibers when the pad-drying cycles was increased to 5 (Fig. 3b). High
magnification SEM images of BMF-5 show that MXene sheets oriented
along the fiber axis to form the continuous bark-shaped film (Fig. 3b2).
For the BMF-9, MXene sheets were not only filled in the gaps between
the fibers, but also coated on the surface of fibers with bark-shaped
morphology containing more grooves and bumps (Fig. 3c). The interconnected
networks built by the MXene sheets will construct continuous
pathways for the electrons, leading to the good electrical properties of
the BMF-9.
To further analyze the MXene distribution in the fabrics, we observed
the cross section of BMF-9 and the corresponding energy-dispersive Xray
spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping images as shown in Fig. 3d and
3e. MXene sheets were distributed in both the inside and surface of
fabrics, and bark-shaped MXene sheets can be also observed on the
surface of inner fibers (Fig. 3d1), implying the uniform structure of the
BMF-9 and the high penetration ability of MXene dispersion during the
pad-drying process. In addition, the fibers were evenly wrapped by the
MXene films with the thickness about 70 nm (Fig. 3d2). The EDS mapping
image of Ti, C and O further revealed that the MXene was evenly
distributed in the whole fabric for the BMF-9 (Fig. 3e). Moreover, BMF-9

exhibits higher MXene loading ratio compared with BMF-7 and BMF-8
(Fig. S8 and S9). As a result, the high MXene content and uniform
bark-shaped MXene film ensured the high electrical conductivity of
BMFs.
We attempted to analyze the reason for the bark-shaped morphology
of BMF-9 as illustrated in Fig. S10. The excess water will be squeezed out
when the nonwoven fabrics containing MXene dispersion passed
through the gaps of a pair of rolls. Thus, the residual MXene dispersion
flowed along the fibers, and aligned MXene sheets will be deposited on
the pre-stretched fibers owing to the shearing-flow induced orientation.
After the release of pre-tension, the release of the residual stress of
MXene sheets resulted in buckling of aligned MXene sheets to form the
wrinkled MXene sheets and bark-shaped fiber morphology.
3.3. Electrothermal and EMI shielding performance
The electrothermal performance of the BMFs was evaluated by using
the thermal infrared camera, which is shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed
that the BMF-9 was evenly heated at various voltages (Fig. 4a-4c),
indicating the uniform distribution of MXene sheets on the fabrics. In
addition, the BMF-9 shows higher temperature than that of BMF-8 at all
the applied voltages (Fig. S11), which was in good consistent with the
Fig. 4. Electrothermal performance of the Bark-like MXene decorated fabrics. (a)-(c) Thermal infrared images of BMF-9 at the voltage of 3 V, 4 V and 5 V,
respectively. Time-temperature curves of BMF-8 (d) and BMF-9 (e). (f) Comparison of electrothermal performance of the as prepared BMF with the previously

cotton fabric [20], PANI/PET fabric [27], nanowire coated fabric [25], PDA/MXene@PP fabric [4].

sheet resistance results. The real-time temperature of the fabrics was
also obtained from the infrared images, which was shown in Fig. 4d and
4e. The surface temperature of BMF-8 was rapidly increased with the
applied voltages and exhibited the surface temperature of 43.0 ◦C,
49.0 ◦C, and 68.4 ◦C at 3 V, 4 V, and 5 V (Fig. 4d), respectively. Similarly,
BMF-9 followed the same tendency and exhibited the highest
temperature of 146.7 ◦C (ΔT = 125.7 ◦C) at 5 V (Fig. 4e). Compared with
BMF-8, BMF-9 shows better electrothermal performance owing to its
lower sheet resistance. More importantly, the BMF-9 demonstrated one
of the state-of-the-art electrothermal performance, and its electrothermal
performance was superior to most of the metal nanowire coated
fabrics [25,26], conducting polymers modified fabrics [27], MXene
decorated fabrics [15], and their composites [20,24], even the graphene
paper [28]. For example, the surface temperature of BMF-9 (5 V) was
2.23 times that of nanowire coated fabrics (65.9 ◦C) [25], 25.9% higher
than that of MXene coated fabrics (116.5 ◦C, 5 V) [15], and 82.2%
higher than that of PPy/MXene coated fabrics (80.5 ◦C, 4 V) [24]. The
exceptional electrothermal performance of BMF-9 made it a promising
candidate as the portable and wearable heater for personal management
and heat physiotherapy.
Considering the high electrical conductivity of BMFs, they are expected
to have good EMI shielding performance, and their EMI shielding
performance under 8.2–12.4 GHz was evaluated as shown in Fig. 5. The
control and BMF-1 exhibit almost no EMI shielding performance because
of their inferior electrical properties. The EMI shielding effectiveness
(EMI SE) was incrementally increased from 3.2 dB to 36.3 dB by varying
the pad-drying cycles from 3 to 9 (Fig. 5a), which coincided with the
sheet resistance results. To provide a further understanding of the EMI
shielding mechanism, we subdivided the total EMI SET into multiple
reflection effectiveness (SEM), absorption effectiveness (SEA), and
reflection effectiveness (SER) as shown in equation (1):
SET = SER +SEA +SEM (2)
It is generally assumed that internal multiple reflection can be
negligible, when the total EMI SE value goes above 15 dB [29–33]. As a
result, the SET was constituted of SER and SEA. Fig. 5b shows the SER, SEA
and SET value of the BMFs. It can be seen that all the SET values were
increased with the pad-drying cycles, and the BMF-9 demonstrated the
highest average SET of 35.2 dB, which was comparable and even higher
than most CNT, MXene and conducting polymers decorated fabrics and
some MXene modified composites [15,20,34–39]. We also comprehensively
compared the EMI shielding performance between our BMFs and
other reported EMI shielding materials in terms of shielding performance
and material thickness (Fig. S12), as the material thickness plays
an important role in determining the EMI shielding performance. Our
BMF-9 has the low thickness (0.62 mm) but high EMI SET of 35.2 dB,
which is superior to other EMI shielding materials, including metalbased
materials [40], graphene-based materials [41], conducting
polymer-based materials [42], CNT-based materials [43], rGO-based
materials and MXene-based materials [44,45].
To evaluate the absorption percentage of incident electromagnetic
waves, we calculated the absorptivity (SEA/SET) as shown in Fig. 5c. The
absorptivity can be up to 77.7% for BMF-3 and then decreased to 56.1%
for BMF-9, implying the decreased contribution from the EM absorption.
In addition, to understand the EMI shielding mechanism of BMFs, we
also calculated the S parameters to obtain the reflection coefficient (R),
absorption coefficient (A) and transmission coefficient (T), which represents
the ratio of reflection, absorption and transmission of EM waves
(Fig. 5d). When the pad-drying cycle is below 3 times, BMFs show
inferior EMI shielding performance and higher A value than that of R,
and the maximum A value was 34.8%, indicating 34.8% EM wave absorption
and the absorption-dominant EMI shielding mechanism
[46–52]. R value dramatically increased and the maximum R value can

be 97.1% for BMF-9 when the pad-drying cycle was more than 3 times,
implying 97.1% EM waves was reflected and the shielding mechanism
was dominated by reflection. The similar results can be also found in
other nonwoven fabrics [53,54].
Fig. 5e-5 g illustrates the EMI shielding mechanism of BMFs. As for
the BMF-1 and BMF-3, the sufficiently conductive network is absent due
to the low MXene loading contents (below the percolation threshold),
and most of EM waves were transmitted the fabrics and only a part of the
incident EM waves can be absorbed by some small circulation loops
owing to the ohmic loss (Fig. 5f), which dissipated energy via mobile
charges conduction, hopping, tunneling, as well as some MXene flakes as
electric dipoles [54]. Therefore, Both BMF-1 and BMF-3 demonstrated
the absorption-dominant EMI shielding mechanism. Further increasing
the MXene loading leads to sufficient conductive networks and the
formation of bark-shaped surface morphology. As a result, the interactions
between the incident EM waves and the surface nomadic
charges/mobile charge carriers (holes or electrons) resulted in the
impedance mismatch between the BMFs and the air, and the majority of
EM waves were reflected (Fig. 5g). Moreover, the bark-shaped
morphology also contributes to the multiple reflections because of the
multiple interfaces scattering effects. Hence, the EMI shielding mechanism
transformed from the absorption-dominant to the reflectiondominant.
3.4. Piezoresistive sensor performance
To evaluate the piezoresistive performance of BMFs, they were
sandwiched between the PDMS film and interdigitated electrodes to
form the flexible pressure sensors (Fig. S13). The real-time current was
recorded under various pressure at the constant voltage, and the relative
current change percentage of the device is defined as ΔI/I0, where I0 is
the current without pressure and ΔI equals the real time current minus
the current under no pressure. Fig. 6a shows the relative current change
(ΔI/I0) of the BMF based pressure sensor (BMFPS) under the pressure of
163 Pa and 327 Pa. It can be seen that a fast current response can be
obtained at the above pressure, and BMFPS exhibited the ΔI/I0 of 23.1 at
327 Pa, which was about 100% higher than that of the sensor at 163 Pa.
Further increasing the pressure to 1 kPa led to higher ΔI/I0 value (32.4)
as shown in Fig. 6b, indicating the linear response of our BMFPS. In
addition, the response and relaxation time was 500 ms and 20 ms,
respectively, which was comparable with the MWCNT/PDMS film
pressure sensor (125–500 ms) [55] and longer than that of real human
skin (30–50 ms) [56].
Sensitivity, as one of the most important performance indexes for the
piezoresistive sensors, stands for the response rate of the sensors, which
can be defined as
S =
ΔI/I0
ΔP
where P is the applied pressure. As shown in Fig. 6c, the BMFPS had
the S value of 22.030 kPa􀀀 1 with linearity of R2 = 0.983 with pressure of
0–3.266 kPa. The sensitivity S exhibits the highest value of 28.723 kPa􀀀 1
with high linearity of R2 = 0.996 at the pressure of 3.266–12.2 kPa. A
reduction of the S value (10.222 kPa􀀀 1) in the pressure between 12.2
and 17.4 kPa, while the ΔI/I0 still exhibits the linear dependence with
pressure (R2 = 0.978). To the best of our knowledge, our BMFPS
demonstrated one of the highest sensitivity values among the reported
flexible pressure sensors (Fig. 6d) [23,55,57–72]. For example, our
BMFPS had comparable sensitivity with the surface microstructure
pressure sensors (ACNT/G/PDMS film, Ag/micropatterned PDMS film,
etc.) [58,62,63,71,72], but showed wider sensing range than them. Our
BMFPS also exhibited higher sensitivity than the porous structure
pressure sensors at the same sensing range [55,57,64,65,68,69], such as
the PEDOT:PSS/polyimide aerogels and rGO/polyaniline sponge. The

excellent piezoresistive sensing performance of our BMFPS may be
attributed to the synergetic effects between the porous structure of
fabrics and bark-shaped surface microstructure of MXene, which can be
explained as follows: (i) The bumps will be slipped and inserted into the
grooves of the bark, resulting in the increase of the fiber contact area, the
number of conductive pathways and the decrease of contact resistance
(Fig. 6e); (ii) The porosity of fabrics will be decreased under pressure,
leading to the decrease of fabric resistance.
To demonstrate the practical applications of our BMFPS, we used our
BMFPS to sense the small items including epoxy resin particle (~0.1 g),
binder clips (1.95 ~ 4.97 g) and metal key (18.3 g). Obvious and fast
current response signal can be read out upon the above items (Fig. 7a).
The wide sensing range and high sensitivity of BMFPS made it an
appealing candidate for real-time full-range human motion detections.
Our BMFPS were put under the finger and feet to monitor the finger
pressing and walking, where stable and repeatable sensing current can
be observed as shown in Fig. 7b and 7c. Therefore, the BMFPS demonstrated
great potential in guiding the physical rehabilitation training
through monitoring the movement of human body part. The BMFPS
were also adhered to the wrist to detect the pulse signal of the radial
artery as shown in Fig. 7d, and reproducible pulse waveforms with the
heart rate of 60 beats/min can be precisely recorded, implying the high
sensitivity and fast response of our sensors.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have regulated the surface microstructure of MXenecoated
fiber via a facile pad-drying technology to investigate the effects
of surface microstructure on the EMI shielding and piezoresistive
sensing performance of fabrics. The fiber morphology was depended on
the amount of MXene loading, and high loading MXene resulted in the
bark-shaped surface morphology. The EMI shielding mechanism was
shifted from absorption-dominant to reflection-dominant with the increase
of MXene content, and the bark-shaped morphology significantly
increased the EMI SE to 35.2 dB owing to the multiple interfaces scattering
and reflections of EM waves. In addition, the bark-shaped MXene/
fabrics (BMFs) showed excellent piezoresistive sensing performance
including high sensitivity (28.723 kPa􀀀 1), wide sensing range (0–17.4
kPa), high linearity (R2 = 0.996), and rapid response/recovery time. To
the best of our knowledge, the piezoresistive sensing performance of
BMFs surpasses those of one of the best ever reported pressure sensors.
Moreover, the BMFs demonstrated excellent joule heating performance
(146.7 ◦C, 5 V), which was even better than the silver nanowire modified
fabrics. This work provides a new strategy for the structure design of
functional textiles and presents potential applications in wearable
electronics, such as intelligent E-skin and heat physiotherapy.
