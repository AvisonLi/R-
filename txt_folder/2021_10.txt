Population Aging in Korea: Implications
for Fiscal Sustainability
Sungjin Cho and Jan R. Kim
Adverse demographics in Korea impinges on its growth potential
and fiscal outlook. Accordingly, this study examines the current
demographic situation and recent projections related to the impacts
of population aging in Korea, particularly on the looming fiscal
imbalance. The focal conclusion is that a two-way effect exists
from population aging. First is the anticipated stress placed on
government finances due to increasing welfare expenditure for the
elderly. Second is sluggish economic growth and thus the inability
to collect sufficient government revenues. The prospect of large
and growing deficits is therefore immediate and potentially long
lasting as governments will be faced with rising spending demands
and sluggish tax revenues arising simultaneously from an aging
population.

I. Introduction
Population aging is an irreversible global trend. According to the UN
(2017), a total of 962 million people are aged 60 years or over in 2017
Worldwide, which is an increase of 152 percent over the 383 million in
1980. This number is projected to grow to more than double its 2017
size, reaching nearly 2.1 billion. In terms of population aging, Korea
is one of the world’s fastest aging countries. Owing to the continued
extension of longevity couple with the steep decline in fertility rate, the
size and percentage of the elderly population (i.e., aged 65 and above)
rapidly increased in the past three decades. As of the end of 2019,
the share of people aged 65 or older was 15.5 percent out of the total
population, up from 14.2 percent in 2018. A study by the National
Statistics Office (2019) shows that Korea will become the world’s most
aged society by 2067, with the senior population to comprise 46.5
percent of the population.
Falling marriage rates and dismally low child births along with longer
life are the main causes of the country’s demographic crisis, calling
for concern about dire macroeconomic consequences. Despite ample
research over the past decades regarding the likely consequences
of population aging, on macroeconomy in general and government
finances in particular, policy action from the government’s end has
only recently begun its implementation. This current study aims
to grasp the current demographic situation and recent projections
regarding population aging in Korea, particularly on the macroeconomic
implication of population aging.
This study provides anecdotal and empirical investigation regarding
the effects of population aging on the Korean economy, focusing on
the two-way effect from population aging found in recent research
and projections. The first effect is the anticipated stress placed on
government finances due to increasing expenditure for the elderly as
examined in Hsu and Yamada (2019). As the population is getting older,
municipal and central governments are forced to devote additional
resources to meet the higher demands placed on programs such as
senior healthcare or pension, unless significant changes are made
in the structure of these programs or their benefits. The second
effect arising from population aging is sluggish economic growth as
discussed in Aksoy et al. (2019), which in turn leads to slower growth in
government revenues. As a lower proportion of population will be able
Population Aging in Korea 239
to participate in the labor market, overall rates of economic growth are
bound to fall, which will in turn have negative effects on governments’
ability to raise revenues. The prospect of large and growing deficits is
therefore immediate and potentially long lasting, as governments will
be faced with increasing spending demands but sluggish tax revenues
simultaneously arising from an aging population. For example, IMF
(2005) reports a one percent increase in labor force as improving fiscal
balance by 0.06 percent point, whereas a one percent point increase in
the aged population leads to a 0.041 percent point decrease in the percapita
GDP.
This study is structured as follows. The next section examines
the trend of demographic shift in Korea and the ensuing projected
changes in the near future. Possible impacts of this change on labor
markets and economic growth will also be assessed. We then analyze
how demographic changes are projected to impact spending on health
care and welfare programs for seniors. The next section analyzes how
spending surges in these areas affect the fiscal balance (deficits or
surpluses) of central government. In the final section, we develop an
empirical model to quantify the effect of population aging on the Korean
economy, with emphasis on labor productivity, income, and healthcare
spending. The paper ends with a brief conclusion.
II. Demographic Changes in Korea
The growth in a country’s population is affected by three factors:
birth rate, death rate, and net immigration. For much of her history,
the population growth in Korea was the result of natural increases,
i.e., the difference between births and deaths, whereas the role of net
immigration has been negligible. According to the National Statistics
Office (2019, 2020), however, Korea’s recent fertility rate has fallen
below the level necessary to replace existing population.1 The result of
1 The fertility rate is commonly defined as the number of births a woman
is expected to have by the end of her reproductive years. Since the 1990s,
the fertility in Korea has declined dramatically. In the early 1950s and 1960s,
the fertility rate in Korea was 5.6 children per women. By contrast, the figure
tumbled to 0.98 in 2018 and 0.92 in 2019. The current fertility rate is far below
the replacement fertility rate of 2.1, at which the size of total population is
maintained.
240 SEOUL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
a declining fertility rate has been a continued slowdown in population
growth. Figure 1 below illustrates such a drastic shift in demographics.
The average annual population growth rate in the 1970s was 2.2
percent, which is in stark contrast to the average annual population
growth rate for the most recent decade of 2009–2019 at only 0.48
percent. Compared with the 1960s, the recent figure is an 81 percent
decline. Based on the medium growth projection by the National
Statistics Office, Korea’s future population growth rate is projected to
continue declining. For example, the population growth rate is projected
to turn negative by 2029. By 2067, the end point in the current forecast
by the National Statistics Office (2020) predicts the population growth
rate to be -1.26 percent.

Notes: Data for 2020 and onwards are projections based on the mediumpopulation
growth scenario.

Population Aging in Korea 241
Apart from slower and even negative population growth, another
demographic shift Korea is expected to undergo is the increase in life
expectancy.2 For example, according to OECD (2019), life expectancy at
birth increased for women from 65.8 years to 85.71 years and for men
from 58.7 years to 79.7 years over the period of 1970 to 2017.
One combined effect of a lower population growth and extended life
expectancy is that seniors will take a fast-increasing portion of future
population. Figure 2 shows two aging-related statistics. Panel (a) plots
the share of those over the age of 65 among the entire population
starting in 2010. From 2010 to 2067, the seniors’ share in Korean
population is projected to increase from a little over 10 percent to over
46 percent. The growth rate will be highest from now until the late-
2030s, at which point the senior share of the population will have
increased to approximately 34 percent. This rapid increase in the share
of the population over 65 is a result of the aging of the so-called “baby
boomers,” those born in the years following the Korean War. The senior
share of the population is expected to grow at a little slower rate in the
decades after the late-2030s but continuously increasing to roughly 47
percent of the overall population by 2067. More striking in panel (b) is

that the age composition of the seniors is expected to shift toward those
over 75 years of age, whereas the share of relatively young seniors aged
between 65 and 69 is projected to decline.
The share of productive population will also be affected by this trend
of aging. Figure 3 shows the working age (15-64 years old) share of the
population from 1970 to 2063. This period is first characterized by a
rapid increase in the share of the working age population as the baby
boomers entered the labor force in the early period of fast economic
growth. The working age share of the total population peaked in 2013
at nearly 74 percent. As this group slowly begins to reach the age of 65,
the working age share is expected to continuously decline to as low as
45 percent by 2067.
The combination of the rising share of the aged population and the
falling share of the working age population inevitably affect labor force
participation, which simply measures the total labor force as a share of
the overall population. As Figure 4 shows, the labor force participation
of those 65 and over is dramatically lower than those in other younger
age categories. For example, approximately 79 percent and 77 percent
of Koreans aged between 25 to 49 and 50 to 59, respectively, were
either employed or actively looking for work in 2019. This demographics
compares to approximately 34 percent of Koreans over 65 who were
participating in the labor force. Figure 4 demonstrates that, as the
share of seniors in the population increases, Korea’s overall labor force

participation rate will certainly fall, unless a marked increase happens
in seniors’ participation in the labor force.
This dire prediction is also reflected in Figure 5, which plots the
forecasts of total labor force and its decompositions into different age
groups, conditional on the labor force participation rate of 2016 and the
projected demographic transitions. Korea’s total labor force is expected
to fall to approximately 27.4 million by 2035 and to 24.5 by 2050. On
top of this prediction, age composition of labor force is also expected to
shift toward the old age group. Whereas the size of young labor force
(below 45 years old) is likely to decrease by roughly 40 percent by the
year 2050, the share of old labor force (above 65 years old) will increase
from the current level of less than 10 percent to nearly one-fourth of the
total labor force by 2050.
The expected decline in the labor force will also influence the future
growth of real GDP. According to the growth accounting approach,
the growth in real GDP of a country can be attributed to three factors:
increases in the fraction of the labor force employed, accumulation
of physical capital, and increases in total factor productivity.
Figure 6 displays historical (1972–2010) and projected (2021–2060)
decomposition of average annual growth in real GDP into the
contributions from each of the three components mentioned above.
The results of historical decomposition support the major role
played by quantitative factors such as labor force and physical capital.

Apparently, the 70s and 80s were characterized with unprecedented
fast economic growth in Korea. Most of the real GDP growth was
attributable to the accumulation of physical capital. What should not be
overlooked is the contribution of labor force, especially during the 80s.
In the growth accounting method, qualitative gains in human capital
are incorporated into the total factor productivity growth. That being
the case, the marked contribution of the total factor productivity in the
80s was highly likely to have benefited from the labor force. As the baby
boomers with solid public education started entering the job market
in the 80s, the growth potential of the Korean economy was enhanced
by the improvement in labor force at both the quantitative and the
qualitative margins. This occurrence is typical of the phenomenon
known as the demographic dividend: when a large percentage of a
country’s population is in the working ages as a result of low fertility
and declining mortality, the working-age population benefits from a
relatively small dependent population as the size of the elderly cohort is
small, and the percentage of children is decreasing. This phenomenon
in turn allows the working-age cohort to amass savings and increase
productivity.
The situation will turn to the opposite direction in the future, or it
may already have. As the baby boomers start to retire en masse from
2021 onwards, shrinking working age population must support a large

and increasing elderly population down the road. The resulting negative
demographic dividend exhibits itself in the projections for the four
decades from 2021, where declining labor force is projected to reduce
annual GDP growth by increasing magnitudes. If the projections in
Figure 6 are transformed into the per-capita term, the results are as
shown in Table 1.
In the 2030s, the growth in the GPD per employed worker is
approximately 2 percent or higher. Given the continued decrease in the
labor force and employment caused by population aging, however, the
growth in per-capita GDP over the same period is expected to be as low

as 1.5 percent. The predicted contribution of the physical capital per
employed worker is stable at approximately 0.8 percent, reflecting that
the Korean economy is close to the steady state growth path.
Two conclusions emerge from the discussion above. First, any
future acceleration in real GDP growth will have to come from faster
productivity growth. Second, the slower growth in real GDP, resulting
from the demographic changes, will reduce the size of the Korean
economy than what has prevailed in the past with a higher rate of
population and economic growth. The reduction in economic growth
also means that the tax base for government expenditures will also
grow more slowly than in previous periods.
III. Demographic Changes and Public Spending
Conceptually, two opposite effects of population aging are identified
on the financing of government spending programs. On the one hand,
demographic shifts arising from an aging population will increase
government program spending primarily via increases in health care
spending and higher spending on income transfers to seniors. On the
other hand, an aging population can lead to decreases in government
spending associated with education and child benefit spending. In
empirics, however, extant research, such as those of MacLeod and Emes
(2017) and Robson (2010), has found that the impact of demographic
changes on the spending requirements of education and child benefits
are at most modest or unclear. We therefore concentrate on the
expected increases in public spending caused by population aging in
terms of the costs of healthcare and other welfare benefits for seniors.
A. Healthcare Costs
For elderly Korean on average to consume considerably higher levels
of healthcare services than younger cohorts is well expected, given that
higher ages are associated with higher susceptibility to illnesses and
costly chronic diseases requiring more frequent medical attention.
Data confirm this prediction. According to the National Health
Insurance Service (2019), in 2018, the latest year for which data are
available, Koreans aged 65 and above accounted for nearly 41 percent of
all health care expenditures, but they only amount to approximately 14
percent of the total population. This imbalance between the proportion
Population Aging in Korea 247
of the population over the age of 65 and the proportion of health care
spending attributed to seniors is the result of the increases in chronic
illnesses and rising ambulatory costs.
Figure 7 illustrates the average medical expenditures of different age
groups. On a per-patient basis, healthcare spending is heavily skewed
toward a patient’s earlier (birth related) and later (post 65) stages of life
after retirement. For instance, in 2018, the average per-patient medical
expenditures between the ages of 15 and 64 amounted to 1.17 million
won, whereas the average annual per-patient medical costs for those
65 and over was 4.41 million won, which is 3.8 times greater than the
15–64 average. The higher proportion of Koreans expected to be in the
category of over 65 means increasingly higher health care costs.
As the population of Korea continues to age over the next few decades
and in the absence of concurrent reforms to the healthcare system,
healthcare costs are more than likely to increase, as an increasing
portion of the population enters the age brackets with the highest
average healthcare costs. For example, a recent study by Lorenzoni
et al. (2019) predicts that Korea will be one of the countries where the
effects of demographic shifts on healthcare costs are the highest. More
specifically, the health spending per capita in Korea is then expected
to increase by 4.5 percent per year over 2015–2030, the highest rate
of increase among the member countries. Figure 8 below shows this
prediction.
Figure 9 shows the projections for the elderly healthcare costs by Lee
et al. (2015). According to this study, the total medical expenditures for

Figure 7
Healthcare Expenditure per Patient by Age Group (2018)

those aged over 65 are expected to increase up to 390.8 trillion won by
2060. This number is more than ten-tuple of that estimated for 2020
and is tantamount to 6.57 percent of GDP. Considering that the medical
expenditures by total population accounted for 8.1% of GDP in 2018,
the increase in elderly population accompanied by increases in chronic
illness and the cost of end-of-life care poses a serious challenge.3 4

more than 9 times larger than the average for surviving patient cost over the
same period.

B. Welfare Spending on Seniors
Apart from increased healthcare costs, demographic shift also
requires the government to use other resources to senior welfare
programs, such as Basic Senior Pensions, Guaranteed Minimum
Income Payment, Work Provision of Seniors, and Long-Term Senior
Nursing Insurance. As shown in Figure 10, spending (in nominal
terms) by the national government on welfare programs for the elderly
remained below 0.5 trillion won until 2007 and has increased mildly
until 2013. However, the number has been rapidly increasing since
then, as new welfare programs were introduced and exiting programs
were expanded. For fiscal year 2020, spending on these programs costs
approximately 16.8 trillion won. It represents 3.3 percent of the planned
total government spending.
Among many possible causes for such rapid increases in welfare
expenditures, the main driver is the trend of population aging caused
by low fertility rate and extended life expectancy. According to Kim and
Kim (2020)’s prediction, a one percent increase in the aging index (the
number of elders per 100 persons aged 15 or below) is estimated to rain
welfare spending for seniors by 0.12 trillion won.
Figure 11 shows how spending on elderly welfare is projected to

Figure 10
Government Spending on Senior Welfare Programs
250 SEOUL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
increase (Kim and Kim, 2020). Panel (a) plots the predicted costs for the
three major components of senior benefits, i.e., Basic Pension Program,
Health Insurance Subsidies, and Long-term Nursing Care. Over the
next three decades, spending on these key programs is projected to
increase by 3 percent every year. Panel (b) shows the projections of the
overall spending on senior welfare benefits, where total senior benefits
will increase to 680 trillion or so by 2050. This number represents
approximately 45 percent of the total government income projection for
the same year by the National Assembly Budget Office (2018).
Overall, population aging will contribute to a large increase in future
levels of government spending. In 2019, social welfare spending for
senior benefits amounted to approximately 13 trillion, accounting
for approximately 8 percent of the total government budget for social
welfare. This share is expected to increase to 12 percent and 20 percent
by 2024 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, mandatory government
spending welfare programs are projected to reach ten percent relative to
the size of the economy in 2050, an increase of approximately 4 percent
point as of 2019.
IV. Fiscal Sustainability
As widely pointed out, a rapid pace of population aging poses a
serious structural challenge to fiscal sustainability. Two channels for
future imbalances are related to demographic shifts. The first one is

Figure 11

just described above: increases in spending on healthcare and other
welfare programs for the elderly. The second is that the growth rate in
tax revenue is expected to slow down, as taxpaying working population
shrinks. These two complementary channels will create serious burden
on public finance, considering that the government’s ability to collect
tax revenue decreases due to a smaller group of taxpayers. Conversely,
the government expenditure, particularly on healthcare spending,
continuously increases.
In addition, as in many high-income countries, pension also plays a
crucial role, as important as the healthcare spending. As populations

age, the number of beneficiaries of public pension schemes will
increase, whereas the number of contributors is expected to decline
and thus resulting in deficits. Another adverse effect also comes from
a reduction in economic growth due to diminishing labor productivity.
Stagnation in economic growth will lead to a reduction in national
revenues and savings, which in turn generates negative impacts on
economic sustainability.
To illustrate the potential size of the looming fiscal imbalance,
Figure 12 plots the projected government spending and revenues by
the National Assembly Budget Office (2020) for 2020 to 2050. This
projection assumes that the details of government expenditure are
maintained as in the budget bill for 2019 and incorporates the effects of
the third supplementary budget bill in 2020.
The main takeaway from Figure 12 is the looming deterioration
in government finances. The projections indicate that the Korean
government is expected to run a shortfall in every decade of projection.
Apparently, the deficits are expected to worsen as demographic changes
place increased demands on government spending. For example, the
difference between government revenues and total expenditure in
2030 will amount to 900 trillion won. By 2050, the fiscal imbalance is
projected to be 7.8 percent of GDP or 246.5 trillion won (using 2020

Figure 13
Projected Government Debt

real GDP figures). This finding is in stark contrast to the fiscal surplus
amounting to 4.7 trillion won in 2019.
Figure 13 displays the consequences of prolonged fiscal deficit on
government debt projected by the National Assembly Budget Office
(2020), assuming that the imbalance between government spending and
revenues in Figure 12 is financed by issuing new government bonds.
According to this projection, net government debt as a percentage of
GDP is predicted to be over 75 percent of GDP in ten years now and to
reach over 131.1 percent by 2050.
One economic measure of societal aging is the old-dependency ratio
defined as the ratio of the number of elderly people aged 65 relative
to working age population, which shows how many elderly people are
supported by an economically active person. As such, this ratio is
frequently used for the economic analysis of the impact of population
aging. For example, a study by KDI (2018) finds that, among the OECD
countries where the old dependency ratio has increased by more than
10 percent point since the 1980s, a one percent increase in the ratio is
associated with a 4 percent point fall in the nominal economic growth
rate, a 0.8 percent increase in the social welfare expenditure relative to
GDP, and a 5.7 percent point increase in the ratio of government debt
to GDP.
Here, we recapitulate parts of the simulation results by Sung (2009)
using the annual macro-fiscal model of the Korean economy, which
examines the responses of key economic variables under the scenario
that the old-dependency ratio rises by 5 percent point.5 Figure 14
shows the results. Over the five years following the aging shock, labor
force decreases by 0.26 percent per annum, and the potential GDP
falls by 0.09% per annum. Owing to higher welfare spending, total
government expenditure increases by 4.5 percent per year. By contrast,
tax revenues are predicted to increase by a mere 1.9 percent per year
due to the slowdown in labor supply and growth. Consequently, fiscal
balance relative to GDP aggravates by 0.4 percent annually.
This section attempts to provide an idea of the consequences of the
fiscal imbalance down the road, but a hidden implication of increasing
debt is noted to such high levels: the effect of increased interest
5 This assumption is comparable to the actual increase in the old-dependency
ratio in the 2010s.

payments on government budgets. If the burden of interest payments
increases, the government could be forced to reduce spending in areas
such as education or other public services. To the extent that higher
levels of government debt can further lead to lower rates of economic
growth as found in some empirical studies, such as those of Woo and
Kumar (2015) and Checherita and Rother (2010), the overall impact of
aging on debt sustainability can be graver and therefore calls for more
prudent indebtedness policies.6
6 Woo and Kumar (2015) found that, for a panel of 38 countries, a ten percent
point increase in the initial debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a slowdown in
annual real per capita GDP growth of around 0.2 percentage points per year.
From a panel of 12 eurozone countries, Checherita and Rother (2010) found that
the negative growth effect of high debt starts from the levels of approximately
70% to 80% of GDP.

V. Empirical Model of Aging-Macroeconomy Nexus
A. Model and Data
In this section, we perform an empirical analysis of the link between
population aging and some key aspects of the Korean economy. The
purpose of this analysis is twofold: first, we aim at quantifying the
effects of population aging on the macroeconomy discussed in the
previous sections. Second, the results of the current analysis are
expected to serve as a guideline for extending toward other full-fledged
model for aging–macroeconomy nexus.
Following many previous studies, we adopt a VAR approach to
examine the macroeconomic effects of aging in Korea7. As discussed in
the preceding sections, aging and other macroeconomic variables have
a high tendency to be closely related and to share common long-term
trends, apart from exhibiting short-term fluctuations around those
trends. On this ground, we construct a Vector Error Correction Model
(VECM) for the Korean economy, allowing for the relationship among
the variables at both the long- and short-term time horizons.
The model we estimate is of the form
ΔYt = ΣKi
=1YiΔYt-i + αβ'Yt-1 + Ψ + εt,
where Yt is a (p×1) vector of system variables, αβ'Yt-1: a lagged error
correction term, and Ψ denotes deterministic components comprising
an intercept and dummies for the periods of economic crisis during
1997–1998 and 2008–2009.
7 As an anonymous referee has pointed out, the implications of population
aging or demographic changes are better addressed by cross-country analysis
than time-series analysis, considering that these changes exhibit long-term
effects rather than short-term dynamics. Notwithstanding, quite a few existing
studies adopt the VAR approach to investigate the macroeconomic effect of aging.
Lopreite and Mauro (2017) investigated the impact of demographic changes on
health expenditure in Italy. Doran (2012) examined the effects of fertility rates
and increases in the old-age dependency ratio on labor effort and production in
Ireland. Ferraro and Fiori (2020) assessed the effects of demographic structure
of labor force in the US on the responses of unemployment rate to marginal tax
rates.

used: the share of the population over 65 years old (AGING)8, labor
productivity measured by per capita real GDP divided by total hours
worked (PROD), per capital real GDP (RGDP), real per capita total tax
revenues (TAX), and per capita real medical expenditure (MEDEX). All
data series are obtained from the OECD Data Warehouse, except that
the series of total nominal taxes collected is obtained from NABOSTAT,
the database of the National Assembly of Budget Office. Table 2 provides
further details for the sources, construction, and transformation of data
series, and Figure 15 plots the five data series thus constructed.
8 Regarding the measure of population aging, alternative indicators such as
the old dependency ratio or life expectancy are also available. Our choice is
guided by the discussion in Yoon et al. (2014) that such alternative measures are
likely to contain the changes in demographic structure caused by forces other
than the pure aging trend. By using the elderly share among the population,
we attempt to isolate demographic shifts brought about by the trend of physical
aging only.

The precondition for fitting a VECM to data is the presence of unit
roots in individual series and cointegration among them. We first run
the ADF and KPSS tests for unit roots. Table 3 presents the results. As
foreseen in Figure 6, both tests support that all series are nonstationary
in levels and stationary in first differences.9
9 A possible exception is RGDP, for which the KPSS test rejects the null of
stationarity in its difference at the 5% significance level. However, the test fails to
reject the null at the 1% significance level. Thus, we treat RGDP as a difference
stationary series.

We then apply the Johansen cointegration test to confirm whether
a cointegration relation exists in the four data series. The results for
trace statistic and maximum eigen value statistics in Table 4 support
the null hypothesis that two cointegrating relations exist among the five
variables, based on which we use the VECM rather than the ordinary
VAR for the empirical analysis.

B. Impulse Responses
This section provides econometric evidence on the macroeconomic
effects of population aging for Korea using an estimated VECM.10 We
10 Based on the results of preliminary checks in Table 3, we use 3 lags and

identify population aging shocks by assuming a recursive ordering,
with the order of the variables in Table 3 above. Our rationale for
putting the aging variable at the top of the causal ordering is that the
aging trend is primarily a consequence of decreasing birth rates and
extending life expectancy, which are in turn driven by sociocultural
factors such as industrialization and medical technologies. Therefore,
population aging is unlikely to react contemporaneously to shocks to
other macroeconomic variables in the system. We put productivity and
medical expenses next to aging on the assumption that the first-hand
effect of aging falls on the overall quality and health of labor force. The
two latter variables then affect the level of output and then the amount
of taxes collected.
Figure 16 shows the impulse responses to a one standard-deviation
increase in the elderly share aging shock identified from our estimated
VECM. In each panel, the solid line denotes the point estimates of
responses over the horizon of 20 years. The shaded area represents the
90% confidence band obtained from a bootstrap procedure with 2,000
replications. Following its own shock, the responses of the elderly share
are significantly above zero throughout the two subsequent decades.
Panel (b) exhibits that the aging shock is associated with continued
decreases in labor productivity, although the negative response of
productivity is statistically insignificant. By contrast, the effect of a
rise in the elderly share manifests itself in the response of medical
expenditure as shown in panel (c). A positive aging shock results in
a significant increase in the per capita medical spending, even up to
20 years of horizon. Translated into tangible numbers, for example,
if the share of the elderly population increases to 14.3 percent as of
2018 to 15 percent, the extra amounts an average Korean is expected
to pay over the following 10 years sum up to 8.5 percent of that paid
in 2018. The responses of GDP in panel (d) are weak and insignificant,
in that the negative impact of aging shock on GDP is reversed in
years 10 to 13 after the shock and then turns back to the correct
sign. Still, the cumulative effects of the aging shock on GDP remain
negative throughout the forecasting horizon. Finally, panel (e) shows
the following: the adverse effect of aging is probably most conspicuous
in the responses of tax revenues, which remain significantly below
cointegration rank of 2.

consistent with and underscore the concerns about the adverse
ramifications of ongoing population aging in Korea: aggravation in

healthcare expenditures,11 and decreasing tax revenues.
VI. Concluding Remarks
As Korean population reaches old age, seniors are covering an
increasingly large share of the population, whereas the portion of people
in their working age is consequently decreasing. Consequently, labor
force participation is widely expected to decline, by which economic
growth and the foundation of collecting tax revenues are imperiled.
Concurrently, the government is faced with the need to provide health
care and other welfare programs to an increasing number of seniors.
For example, the total healthcare expenditures for those aged over 65 in
2060 are expected to increase up to 281.4 trillion won, tantamount to
5.84 percent of GDP. In addition, the overall spending on senior welfare
benefits is projected to increase to 680 trillion or so by the same year,
representing approximately 45 percent of the total government income
projection. Assuming that the details of government expenditure are
maintained as in the budget bill for 2019, this increase in spending will
contribute to a significant fiscal deficit amounting to 7.1 percent of GDP
or 237.1 trillion won (using the 2019 actual GDP figures). At this pace
of the looming fiscal imbalance, net government debt as a percentage of
GDP is predicted to be over 85 percent by 2050. In sum, the impending
demographic changes will profoundly affect government spending and
its ability to raise revenues, imperiling government finances over the
foreseeable future. The results of a VECM exercise are mostly in line
with these predictions from previous studies.
The Korean government must make a tough choice. It can simply
borrow their way through the problem and pass the buck to the
next generations, at its own risk of fiscal and sovereign debt crisis.
Otherwise, it can respond to the pressures by reforming public finance
on one hand and improving economic growth and productivity on the
other hand. The latter should aim at raising labor force participation
11 As an anonymous referee has pointed out, the expansion in welfare program
initiated in 2008 may have an impact on medical expenditure for the elderly.
Owing to the short data span, however, formally introducing a break in sample
period is not very plausible. We also believe that explicitly addressing such a
policy reform in our empirical work will produce even graver prediction of the
fiscal sustainability in the forecast periods.

of the elderly and females and encouraging investment in human
capital and R&D. Regarding the former, many countries are now
taking measures such as deferring old age pensions and encouraging
enrollment in private pension by providing tax benefits or subsidies.
As found in Lee at al. (2013) from the panel of 80 countries, responses
to population aging occur in the form of high retirement savings, high
labor force participation, and increased immigration of workers from
developing countries. Thus, a room still exists for appropriate policies
that help mitigate the adverse consequences of population changes. At
any rate, recognizing the current juncture of the looming demographic
problems affecting the government finances is the first step in search of
the right solutions.
