Sustainable agriculture encourages practices that present low risks to the environment and human health. To this
end, zein (corn protein) can be used to develop nanocarrier systems capable of improving the physicochemical
properties of biopesticides, reducing their possible toxicity. Neemoil extracted fromthe Azadirachta indica tree containsmany
active ingredients including azadirachtin, which is the active ingredient in multiple commercially available
biopesticides. In this study, we describe the preparation and characterization of neem oil-loaded zein
nanoparticles, together with evaluation of their toxicity towards nontarget organisms, using Allium cepa, soil nitrogen
cycle microbiota, and Caenorhabditis elegans aiming to achieve the safer by design strategy. The spherical nanoparticles
showed an average diameter of 278±61.5 nmand a good stability during the experiments. In the toxicity
assayswith A. cepa, the neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticlesmitigated the increase in the DNA relative damage index
caused by the neem oil. Molecular genetic analysis of the soil nitrogen cycle microbiota revealed that neem oilloaded
zein nanoparticles did not change the number of genes which encode nitrogen-fixing enzymes and
denitrifying enzymes. In C. elegans, the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles had no toxic effect,while neem oil interfered
with pharyngeal pumping and GST-4 protein expression. These neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles showed
promising results in the toxicity studies, opening perspectives for its use in crop protection in organic agriculture.

1. Introduction
Biopesticides include essential oils which are complex mixtures of
substances typically containing more than sixty volatile and lipophilic
compounds derived from secondary metabolites in plants, involving
terpenoids such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and phenols
(Campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; Chellappandian et al., 2018). Essential
oils can be extracted from the whole plant or from isolated parts in
order to obtain higher concentrations of a specific compound. Since antiquity,
essential oils have been used due to their repellent, insecticidal,
fungicidal, nematicidal, and bactericidal activities. They are considered
safer than synthetic pesticides, having been used for human consumption
and as medicines for thousands of years. They might be less toxic
to nontarget organisms, such as humans, and have low impacts in the
environment. Therefore, essential oils are a promising option for
substituting the synthetic pesticides used in agriculture (Benelli and
Pavela, 2018; de Oliveira et al., 2018a, 2018b; Ponsankar et al., 2016).
Neem oil, which is extracted from the Indian neem tree (Azadirachta
indica Juss.), is valued worldwide for use in the areas of human health
and pest control (Lokanadhan et al., n.d.). Neem oil contains N300 biologically
active compounds, with the major constituents being
triterpenes known as limonoids (Fig. 1), the most important of which
is azadirachtin (Chandramohan et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2017;
Nicoletti et al., 2012). Neem oil is effective against a wide range of
pests, exhibiting a broad spectrum of action due to its systemic and
transmembrane activities. It inhibits feeding, reduces ecdysone,motion,
and flight activity, deregulates development, suppresses fertility and reproduction,
and acts as a repellent (Campos et al., 2016). In addition,
neemoil can act as a fertilizer, improving the quality of soil for crop production,
hence contributing to sustainable organic agriculture. However,
its use in the field is limited by its short persistence in the
environment (Kumar et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2017).
The application of nanotechnology in agriculture emphasizes the
goal of the development of clean, safe, and environmentally friendly
nanomaterials, using biocompatible and nontoxic solvents, biodegradable
and biocompatible natural matrices, and energy-efficient and sustainable
processes (Ashoka et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2018; Saratale et al.,
2018). Nanocarriers are capable of increasing the solubility of active
compounds, while protecting them from volatilization and from degradation.
The improvements in efficiency can generate better results,
using lower doses and numbers of applications, hence contributing to
the reduction of both environmental contamination and risks to
human health (Campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; Choudhary et al., 2017;
Oliveira et al., 2018). Different types of nanoparticle formulations are

58 M. Pascoli et al. / Science of the Total Environment 677 (2019) 57–67
used in agriculture as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, fertilizers,
and growth regulators, among others (Pascoli et al., 2018b). The
use of polymeric nanoparticles as sustained release systems in agriculture
has shown excellent results, due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability,
and low toxicity (Campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; de Oliveira
et al., 2018a; de Oliveira et al., 2018b; Oliveira et al., 2018). Several studies
have demonstrated the potential of formulations of biopesticides associated
with polymeric nanoparticles (Campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; de
Oliveira et al., 2018a; de Oliveira et al., 2018b; Maruyama et al., 2016;
Oliveira et al., 2018; Pascoli et al., 2018a, 2018b). Zein nanoparticles
meet the requirements of environmentally friendly nanotechnology,
since zein is a naturally product that is biodegradable and biocompatible.
It represents the main protein content of corn, is composed of lipophilic
amino acid residues, and is not used for direct human
consumption, due to its negative nitrogen balance and low water solubility
(Paliwal and Palakurthi, 2014). Due to its high coating capacity,
zein is used in the production of nanocarrier systems, employing a
low toxicity solvent, such as ethanol, which is evaporated during the
synthesis, hence causing no harm to the environment when the formulation
is used in the field. Nanoparticles are capable of modifying the
properties of the active substances that encapsulated, so, it is necessary
to re-screen the material in order to ensure its safe use. This involves assays
using target and nontarget organisms, as well as evaluation of the
behaviors of newformulations in the environment, aiming at regulation
of the use of biopesticides associatedwith nanomaterials in crop protection
(Campos et al., 2018a, 2018b; Dere et al., 2015; Fraceto et al., 2016;
Pascoli et al., 2018a, 2018b; Sola et al., 2014).
Given this background, the innovation of this study was to develop
neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles. In addition to preparation and characterization
of the nanocarriers, using the novel safe by design strategy
their potential toxicity was evaluated by investigating their effects on
nontarget organisms (Allium cepa, nitrogen cycle bacteria, and
Caenorhabditis elegans). The choice was because they are model organisms,
all are used in the research of toxicity of materialsmaking possible
a broad investigation of the possible action of zein nanoparticles loaded
with neem oil, since they are in different classes of organisms (plant,
nematodes and microorganisms) that can come into contact with this
new biopesticide in the crops. The work opens perspectives for the
use of nanobiopesticides based on neem oil in crop protection, contributing
to sustainable organic agriculture aswell as improved food safety.
2. Materials andmethods
2.1. Materials
Zein and Pluronic F-68 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Neem
oil (Azamax) containing 12 g/mL of azadirachtin was acquired from
UPL Brazil. Ethanol was obtained from Labsynth. Allium cepa seeds
were purchased from Isla seeds (Brazilian company). The soil used
was obtained from a local agricultural supplier. C. elegans N2 (wild
type) and CL2166 (dvIs19 [(gst-4p::gfp::nls] III) strainswere purchased
from the Caenorhabitis Genetics Center, Minnesota, USA. Other
chemicals and solvents used were analytical grade and were purchased
from local suppliers.
2.2. Preparation of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles
Zein nanoparticles were prepared by the environmentally-friendly
antisolvent precipitation method (Hu and McClements, 2014) with
some modifications (Pascoli et al., 2018a). The antisolvent method is a
principlewhere the active compound is dissolved in a solvent; the solution
is then injected with an antisolvent solution (in which the compound
is insoluble). The compound precipitates as a consequence of
the change of supersaturation caused by mixing the solution and the
antisolvent solution. In this way, zein powder (2% w/v) was added to
an aqueous solution of ethanol (85% v/v) and kept under magnetic
stirring overnight. The zein solution was adjusted to pH 5.8, heattreated
at 75 °C for 15 min for protein densification, centrifuged, and filtered
through a 0.45 μm membrane (Millipore) to remove insoluble
particles. A 100 mg quantity of neem oil (in the form of an emulsifiable
concentrate containing 12 g/L of azadirachtin)was added to the zein solution.
An aqueous solution of Pluronic F-68 (a block-copolymer of ethylene
oxide and propylene oxide (C3H6O·C2H4O)x) extensively used as
surfactant, wetting agents and emulsifiers) (2% v/v) was prepared and
was adjusted to pH 4. The presence of Pluronic F-68 decreased the surface
tension of the nanoparticles andmaintains the stability of the nanoparticles
in suspension. Using a syringe, the zein solution was rapidly
injected into the Pluronic solution, under stirring. The resulting colloidal
dispersion was stirred for 12 h, at roomtemperature, in order to evaporate
the ethanol, and water (pH 4.0) was then added to make up the
original volume. The final concentration of neem oil in the nanoformulation
was 5 mg/mL. This concentrationwas chosen since in agriculture,
neemoil is used at concentrations of between 4 and 6mg/mL as recommended
by the manufacturer UPL Brazil.
2.3. Nanoparticle physicochemical characterization
The nanoparticle mean size distribution and polydispersity index
(an indicator of the homo/heterogeneity of the size distribution of particles
calculated by the square of the standard deviation divided by the
square of themean size)were determined by the dynamic light scattering
technique (DLS). The zeta potentialwasmeasured by the microelectrophoresis
method. These analyses were performed using a ZetaSizer
Nano ZS90 system (Malvern Instruments, UK) at a fixed angle of 90°
and 25 °C. The nanoparticle concentrations, size distributions, and
Span values (an additional parameter to show thewidth of the size distribution
calculated as Span=(D90−D10) /D50 being that D10, D50 and
D90 refer, respectively, to the diameters where 10%, 50% and 90% of the
particle population were also measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA), using a NanoSight LM 10 cell (green laserwithwavelength of
532 nm) and a sCMOS camera, controlled by NanoSight v. 3.2 software
(Grillo et al., 2012, 2014).
For these analyses, the samples were diluted 1000× in ultrapure
water and in liquid medium (0.5% saline solution), at the highest concentration
used in the C. elegans assay. Stability analyses were performed
using sample aliquots removed after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
90, and 120 min of incubation in the saline solution. Each result was
expressed as the average of three determinations.
Aliquots of zein nanoparticles and neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles
were collected and diluted in ultrapure water. Samples were
dripped onto a silicon plate AFM sampler and kept in a desiccator for
complete drying. The samples were analyzed using an Easy Scan 2
Basic BT02217 atomic force microscope (Nanosurf, Switzerland) operated
in noncontact mode with TapAl-G cantilevers (BudgetSensors,
Bulgaria) and tip voltage of 90 Hz. The acquired images were analyzed
using Gwyddion software.
2.4. Toxicity studies
2.4.1. Allium cepa assay
Based on the procedure described by de Lima et al. (2010) germinated
A. cepa seeds were exposed to the nanoformulations (zein nanoparticles,
neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles), neem oil (at a
concentration of 5 mg/mL), Pluronic F-68 surfactant, and ultrapure
water (negative control) in 10 mL glass beaker, in dark conditions for
periods of 24 h. 10 roots were exposed to each treatment. The roots
were fixed in Carnoy's reagent (methanol:acetic acid, 3:1 v/v), followed
by acid hydrolysis with 1 mol/L HCl at 60 °C during 9 min. The roots
were stained with Schiff reagent for 2 h. For preparation of the slides,
the meristematic region was crushed in one drop of 2% aceticcarmine,
using a cover slip. Three roots exposed for each treatment
were used to prepare the slides and all the cells were analyzed. This
M. Pascoli et al. / Science of the Total Environment 677 (2019) 57–67 59
assay was repeated three independent times in different days. Calculations
were made of the mitotic index (MI), the damage index (DI),
and the relative index (RI) which are indicators of the presence of cytotoxic,
mutagenic or carcinogenic potential agents in the environment.
MI was calculated by dividing the number of cells in division by the
total number of cells. DI was calculated by dividing the number of
cells showing DNA alterations during the mitosis by the total number
of cells in division. RI was calculated by dividing the values obtained
for the treatments by the values for the negative control.
2.4.2. Molecular analysis of the effects of the nanoparticles on soil
microbiota
We investigated the changes in all genes from the N cycle due the
importance of this cycle for the nitrogen fixation in soil making the
soil fertile by converting nitrogen into bioavailable forms that can be assimilated
by living beings for production of organic molecules such as
amino acids proteins and nucleic acids. Therefore, the quantification of
these functional genes involved in N transformation performed in this
work improves our understanding of N-cycling soil microbiota responses
to environmental impact (Hirsch and Mauchline, 2015; Fang
et al., 2019).
Before use, the fertilized commercial soil (14% organic matter,
pH 6.80) was sieved using a 0.2 micrometer sieve, dried and separated
into vessels with surface area of 0.025 m2 each, and kept moist in a
heated cabinet at 25 °C for 15 days. Two untreated soil samples were
used as the negative control. Each treatment (zein nanoparticles,
neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neemoil)were tested in duplicates
(two vessels containing soil for each treatment). The applications
of the formulations (using sprays) were based on the dosage and number
of applications of neemoil employed in the field (three applications
were performed on the samesample at 7-day intervals, using a 5mg/mL
solution at a dosage of 100 L/ha).
The extraction of DNA from soil microorganisms was performed 7,
14, 21, and 30 days after the first application of the treatments, using a
Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories). Quantification of
the genetic material was performed by fluorescence, using a Qubit 3.0
fluorometer with the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen). All the
samples were diluted to final concentrations of 1000 ng/mL.
Real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) were performed for
specific genes from nitrogen cycle bacteria: nifH (nitrogen fixation),
nirK, nirS, narG, cnorB, and nosZ (denitrification). The bacterial 16S
RNA gene was used as a reference. The reactions were performed
using 1 μL of DNA sample, 12.5 μL of Planium SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen), 1 μL of each primer (sense and
antisense), and sufficient ultrapure water to complete the final volume
to 25 μL. The amplifications were conducted according to a procedure
adapted from Jung et al. (2011) using a StepOne thermocycler (Applied
Biosystems),with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3min, followed by
40 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The SYBR
Green fluorescence emittedwas measured at the end of each incubation
at 72 °C.
The resultswere analyzed using relative quantification,with calculation
of ΔΔCt (2−ΔΔCt), employing 16S rRNA as the reference gene and
the initial soil as the reference sample (Yuan et al., 2008). The calculations
were performed using the StepOne Plus v2. 3 software of the
equipment.
2.4.3. Caenorhabditis elegans assays
C. elegans trains N2 (wild type, established as valuable experimental
model due to the high level of genetic homology with humans, fast life
cycle, easymaintenance and handling) and CL2166 (genetically equal to
wildtype and tagged to green fluorescent protein, GFP, fused to the promoter
of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase-4) were
maintained in plates containing NGM (nematode growth media)
enriched with salts and seeded with the bacterium E. coli OP50, at 20
°C. The fertilized nematodes were synchronized by lysing them with a
bleaching mixture (1% NaOCl, 0.25 M NaOH). The eggs obtained were
washed with M9 buffer (0.02 M KH2PO4, 0.04 M Na2HPO4, 0.08 M
NaCl, and 0.001MMgSO4) andwere kept in plates containingM9without
bacteria, during 14 h, until the larvae hatched in stage L1.
Chronic exposure of the L1 worms to the negative control (0.5%
NaCl) and the different formulations (zein nanoparticles, neem oilloaded
zein nanoparticles, and neem oil) was performed for 30 min
with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/mL of the test material, using 1500
worms per replicate (per microtube), in a liquid medium (0.5% NaCl),
with stirring to ensure contact of the nematodes with the treatments.
Concentrations were tested in duplicates, in every experiment using
C. elegans, a procedure that was repeated in three independent experiments
(in different days and different batch of worms). After exposure,
the worms were placed with the treatment on NGM plates with E. coli
OP50, and were kept at 20 °C for 48 h.
Thewild type strain nematodeswere evaluated in terms of their survival,
reproduction, body size, and pharyngeal pumping. For GST-4 enzymatic
expression, CL2166 strain that has GST-4 tagged to a GFP was
used and the labeled xenobiotic detoxification protein was determined
according to its fluorescence (Rathor et al., 2017).
For survival evaluation, 48 h after exposure a transparent grid was
placed beneath the NGM plate and 18 quadrants were analyzed under
a dissection microscope, obtaining a score according to the number of
living animals. After scoring survival, reproduction was determined by
counting the hatched larvae daily from three individual worms from
each treatment transferred to NGMplate coveredwith E. coli OP50, during
4 reproductive days. Body size was evaluated by images acquired
48 h after the exposures, using an inverted microscope (MEDILUX
MDL-INV-1) connected to a digital camera (SAMSUNG ST64). ImageJ
software was used to measure the body lengths of 10 worms per
group, in each experiment. Pharyngeal pumping was counted for
1 min using 10 worms submitted to each treatment, in order to assess
the intake of the treatments. Individuals of the CL2166 transgenic strain
were exposed to the different treatments (0.5% NaCl as negative control,
zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles and neem oil)
and were then transferred to microscope slides containing levamisole
(1 mM) as an anesthetic. Images were acquired using an
epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 50i) with a GFP filter (with
excitation at 365 nm and emission at 420 nm), and the fluorescence
was measured using ImageJ software.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Themolecular analysis of the effects of the nanoparticles on soil microbiota
and C. elegans assayswere performed in duplicate, and all other
experimentswere performed in triplicate, however, these replicates are
considered one independent experiment and were repeated at least
three times, and the data were expressed as average of three independent
experiments±standard deviations, represented by error bars. Statistical
analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v. 6 software,
using two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post-hoc test, at a significance
level of p b 0.05.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical characterization of the neem oil-loaded zein
nanoparticles
In order to characterize the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles we
have measured themean hydrodynamic diameters of the nanoparticles
dispersed in water using DLS and NTA. The results obtained by DLS and
NTA were 288 ± 6 and 198 ± 16 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A). These results
indicated that during the zein nanoparticles formation in presence
the surfactant showed a range of size as described by other authors. Wu
et al. (2012), using zein nanoparticles containing thymol and carvacrol
showed the mean size distribution by DLS in a range of 52 to 328 nm.
60 M. Pascoli et al. / Science of the Total Environment 677 (2019) 57–67
In pursuance of size distribution, using atomic force microscopy
(Fig. 2B), the results showed that the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles
were spherical, with amean diameter of 278±61 nm(with a concentration
of nanoparticles/mL of 1.13 × 1012). Using AFM, Chen et al.
(2013) observed that zein nanoparticles were spherical, with sizes of
around 100–200 nm. Cheng et al. (2019) reported the same size for
spherical zein nanoparticles containing lutein. Oliveira et al. (2018)
showed that zein nanoparticles containing geraniol and citronellal
were spherical, with smooth surfaces and mean size of 90–250 nm.
However, Fig. 2A and B showed a broad size distribution curves, indicating
that the particleswere notmonodisperse. This informationwas
confirmed by the measurement of the polydispersity index. The value
obtained for neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles was 0.313 ± 0.005.
Also, determined by NTA, the Span value calculated as described by
Bender et al. (2012) was 1.3 ± 0.005. Based on both parameters a formulation
is defined as monodisperse when the polydispersity index
and span presented values lower than 0.2 and 1 respectively. However,
in literaturewas described that nanoparticles preparedwith matrices of
natural origin (such as zein) was not monodisperse (Chuacharoen and
Sabliov, 2016; Oliveira et al., 2018).
Also, in order to investigate the stability, we have been used themicroelectrophoresis
technique tomeasure the zeta potential of neemoilloaded
zein nanoparticles. The results showed that the zeta potential of
this system was−36 ± 1 mV, which was close to the values characteristic
of a stable formulation (±30mV). Furthermore, in the case of these
zein nanoparticles, during the preparation process we used Pluronic F-
68 that provided steric hindrance, which was another factor that contributing
to the stability of the zein nanoparticles in solution
(Chuacharoen and Sabliov, 2016). Just in order to compare, negative
zeta potential values (determined by microelectrophoresis) have been
reported previously for zein nanoparticles loaded with 5-fluorouracil
(−45 ± 0.3 mV) (Lai and Guo, 2011), zein nanoparticles loaded with
thymol (from −34 to −40 mV) (Li et al., 2013), and zein nanoparticles
stabilized with carrageenan (from −40 to −50 mV) (Cheng and Jones,
2017).
Moreover as we investigated the effect of the toxicity of these particles
in models (such as C. elegans) that used salinemedium(0.5% NaCl),
the Fig. 2C showed that theymaintained the samemean hydrodynamic
size, polydispersity, and concentration during 120min (exposition time
in C. elegans), while the zeta potential decreased significantly. The zeta
potential was significantly lower in the saline environment, reaching
−7.4 mV. This decreasing in zeta potential value in the presence of saline
medium was reported in literature (de Oliveira et al., 2015; Grillo
et al., 2014, 2012; Jacques et al., 2017) and explained due the greater
ionic strength of the saline medium altered the ionic balance, leading
to changes in the nanoparticle surface charge. It is important to pointed
out that even with the low values of zeta potential (−7.4 mV) the particles
kept stable in solution, showing in thisway, the importance of the
steric hindrance of Pluronic F-68 in neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles.
3.2. Toxicity studies
3.2.1. Allium cepa chromosome aberration assay
The results obtained in the A. cepa assay (Fig. 3) showed significant
differences between the control and all treatments, for both parameters
evaluated (mitotic index and relative damage index). The treatments
with Pluronic, zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles,
and neem oil decreased the relative mitotic index (Fig. 3A). Use of the
neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles resulted in a greater decrease in
the mitotic index, compared to all other treatments. Then, our results
confirm the ability of the treatments to interfere in cell mitosis, as reported
by Kwankua et al. (2010) and Pasquoto-Stigliani et al. (2017),
that showed that neem oil extract caused a significant decrease in the
mitotic index of Allium cepa roots. The decreases in the mitotic index
caused by neem oil, together with the presence of chromosome alteration,
c-metaphase (Fig. 3B), could be attributed to the azadirachtin
ability to interfere in mitosis usually a consequence of changes in the
spindles, similar to that seen with colchicine treatment, which prevents
the formation of spindle fibers, impairing the cell cycle progress
(Soliman, 2001).
The results obtained for the relative damage index (Fig. 3C) showed
that the surfactant used in production of the zein nanocarriers caused
fewer chromosomal changes, compared to the control. For the other
treatments (zein nanoparticles, neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles,
and neem oil), the chromosomal changes were significantly increased.

software; C) mean hydrodynamic size (lines) and concentration (bars) of the
nanoparticles in saline medium (0.5% NaCl), as a function of time. The spherical
nanoparticles showed an average diameter of 278 ± 61.5 nm with no aggregates. The
nanoparticles were stable over 120 min, under the experimental conditions. Data are
expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3) and the error bars
represent the standard deviations. A significance level of p b 0.05 was adopted.
M. Pascoli et al. / Science of the Total Environment 677 (2019) 57–67 61
The zein nanoparticles and the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles
caused increases of 25% in the damage index. However, it should be
noted that neem oil alone (in the absence of nanoparticles) increased
the number of chromosomal aberrations by 200%. A similar result was
reported by Kwankua et al. (2010) who found that neem oil caused a
400% increase in chromosomal aberrations in Alliumcepa, that solidifies
our findings that indicate the zein nanoparticles are promising carriers
for neem oil, since they are able to decrease over the genotoxicity towards
nontarget organisms.
3.2.2. Effects of the nanoparticles on soil bacteria involved in the nitrogen
cycle
Soil microbiota are considered soil quality parameters once they are
responsible for regulating several important soil processes such as organic
matter decomposition, degradation of organic pollutants and
transformation of nutrients (Fang et al., 2019). The nitrogen (N) cycle
consists of several N transformation processes which are performed
by bacteria that have specific genes to encode enzymes involved in
each stage of the cycle including nifH (encoding nitrogenase reductase,
nitrogen-fixing enzyme: reduction of nitrogen gas in ammonia), amoA
(encoding ammonia monooxygenase, nitrification enzyme: conversion
of ammonia to hydroxylamine), haO (encoding hydroxylamine oxidase,
nitrification enzyme: oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite) narG
(encoding nitrate reductase, first two denitrification steps: reduction
of nitrate to nitrite) nirK and nirS (encoding Cu-containing nitrite reductase
and nitrite reductase, respectively, first two denitrification steps:
catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide), cnorB (encoding nitric
oxide reductase, second two denitrification steps: reduces nitric oxide
to nitrous oxide) and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase; second
two denitrification steps: reduction of nitrous oxide tomolecular nitrogen)
(Hirsch and Mauchline, 2015; Ouyang et al., 2018).
In this context, soil analysis should be evaluated based on control
sample that exists for each period evaluated. The percentages of nitrogen
cycle genes (Fig. 4B) show that after 7 days there is a small amount
of bacteria that present the cnorB gene, but this also presents small
amount in the control, indicating a homogeneity between the samples
and the non-alteration of the genes compared to the control (possible
observation in 5A and 5B, referring to 7 days after exposure). The results
in timeof 14 days after exposure it is possible to observe the presence of
bacteria that have the cnorB gene, being the proportions similar to those
found in control soil. The concentration of bacteria (time 14 days) presents
a greater variation in relation to the control, but the existing proportion
of each type of bacteria responsible for the maintenance of the
nitrogen cycle is similar between the treatments and the control. It is
also possible to observe an increase the nifH gene, responsible for the nitrogen
fixation, especially in control sample, and in other treatments
this still remains with a low relative quantification. After 21 days the
quantification shows that in relation to the number of genes that participate
in the cycle the treatments are matched in a smaller quantity to
control, it is possible to observe a decrease in the quantification of
cnorB and a slight increase in the amount of nirS gene, responsible for
the second step of denitrification. In the end experiment (after
30 days of exposure) the increase nosZ and cnorB genes indicates an increase
in final steps of the nitrogen cycle, being observed in all the samples
evaluated, including in control. It was possible to observe greater
homogeneity between the samples in relation to both the quantification
and the distribution have great similarity indicating that the soil, in relation
to the bacteria responsible for the nitrogen cycle do not seem to
suffer changes in the presence of the evaluated compounds.
In according to our results, Pasquoto-Stigliani et al. (2017) investigated
the behavior of bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle when

(280 mg/mL), zein nanoparticles (NP), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (Neem NP), and

average of three independent experiments (n = 3) and the error bars represent the
standard deviations. Letters a, b, c, and d indicate a significant difference relative to the
control, Pluronic, NP, and Neem NP, respectively. The significance level adoptedwas p b 0.05.
62 M. Pascoli et al. / Science of the Total Environment 677 (2019) 57–67
exposed to poly(ε-caprolactone) nanocapsules loaded with neem and
showed that the differences in the proportions of these bacteria, compared
to the control, varied during the experiment, with no significant difference
after 300 days. Maruyama et al. (2016) evaluated atrazine and
imazethapyr nanocapsules, showed lower effects on the bacterial profile
associated with the nitrogen cycle, in the soil displayed in comparison
with control. Yang et al. (2013) and Guilger et al. (2017) analyzed the effects
of silver nanoparticles on nitrogen-fixing, nitrifying, and denitrifying
bacteria, and found that the nitrifying bacteria were significantly affected,
while the nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying organisms were not.
The use ofmolecular analysis of the genes of soilmicrobiota involved
in the nitrogen cycle to investigate the possible toxicity of new materials,
especially nanoparticles, is still recent and the literature is very
limited. Further detailed studies are needed and are essential to ensure
the safe use of newly emerging technologies.
3.2.3. Effects of the formulations on the nematode C. elegans
The results of toxicity assays performed with C. elegans (Fig. 5)
showed that the survival, reproduction, and body length of the worms
did not present significant differences after exposure to the zein nanoparticles,
neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, and neem oil (using
neem oil concentrations of 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/mL). This lack
of toxicity for a nontarget organism is very promising for the advance
of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticle research. These endpoints have
been validated as the basic triad for safety assessment. Even if mortality
rate does not increase following exposure to a toxicant, the reproductive
system and the development of the worms are very sensitive and may
show tenuous signs of cellular damage (Tejeda-Benitez and Olivero-
Verbel, 2016). That because during the larval stages,mitosis andmeiosis
are in fast speed and it has been demonstrated that toxicants, pesticides
included, can disrupt cell cycle, elevate DNA double-strand break formation,
activate apoptosis and increase embryonic lethality (Shin et al.,
2019). Of note, another study evaluating the toxicity of zein nanoparticles
loaded with the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide (with an average
size of 190 nm and a surface charge of −37 mV) and showed that the
formulation exerted significant hypolipidemic activity in C. elegans,
without causing any toxic effect (Lucio et al., 2017). In contrast, nanoparticles
toxicity can be detected in this animal model. Jacques et al.
Fig. 4.Molecular analysis of the genes of bacteria associatedwith the nitrogen cycle (nifH, nosZ, cnorB, nirK, narG, andnirS). A) Relative quantification of genes by qPCR and B) proportions of
genes in the control soil and soils exposed to the zein nanoparticles (NP), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (Neem NP), and neem oil (Neem), at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after the initial
treatment. Data are expressed as average of three independent experiments (n = 3).
M. Pascoli et al. / Science of the Total Environment 677 (2019) 57–67 63
(2017) have shown that differentNPs interfered in the survival and vital
parameters of C. elegans. Solid lipid nanoparticles with or without atrazine
and simazine (sizes of 293± 3 and 288 ± 6 nm, respectively) and
polymeric nanoparticleswith orwithout atrazine (sizes of 367±13 and
305 ± 12 nm, respectively) depicted dose-dependent increases of lethality
and decreases of C. elegans body length. Chitosan/
tripolyphosphate nanoparticles, produced using a natural biopolymer,
with or without paraquat (sizes of 262 ± 14 and 246 ± 7 nm, respectively),
caused increased mortality, but did not alter reproduction or
worm length in the surviving animals, therefore providing evidences
that natural biopolymers can be more compatible to nontarget organisms
(Jacques et al., 2017). Using another nontarget organism Deng
et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2013) investigated the subacute, acute,
and subchronic toxicity of neem oil towards mice and the only significant
result was after 90 days, when the mice treated with neem oil at
a dose of 1600 mg/kg/day presented several degrees of lesions in the
testes, liver, and kidneys. However, the lesions were decreased or eliminated
after a 30-day recovery period not demonstrating critical toxicity
to the organism studied, in the same way that it happened in our research
(Wang et al., 2013).
In the presentwork, the pharyngeal pumping of theworms (Fig. 5D)
decreased significantly in the treatments with neem oil at concentrations
of 0.5 and 0.75 mg/mL, compared to the control group, while the
neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles caused no significant alterations in
the worms. Pharyngeal pumping is an indicator of a healthy worm
and is mainly controlled by cholinergic and glutamatergic innervation,
aswell as by dopamine and serotonin (Raizen, 2012). Reduced pharyngeal
pumping can lead to dietary restriction (Powolny et al., 2011). The
results suggested that the zein nanoparticle formulationwas able to decrease
the toxicity of neem oil in this organism. These findings were in
agreementwith thework of SanchesMoraes et al. (2016)who reported
the ability of polymeric nanocapsules to decrease the toxic effects of clozapine
in C. elegans.
As shown in Fig. 5E, the treatments with neem oil at all concentrations
caused significant decreases in fluorescence intensity, indicating
reduced GST-4 expression, compared to the untreated animals. The
zein nanoparticles and neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles did not affect
theGST-4 enzyme levels. GST-4 is involved in cellular detoxification and
cell defense, so the reduction induced by neem oil could lead to oxidative
stress and cell death (Lindblom and Dodd, 2006). The results
showed that the neem oil decreased GST-4 levels in C. elegans by up to
66%, compared to the control, representing a threat since this protein
is regulated by protective transcription factors, promoting longevity
and resistance to stress (Rathor et al., 2015). It should be highlighted
that the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles did not affect this parameter,
providing further evidence that the new zein nanoparticle system
was capable of reducing toxicity towards nontarget organisms (Fig. 6).
In previous studies, it has been found that treatments using extracts of
Lavandula latifolia, Melissa officinalis, Origanum vulgare (Gayoso et al.,
2018), Ginkgo biloba (Kampkotter et al., 2007) and antioxidant compounds
such as quercetin (Büchter et al., 2015) led to reduced GST-4 expression.
It should be noted that the antioxidant capacity of pure neem
oil has been demonstrated in several previous studies (Mattos et al.,
2017; Rinaldi et al., 2017; Sithisarn et al., 2005).
Fig. 5. Toxicity assay using C. elegans exposed for 48 h to 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75mg/mL of
zein nanoparticles (NP), neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles (Neem NP), and neem oil
(Neem). The wild type strain was evaluated for A) survival rate, B) brood size, C) body
length, and D) pharyngeal pumping. The transgenic CL2166 strain was evaluated for
E) fluorescence intensity, which indicates levels of GST-4 expression. The neem oil
caused decreases in pharyngeal pumping and GST-4 expression. Data are expressed as
average of three independent experiments (n = 3) normalized to % and the error bars
represent the standard deviation. Letters a, b, and c indicate a significant difference
relative to the control, NP, and Neem NP, respectively. A significance level of p b 0.05
was considered.

4. Conclusions
The neemoil-loaded zein nanoparticles developed in this work presented
good colloidal characteristics and stability in different media. In
the A. cepa analysis, the use of zein nanoparticles decreased the relative
damage index caused by neem oil. In relation to the microbiota of the
soil nitrogen cycle, the response to the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticleswas
similar to that observed for control. In tests using C. elegans, the
organism was susceptible to the effects of neem oil, while the nanoparticles
did not show potential toxicity. In this way, more studies must be
carried out to guarantee the effects of this nanopesticide before its application
in agriculture. It is therefore extremely important to recognize its
mechanisms of action (for both, nanopesticides and neem), as well as
their possible effects at the cellular level, their efficacy and their toxicity
to target organisms. A final consideration is that the definition of the
risks associated with nanobiopesticides requires amultidisciplinary approach
and that, in order to be sustainable and safe, it is crucial to ensure
the awareness and use of correct management practices between
farmers and the wider population.
