Abstract. Levy [Levy H (2016) Aging population, retirement, and risk taking. Management
Sci. 62(5):1415–1430] argues that the portfolio with the maximal geometric mean
(MGM) asymptotically dominates any other portfolio; that is, as the investment horizon
becomes very long, the MGM portfolio is preferred over any other portfolio for all
preferences with marginal utility bounded from above, U’ ≤M. The important economic
implication is that in the long run, an all-equity portfolio dominates bond (or mixed)
portfolios, which have lower geometric means. This comment shows that Levy’s result
holds only if the marginal utility is also bounded from below. This seemingly technical
correction has profound economic implications, because many commonly accepted preferences
do not satisfy the lower bound condition. Indeed, for some standard preferences, the
optimal stock–bond mix shifts toward bonds, not stocks, as the horizon increases, exactly
opposite to Levy’s conclusion.

Keywords: almost stochastic dominance • investment horizon • stocks for the long run
The analysis of Levy (2016) is based on the concept of
almost first degree stochastic dominance (AFSD), introduced
by Leshno and Levy (2002). Let F(x) and G(x)
denote the cumulative distributions of two prospects
under consideration. If F(x)≤G(x) for all x, then F
dominates G by FSD, i.e., EUF ≥EUG for all nondecreasing
utility functions (see Hanoch and Levy 1969
and Hadar and Russell 1969). The idea of AFSD is that
if F(x)≤G(x) for almost all x, but there is a small range of
“violation” where F(x) >G(x), then F is still preferred
over G for most “reasonable” utility functions. This
preference holds for all utility functions for which the
ratio inf{U’}/sup{U’} over the relevant range of possible
outcomes is not too small (see Leshno and Levy
2002 for more detail).
Levy (2016) makes the following argument: it is wellknown
that for independent and identically distributed
returns as the investment horizon T→∞ the MGM
portfolio almost surely yields a higher terminalwealth than
any other portfolio (Kelly 1956, Latané 1959, Markowitz
1976). Thus, the “violation area” converges to 0 as T→∞.
Hence, as the investment horizon becomes very large,
almost all investors will prefer the MGM portfolio.
Levy considers the case of two portfolios, F and G,
with log-normal distributions of total returns, x (x = 1 +
rate of return). Thus, log(x) is distributed normally,
with means μF and μG and standard deviations σF
and σG, respectively. μF and μG are the logarithms of
the two portfolios’ geometric means. Levy discusses
the case in which portfolio F represents an all-equity
portfolio and portfolio G represents a bond portfolio
(or a mixed portfolio with both stocks and bonds). In
this context we have μF >μG and σF > σG, because
stocks typically have a higher GM and a higher volatility
than bonds.
Figure 1 graphically illustrates the two distributions
of log(x). Panel (a) shows the two probability density
functions (pdfs), and panel (b) shows the corresponding
cumulative distribution function (cdfs), their unique
intersection point, z0, and the violation range where
F > G. As the horizon grows, the stock distribution F
moves to the right at rate μF, and the bond distributionG
moves to the right at rate μG. Thus, the distance between
the centers of the two pdfs grows linearly with the
horizon T. In contrast, the standard deviations grow
only at a rate
̅̅
T
√
. Thus, as T→∞, F almost surely yields
a higher terminal wealth than G, and the violation area
(the area where the stock cdf is above the bond cdf)
shrinks to 0. This is the intuition of the AFSD of stocks
over bonds in the long run. Let us elaborate.
The one-period normal cdfs of log(returns) cross
exactly once, at the point z0:1

For the T-period distributions the crossover point is
at the point z0(T):

Thus, z0(T) converges to either +∞ or −∞, depending
on the sign of z0. The denominator of z0 is negativee,
because σF > σG. Hence, if μF
σF > μG
σG , z0 is negative,
and z0(T) ̅̅̅→
T→∞
−∞. If μF
σF <μG
σG
, z0 is positive, and
z0(T) ̅̅̅→
T→∞
+∞. Note that z0(T) is in terms of log(returns).
In terms of the returns, x, the crossover point is
at x0(T)  ez0(T), and the two cases are: x0(T) ̅̅̅→
T→∞
0 if
μF
σF > μG
σG
, and x0(T) ̅̅̅→
T→∞
+∞ if μF
σF <μG
σG
.
These two cases have different implications for
preference dominance in the long run. To see this, let us
use Levy’s Equation (4) for the expected utility difference
between the two portfolios:
EUF −EUG 
∫x0
0
[G(x) − F(x)]U’(x)dx
+
∫∞
x0
[G(x) − F(x)]U’(x)dx ≡ I− + I+, (3)
where we define the first integral as I− and the second
integral as I+ (F and G represent the cumulative distributions
of total returns, and we are assuming,
without loss of generality, that the initial wealth is 1,
thus, the total return x is equal to the terminal wealth).
I− is the integral over the violation area, where F < G,
and it is thus negative, whereas I+ is positive.
Levy (2016) argues that as T→∞, x0(T)→0, and
therefore, if U’(x) is bounded from above by M, then
I−→0, implying that EUF >EUG; that is, stocks yield
a higher expected utility than bonds. However, notice
that this is true only in the case μF
σF
> μG
σG
. In the
case μF
σF
<μG
σG
, which is empirically more relevant, as
discussed below,we have x0(T)→∞. In this case,with
the empirical parameters the violation area still converges
to zero, and it is still true that I−→0. However,
the marginal utility U’(x) in I+ also converges to zero
for most standard utility functions. Thus, I+ may also
converge to zero, and this convergence may be faster
than the convergence to zero of the negative I−. Thus,
it is possible that EUF <EUG (i.e., bonds are preferred
to stocks in the long run).2
Levy (2016) only treats the case x0(T)→0 and ignores
the more relevant case x0(T)→∞because he uses
an erroneous formula for z0(T). Instead of the correct
Equation (2), he uses z0(T)  μF − μG
σG − σF
̅̅
T
√
(see his Equation (3),
p. 1417), which implies x0(T)→0. Levy himself does
use the correct formula for z0(T) elsewhere (see, for
example, Levy 2015, p. 179).
Levy’s argument for the MGM in the long run can be
restored if one adds a lower bound condition on U’(x),
ensuring that it does not converge to 0 “too fast”: the
stock portfolio is preferred in the long run if:
U’(x) ≥ x−β where β  1 + 1
2μF

and z0 is given by Equation (1). The proof is provided in
the appendix.
Note that several standard preferences do not satisfy
condition (4). For example, for the negative exponential
utility U(x)  −e−bx, we have U’(x)  be−bx, and this
marginal utility converges to zero faster than the power
function x−β. For the generalized power function suggested
by Samuelson (1989), and used by Levy
(2016) (Equation 7): U(x)  (x +A)1−α
1 − α , the marginal
utility is U’(x)  (x + A)−α, and condition (4) is met
for large x (where A becomes negligible) if and only
if α < β.

Notes. F represents the stock portfolio, with higher mean and higher
variance, and G represents the bond portfolio. Panel (a) shows the
probability density functions, denoted by f and g, and panel (b) shows
the cumulative distribution functions, denoted by F and G. z0 is the
unique intersection point of the cumulative distributions, given by
Equation (1). The range to the left of z0 is the “violation range”,
where F > G.

Condition (4) is sufficient but not necessary. Thus,
some utility functions may violate (4) yet still prefer
stocks in the long run. How common is the violation of
the “stocks for the long run” argument? It turns out that
for the empirical return parameters, and for some
standard preferences with marginal utility bounded
from above, bonds are indeed preferred over stocks,
even in the very long run. Figure 2 illustrates this
point. We consider two asset classes: stocks (denoted
by F), and T-Bills (denoted by G). The return distributions
are assumed to be log-normal, with the empirical
annual parameters reported in table 14.5 of Levy
(2015): μF
 0.097, σF  0.195, μG
0.034, σG 0.029.
Notice that with the empirical parameters we have
μF/σF 0.497<μG/σG  1.172; that is, we are in the
case x0(T) ̅̅̅→
T→∞
+∞. For these empirical parameters we
have β  1.505 (see Equation (4) and the Appendix). The
expected utilities of the stock and bond portfolios are
calculated numerically for various horizons, T. Panels
(a) and (b) of Figure 2 show the generalized Constant
Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function
U(x) (x+A)1−α
1−α , with parameters used in table 1 of Levy
(2016). Panel (a) shows the expected utility difference
EUF−EUG for the generalized CRRA utility function
with A = 1 and α 0.5. In this case α<β and condition (4)
is met. Indeed, the expected utility (EU) difference is
positive for large horizons T (and in this case also for
small T). Panel (b) shows the expected utility difference
EUF−EUG for the generalized CRRA utility function
with A = 1 and α 10. In this case α>β and condition (4)
does not hold. The figure reveals that the EU difference
is negative even for very long horizons; that is, bonds are
preferred. For the negative exponential utility function
U(x)  −e−b·x with b = 4, shown in panel (c), stocks are
preferred in the short run, but bonds are preferred in the
log run.

Note. In the case of the generalized CRRA utility with A = 1 and
α  0.5 (not shown), the optimal investment proportion is 100% in the
stock at all horizons.

The above analysis considers a dichotomist choice
between stocks and bonds. If diversification between
bonds and stocks is considered, how does the optimal
stock–bond mix change with the investment horizon?
Figure 3 shows the optimal investment proportion in
stocks as a function of the investment horizon (calculated
numerically). For both the exponential preference
and the generalized CRRA preference with α  10, the
optimal weight in stocks decreases, rather than increases,
with the investment horizon. This is consistent
with Levy’s (2016) own numerical analysis in his table 1
and his conclusion, “For very large and presumably
irrelevant risk aversion parameter, the optimal portfolio
tilts to a corporate bond portfolio even for very
large investment horizons” (p. 1423).3
This comment shows that maximizing the geometric
mean may not be the optimal strategy for the long run,
even if the marginal utility is bounded from above. It is
interesting to note that even though geometric mean
maximization is not generally optimal as a long-run
strategy, in the short run, when realistic borrowing
constraints are imposed, the geometric mean is more
correlated with expected utility than popular performance
measures such as the Sharpe ratio or alpha
(Levy 2017). Thus, even though the present analysis
shows that the geometric mean is not an unequivocal
criterion for fund selection for the long-run, Levy (2017)
argues that the geometric mean is nonetheless a very
useful criterion for fund selection for the short run.

Appendix
If the utility function U and return distribution parameters
are such that I+ > |I−|, then the stock (F) is preferred over the
bond (G). We show below that |I−| is bounded from above by
an expression of the formc · e−DT. Thus, I+ may also converge to
0 with T, as long as this convergence is slower than the convergence
of |I−|. A sufficient condition for this is U’(x) ≥x−β, as
shown below.

normally, and F(x)  Φ

, where Φ is the
cumulative standard normal. Note that z0  log(x0)<μF, (the
intersection of the two distributions is in the left tail) hence for
x <x0 we have log(x0) − μF < 0. For t <0, Φ(t) is bounded from
above by Φ(t) < 1
− t e− t2

Stegun 1964). Thus,

As the horizon T grows, σF grows as

T < 1, and we can replace it by 1 in the

Note that for the T-period horizon μF grows to T · μF, σF grows

where we first restrict the integral to only part of the range
(from one standard deviation in log(x) to the left of the peak
of the stock pdf until is peak) and then take the value of U’ at
the end of the range, which is the minimal value under the
assumption of risk aversion (U”≤ 0). The choice of taking one
standard deviation to the left of the mean is rather arbitrary,
as will become evident. Notice that as μF >μG, when the
horizon is long enough the pdf of G is negligible in the range
discussed, and we can approximate G ≈ 1, yielding
I+ > U’(eμF )
∫eμF
eμF − σF
[G(x) − F(x)]dx ≈ U’(eμF )
∫eμF
eμF − σF
[1 − F(x)]dx.
At the beginning of the integration range, we have 1 − F(x) 
1 −Φ( − 1)  0.84, and this decreases monotonically until the
end of the range, where we have 1 − F(x)  1 −Φ(0)  0.5.
Thus, the integral is bounded from below by 0.5 times the
length of the segment over which we integrate:
I+ > 0.5 ·U’(eμF )(eμF − eμF−σF )  0.5 ·U’(eμF )eμF (1 − e−σF ).
For the T-period horizon, we have:
I+ > 0.5 ·U’(eμF · T)eμF · T(1 − e−σF · T).
For large T, the term 1 − e−σF · Tconverges to 1 and we have:
I+ > 0.5 ·U’(eμF · T) · eμF · T.
Sufficient Condition for Preference for the Stock as T
Becomes Large
Using the above upper bound on |I−| and lower bound on I+,
a sufficient condition for I+ > |I−| is:
0.5 ·U’
(
eμF · T)
· eμF · T >ce−DT,
or
U’
(
eμF · T)
> 2ce−(D+μF)T.

Notice that the constant 2c is not relevant, as in the right

statement is that the ratio inf{U’}/sup{U’} over the relevant range of
