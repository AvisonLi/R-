Abstract
Background
As the number of older people globally increases, health systems need to be reformed to
meet the growing need for medical resources. A few previous studies reported varying
health impacts of population ageing, but they focused only on limited countries and diseases.
We comprehensively quantify the impact of population ageing on mortality for 195
countries/territories and 169 causes of death.
Methods and findings
Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017), this study derived
the total number of deaths and population size for each year from 1990 to 2017. A decomposition
method was used to attribute changes in total deaths to population growth, population
ageing, and mortality change between 1990 and each subsequent year from 1991 through
2017, for 195 countries/territories and for countries grouped by World Bank economic development
level. For countries with increases in deaths related to population ageing, we calculated
the ratio of deaths attributed to mortality change to those attributed to population
ageing. The proportion of people aged 65 years and older increased globally from 6.1% to
8.8%, and the number of global deaths increased by 9 million, between 1990 and 2017.
Compared to 1990, 12 million additional global deaths in 2017 were associated with population
ageing, corresponding to 27.9% of total global deaths. Population ageing was associated
with increases in deaths in high-, upper-middle-, and lower-middle-income countries
but not in low-income countries. The proportions of deaths attributed to population ageing in
195 countries/territories ranged from −43.9% to 117.4% for males and −30.1% to 153.5%
for females. The 2 largest contributions of population ageing to disease-specific deaths
globally between 1990 and 2017 were for ischemic heart disease (3.2 million) and stroke

(2.2 million). Population ageing was related to increases in deaths in 152 countries for
males and 159 countries for females, and decreases in deaths in 43 countries for males and
36 countries for females, between 1990 and 2017. The decreases in deaths attributed to
mortality change from 1990 to 2017 were more than the increases in deaths related to population
ageing for the whole world, as well as in 55.3% (84/152) of countries for males and
47.8% (76/159) of countries for females where population ageing was associated with
increased death burden. As the GBD 2017 does not provide variances in the estimated
death numbers, we were not able to quantify uncertainty in our attribution estimates.
Conclusions
In this study, we found that population ageing was associated with substantial changes in
numbers of deaths between 1990 and 2017, but the attributed proportion of deaths varied
widely across country income levels, countries, and causes of death. Specific preventive
and therapeutic techniques should be implemented in different countries and territories to
address the growing health needs related to population ageing, especially targeting the diseases
associated with the largest increase in number of deaths in the elderly.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Evidence on the change in number deaths related to population ageing is important for
each individual government to improve its healthcare system to address the increasing
healthcare needs of older adults.
• Previous research assessing changes in health indicators (e.g., number of deaths, mortality)
influenced by population ageing was limited to specific countries or specific
diseases.
• Quantitative methods for decomposing changes in the total number of deaths that were
adopted by previous studies are sensitive to the choice of the decomposition order of the
3 factors—population growth population ageing, and age-specific mortality rate—and
the selection of reference group.
What did the researchers do and find?
• Using a decomposition method that is not influenced by the selection of decomposition
order of the 3 factors and the choice of the reference group, we conducted a comprehensive
analysis to quantify the impact of population ageing on changes in the number of
deaths in 195 countries/territories, and for 169 causes of death, from 1990 to 2017.
• Changes in the number of deaths related to population ageing varied greatly across the
195 countries/territories; the attributed proportion ranged from −43.9% to 117.4% for
males and −30.1% to 153.5% for females.

• The causes of death for which population ageing was associated with the greatest
increases in global deaths between 1990 and 2017 were ischemic heart disease (3.2 million)
and stroke (2.2 million).
• The decreases in deaths attributed to mortality change exceeded the increases in deaths
related to population ageing between 1990 and 2017 for the whole world, as well as in
55.3% (84/152) of countries for males and 47.8% (76/159) of countries for females
where population ageing was associated with increased death burden.
What do these findings mean?
• Globally, population ageing was related to increases in deaths, highlighting the importance
and urgency of improving health systems to meet the health needs of older adults.
• Varying death burden related to population ageing suggests flexible health policies
should target the leading causes of attributed death burden in different countries/
territories.
• The death burden related to population ageing could be alleviated or even overcome
through implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce mortality.
Introduction
Largely as a result of socioeconomic development, the global population has aged rapidly in
the last few decades. The ageing population imposes a growing disease burden on the healthcare
systems of the world, especially to prevent and treat certain types of diseases and injuries.
According to a United Nations report [1], the number of people aged 65 years and older is
expected to rise from 0.7 billion (9%) worldwide in 2019 to 1.5 billion (16%) in 2050. Another
recent report suggested population ageing will be associated with a 55% increase in global disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs) among people aged 60 years and older between 2004 and
2030 [2], indicating more medical resources will be needed to meet the healthcare needs of the
elderly worldwide. Health systems in many nations will require reforms to meet this demand
based on the health impact of population ageing.
Previous studies have explored specific aspects of the health impact of population ageing
and provided policy-makers and researchers with some valuable information [3–8]. As an
example, Moran et al. projected that cardiovascular events will increase by more than 50%
between 2010 and 2030 in China as the result of population ageing and population growth [8].
However, most studies either focused on selected geographical locations (e.g., United States
[9,10] or England and Wales [11,12]), making their conclusions not generalizable, or focused
on selected diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease [8,11,13] or cancer [4,14]).Some studies did
not separate the effects of population ageing (typically approximated as changes in age structure
[3,4]) from those of population growth [8]. Without separating these effects, accurate estimation
of the net effect of population ageing cannot be assessed, and results can be misleading.
In addition, studies that estimated the net effect of population ageing adopted different decomposition
methods [4,15–17]. These traditional methods are sensitive to the decomposition
order of the 3 components (population growth, population ageing, and mortality change) as
PLOS MEDICINE Impact of population ageing on global deaths

well as to the choice of reference group [18], leading to inconsistent results across studies even
using the same data. Finally, some studies relied on questionable assumptions, such as stability
of age-specific mortality rates or incidence rates in the future [6,8].
To our knowledge, systematic analyses of the health impact of global population ageing
across a long time period are absent in the published literature, restricting international organizations
such as the World Health Organization and individual governments from making
data-driven modifications of their healthcare systems to address the increasing health needs of
the senior population. We recently developed a decomposition method that is not influenced
by decomposition order and choice of reference group [18]. We used this method to estimate
the impact of population ageing on global deaths; to assess the impact by sex, cause of death,
and country; and to assess how changes in mortality rates affected the impact of population
ageing from 1990 to 2017 globally and nationally.
Methods
Data source
All data were derived from online resources of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD
2017) [19,20]. As detailed elsewhere [15], GBD 2017 used 7 types of data sources to estimate
numbers of deaths by age, sex, and cause of death for 195 countries and territories. Multiple
strategies were adopted to impute missing data and to correct underreporting and misclassification,
including (a) reattribution of deaths with garbage codes based on the method established
by Ahern et al. [21], (b) disaggregation of causes of death that are condensed into
aggregated groups according to the invariant relative risks of death by age group compared to
a reference age group [15], and (c) noise reduction of 0 counts using a Bayesian noise reduction
algorithm [15]. GBD 2017 also estimated age- and sex-specific population sizes based on
data from 1,257 censuses and 761 population registry location-years [22].
The present study retrieved estimated numbers of deaths and population sizes by sex, age
group, cause of death, and country from 1990 to 2017 from GBD 2017. Based on income categories
defined by the World Bank in 2017 [23], we also classified the 195 countries and territories
into high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income. We
used the level 3 categorization of causes of death from GBD 2017, which includes 169 causes of
death [15]. Populations were partitioned into 20 age groups from under 5 years to 95 years and
older, with each age group spanning 5 years.
Decomposition method
Several methods have been developed to decompose differences in the total number of deaths
into contributions from 3 components: population growth, population ageing, and mortality
change [4,15–17]. Each method has pros and cons, but most are sensitive to the choice of
decomposition order and the choice of reference group, yielding inconsistent or even conflicting
results from the same data [18]. Recently, we developed a decomposition method that
overcomes these limitations by calculating the contributions of the 3 components based on the
following formulas [18]:

Details about the method are provided in S1 Text. All data analyses were performed using R
3.6.0, and the package “maps” was used to draw the maps.
Data analysis
Using the decomposition method described above, we calculated the absolute and relative contributions
of the 3 components (population growth, population ageing, and mortality change)
to the difference in number of total deaths and subgroup deaths between 1990 and each year
from 1991 to 2017 for the global population as well as for each country/territory included in
this study. The absolute contribution was the number of attributed deaths, while the relative
contribution (“attributed proportion”) was estimated as the number of attributed deaths
divided by the total number of deaths in 1990 × 100%. A positive contribution indicates an
increase in total deaths, while a negative contribution indicates a decrease in total deaths.
We plotted the absolute contributions of the 3 components to the changes in total deaths
from 1991 to 2017. The relative contributions of population ageing across the study time
period were graphed by sex for the world and for the 4 World Bank income categories. We tabulated
the 10 causes of death with the greatest increase in the number of deaths associated with
population ageing between 1990 and 2017 by sex, as well as the 10 causes of death with the
greatest decrease in number of deaths related to population ageing. We estimated country-specific
relative contributions of population ageing from 1990 to 2017 by sex and cause of death.
Last, for countries where population ageing was associated with increases in deaths between
1990 and 2017, we calculated the ratio of the number of deaths attributed to mortality change
to that attributed to population ageing (R) to assess the comparative contributions of mortality
PLOS MEDICINE Impact of population ageing on global deaths

changes (reductions in most countries) versus population ageing to changes in total deaths. R
< −1 suggests that the effect of mortality decrease in reducing the total deaths is larger than
the effect of population ageing in increasing the total deaths. R = −1 indicates that the effects of
mortality reduction and of population ageing are equal and thus offset each other, and −1 <
R < 0 suggests the effect of mortality reduction is less than that of population ageing. Finally,
R > 0 suggests changes in mortality rates and population ageing were related to increases in
deaths between 1990 and 2017. All analyses were stratified by sex because the impact of population
ageing differs between males and females [4,8].
We finalized the analysis strategies in June 2019, including exploring patterns in deaths
attributed to population ageing, variation in number of attributed deaths, and change in number
of attributed deaths across sex, country income category, and cause of death, as well as
comparing the effect of mortality change to the effect of population ageing. Data analyses were
completed June–August 2019. This research was performed and reported adhering to the
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) statement
(S1 GATHER Checklist) [24].
Results
Population ageing
According to GBD 2017 population estimates, the number of people aged 65 years and older
increased by 105% globally from 1990 (327.6 million) to 2017 (673.7 million); the number of
global deaths increased from 19.1 million to 32.2 million in the same time period (Table 1).
The proportion of people aged 65 years and older increased from 12.1% (121.5 million) to
17.5% (208.6 million), from 5.6% (119.0 million) to 10.3% (270.5 million), and from 3.9%
(75.1 million) to 5.5% (170.6 million) between 1990 and 2017 in high-, upper-middle-, and
lower-middle-income countries, respectively, but decreased from 3.2% (10.7 million) to 3.1%
(20.8 million) in low-income countries. Accordingly, the proportion of people younger than
30 years was much lower and decreased more in high-, upper-middle-, and lower-middleincome
countries (from 44.7% [447.1 million] to 35.1% [4,17.8 million], 59.5% [1,256.9 million]
to 41.5% [1,096.3 million], and 66.5% [1,282.4 million] to 58.3% [1,819.3 million], respectively)
between 1990 and 2017, compared to that in low-income countries (from 71.9% [236.8
million] to 70.6% [470.6 million]). The changes in the proportion of people aged 65 years and
older for each country/territory are shown in S1 Table.
Change in global deaths attributed to population ageing
Using 1990 as the baseline, the increase in the number of global deaths attributed to population
ageing grew gradually from 1991 to 2017 and reached 12 million in 2017 (Fig 1). Between 1990
and 2017, population growth was associated with an increase of 12 million deaths, while mortality
change (i.e., reductions in most age-specific mortality rates) was associated with a
decrease of 21 million deaths.
The proportion of deaths attributed to population change rose steadily between 1991 and
2017 for the world overall and for high-, upper-middle-, and lower-middle-income countries
(Fig 2). The attributed proportion increased more sharply in high-, upper-middle-, and lowermiddle-
income countries compared to low-income countries. These patterns were similar for
both males and females. The attributed proportion among males was 27.9% (7.0 million) for
the world and was 51.2% (2.3 million), 56.2% (4.5 million), 12.2% (1.2 million), and −7.4%
(−0.2 million) for high-, upper-middle-, lower-middle-, and low-income countries between
1990 and 2017, respectively (Fig 2A). The corresponding numbers globally and by country
income category for females were 26.0% (5.6 million), 50.6% (2.1 million), 55.6% (3.7 million),

14.0% (1.2 million), and −3.2% (−72,000), respectively (Fig 2B). The negative attributed proportion
in low-income countries results from decreases in the proportion of people aged 65
years and older (from 3.2% to 3.1%) and the fact that older adults have much higher overall
mortality rates than young people.
The impact of population ageing significantly differed across causes of death (Table 2).
Among males, across the 169 causes of death, population ageing was most significantly associated
with increases in deaths from ischemic heart disease (1.74 million), stroke (1.13 million),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.77 million), and tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer
(0.38 million) between 1990 and 2017. As an accompanying effect of population ageing, the
percentage of children in the population decreased gradually, with associated reductions of
deaths from neonatal disorders (0.39 million) and congenital birth defects (0.10 million)
between 1990 and 2017. The cause-specific decomposition results for females were roughly
similar to those for males, although the magnitudes of the contributions were somewhat lower
and the ranks slightly differ.

Change in country-specific deaths attributed to population ageing
Population ageing was associated with increases in deaths for males in 152 countries and territories
between 1990 and 2017, but decreases in deaths for males in 43 countries and territories,
primarily in Africa (Fig 3A). The latter results were the consequence of the decreased proportion
of people aged 65 years and older and the fact that older age groups have higher all-cause
mortality rates than younger age groups. The proportion of changes in male deaths associated
with population ageing between 1990 and 2017 ranged from −44% in Afghanistan to 117% in
Japan.
The geographic variation in attributed proportion for females differed moderately from
that for males (Fig 3B). Among females, population ageing was associated with increases in
deaths in 159 countries and territories, and decreases in deaths in 36 countries and territories,
between 1990 and 2017. Similar to the pattern for males, Japan had the highest attributed proportion
of female deaths (154%) and Afghanistan had the lowest (−30%).
Table 3 shows that ischemic heart disease and stroke were the 2 causes of death that were
most adversely affected by population ageing between 1990 and 2017 for both males and
females. Fourteen countries had  20% net increase in ischemic heart disease deaths attributed
to population ageing among males, and 23 countries among females. Most were high-income
countries. Two countries/territories had attributed proportions greater than 20% for strokerelated
deaths among males (Albania, 22%; South Korea, 22%), and 7 among females (South
Korea, 29%; Japan, 26%; Macedonia, 24%; Portugal, 22%; Bosnia and Herzegovina, 22%; Montenegro,
22%; and Taiwan of China, 21%) (S2 Table).
With a few exceptions, the proportion of death increase associated with population ageing
between 1990 and 2017 was less than 10% for most diseases in both sexes (Table 3). For males,
the attributed proportion was 13% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in China, 10%
for Alzheimer disease and other types of dementia in Japan, and 12% for lower respiratory
infections in Japan. The attributed proportion was greater than 10% for Alzheimer disease and
other types of dementia in 13 countries and territories for females. The attributed proportion
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 20% in Korea and 14% in China for females.
The attributed proportion for diabetes mellitus exceeded 10% in Fiji (14%), Northern Mariana

the Northern Mariana Islands (11%) had an attributed proportion greater than 10% for
females. Three countries had an attributed proportion exceeding 10% for lower respiratory
infections for females: Japan (12%), Singapore (11%), and Andorra (11%) (S2 Table).
Comparative contributions of mortality reduction versus population
ageing
Globally, the decrease in deaths attributed to mortality reduction far exceeded the increase in
deaths related to population ageing between 1990 and 2017 (−21 million versus 12 million)

(Fig 1). In fact, the ratio (R) of the decrease in deaths (a negative change) attributed to mortality
reduction to the increase in deaths (a positive change) related to population ageing between
1990 and 2017 was −1.6 for males and −1.8 for females. The ratio differed greatly across sex
and country income categories; it was −1.0, −0.8, and −3.8 for males in high-, upper-middle-,
and lower-middle-income countries, respectively, and −0.9, −1.0, and −3.7 for females in high-
, upper-middle-, and lower-middle-income countries, respectively. Because the proportion of
people aged 65 years and older decreased in most low-income countries, we did not analyze
the comparative contributions of mortality reduction versus population ageing for this
category.
Of the 152 countries that experienced an increase in male deaths related to population ageing
between 1990 and 2017, 77 countries and territories (51%) had R   −1, 66 (43%) had −1 <
R   0, and 9 (6%) had R > 0 (Guam, Jamaica, Lesotho, North Korea, Swaziland, Syria,
Ukraine, US Virgin Islands, and Uzbekistan) (Fig 4A). The lowest ratio was in Eritrea (−161),
and the highest was in Lesotho (16).
Among females, 159 (82%) countries and territories experienced an increase in deaths
attributed to population ageing between 1990 and 2017 (Fig 4B). Of these, 76 (48%) had R  
−1, 78 (49%) had −1 < R   0, and 5 (3%) had R > 0 (American Samoa, Guam, Lesotho, Serbia,
and Swaziland). The lowest ratio was in Zambia (−119), and the highest was in Lesotho (4).

Discussion
In this study, we reported on global death changes from 1990 to 2017 attributed to population
ageing for 169 causes of death both globally and by country/territory using a decomposition
method. We have 4 key findings. First, population ageing was associated with an increase of 12
million deaths worldwide between 1990 and 2017. The death increases occurred primarily in
high-, upper-middle-, and lower-middle-income countries; in fact, many low-income countries
experienced decreases in deaths attributed to population ageing. Second, between 1990
and 2017, most of the increases in deaths related to population ageing were from ischemic
heart disease (1.74 million for males and 1.47 million for females) and stroke (1.13 million for
males and 1.07 million for females). Third, the impact of population ageing greatly varied
across countries and territories, causing increases in deaths in most countries but decreases in
deaths in some countries. The country-specific impacts also differed by cause of death. Last,
the increase in deaths related to population ageing between 1990 and 2017 was outweighed by
the decrease in deaths attributed to mortality reduction both globally (−21 million versus 12

were treated as a single category. Countries with positive attributed proportions were classified into 5 categories according to
quintiles of positive attributed proportions. The maps were drawn using the R package “maps,” which was based on the data

million) and in about half of the countries and territories that experienced an increase in
deaths attributed to population ageing.
This study offers a comprehensive set of estimates concerning the health impact of population
ageing. Previous publications reported that population ageing was associated with
increases in deaths from ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular
deaths globally [17,25] and with deaths from coronary heart disease and musculoskeletal disorders
in selected countries [11,26]. Our analyses are distinct in 2 primary ways: (a) examining

global deaths attributed to population ageing for 169 causes of death across 195 countries and
territories and (b) using a decomposition method that is independent of the choice of decomposition
order and reference group, to generate more robust estimates. Consistent with previous
findings [11,17,25,26], this study demonstrates heterogeneous health impacts of
population ageing across countries. We report increased death burden in many countries but
reduced death burden in some countries (typically low-income countries/territories). The contrasting
results are likely due to different changes in the age structure of populations across
countries/territories (see Tables 1 and S1), as well as great variations in mortality rates across
age groups.
Among our notable findings is the fact that population ageing/de-ageing was associated
with decreases in deaths from some diseases (for example, ischemic heart disease) in some
low-income countries, such as Afghanistan, Liberia, and Guinea, despite being associated with
increases in deaths from these diseases globally [17]. Such results likely reflect differences in
demographic changes across nations. The proportion of people aged 65 years and older

mortality rate divided by that associated with population ageing. Blue signifies countries and territories for which the decrease in
total deaths attributed to changes in mortality was more than the increase attributed to population ageing between 1990 and
2017. Red signifies countries and territories for which the decrease in total deaths attributed to changes in mortality was less than
the increase associated with population ageing between 1990 and 2017. White signifies countries and territories not experiencing
an increase in deaths associated with population ageing between 1990 and 2017. The maps were drawn using the R package
“maps,” which was based on the data from the Natural Earth project.

increased from 12.1% to 17.5% in high-income countries but decreased from 3.2% to 3.1% in
low-income countries between 1990 and 2017 [20]. Thus, population ageing/de-ageing was
associated with varying health impacts across countries and territories. International organizations
and national governments should weigh these variations when developing and implementing
action plans to improve health, or tailoring prevention programs to face the potential
health impact from population ageing in particular regions and countries.
A key strength of this study was our use of a decomposition method that functions independently
of the choice of decomposition order and reference group to comprehensively estimate
the health impact of population ageing from 1990 to 2017 for the whole world as well as for
195 individual countries/territories. We considered both all-cause mortality and cause-specific
mortality for 169 causes of death. Our decomposition results can be compared across countries/
territories and across causes of death, regardless of decomposition order of the factors
and the choice of reference group. In addition, we evaluated the extent to which changes in
mortality rate alleviated or exceeded the increases in deaths related to population ageing,
exploring the importance of prevention efforts to reduce age-specific mortality.
This study has several limitations. First, our results depend on the quality of the estimates
for the numbers of deaths and population sizes from GBD 2017. They are therefore affected by
factors that impact the accuracy of the GBD 2017 estimates, including lack of high-quality
mortality and migration data for some countries and lack of widely validated estimation methods
[15,22]. Second, we cannot provide 95% confidence intervals for our estimates because we
are unable to access the full posterior samples of cause-specific mortality rates stratified by age,
sex, location, and year from the GBD 2017 study [5,15,22]. Third, population ageing can be
caused both by decreasing fertility rates and by increasing life expectancy [2,27]. The method
used in this study does not explore the 2 mechanisms of population ageing. Fourth, the
method used in this study only considers 3 factors, and thus ignores any heterogeneity underlying
other factors related to changes in total mortality. For example, temporal changes in age
structure or mortality rates may vary by sex or income level. We conducted analyses specific to
each subpopulation defined by sex, country income level, and cause of death and thus partially
accounted for such heterogeneity. These limitations could be overcome through methodological
innovations and improving data quality in future research.
This study offers valuable data and insights to guide health policy-making and reform of
health systems, especially in countries experiencing rapid population ageing such as South
Korea, Japan, and China. Our results demonstrate the success and promise of disease prevention
and health promotion efforts. Encouragingly, the increase in deaths related to population
ageing was outweighed by the decrease in deaths attributed to mortality rate reductions
between 1990 and 2017. This was true both globally and in about half the countries and territories
studied. The challenges brought about to society through population ageing can therefore
be substantially alleviated through disease prevention and health promotion. Despite an ageing
global population, mortality rates worldwide are decreasing [8]. To maintain these successes,
health resources should be allocated to further reduce mortality rates in countries/territories
where the effect of population ageing much outweighed that of mortality reduction, as illuminated
by our findings. As lower income countries experience economic, infrastructure, and
public health improvements, they may face challenges from population ageing similar to the
challenges higher income nations are now confronting. They should benefit from the lessons
learned in higher income countries, and should invest in proven interventions to promote
healthy ageing [28–30]. As an example, scholars have highlighted the successful efforts of Canada
in promoting active, healthy ageing through strategies such as collaborating with various
stakeholders to advocate physical activity, and have argued that these efforts could readily be
adapted and disseminated in sub-Saharan African countries [28]. Our results help identify

countries with successful experiences, especially those with reduced age-specific mortality outweighing
population ageing, in shaping the long-term pattern of death burden.
Conclusions
This study identified a global pattern of increased disease-related deaths attributed to population
ageing from 1990 to 2017. Because of heterogeneity in age structure and age-specific mortality
rates, the impact of population ageing on deaths varied by sex, country income level,
country, and cause of death. The increase in deaths related to population ageing was largely
offset by mortality reductions both globally and in about half of individual countries and territories.
To respond to the increase in deaths related to population ageing for some causes of
death, policy-makers should invest more in preventive medicine, ageing-related health
research, and implementation of proven cost-effective interventions against chronic diseases
and injuries.
