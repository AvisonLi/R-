The GH/IGF-I axis influences many aspects of salmonid life history and is involved in a variety of physiological
processes that are related to somatic growth (e.g., reproduction, smoltification, and the response to fasting and
stress). As such, fisheries studies utilize GH/IGF-I axis components as indicators of growth and metabolic status.
This study established time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIAs) for rainbow trout plasma GH and IGF-I
using commercially available reagents. For the GH TR-FIA, the ED80 and ED20 were 0.6 and 28.1 ng/mL, the
minimum detection limit was 0.2 ng/mL, and the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV) were
4.1% and 13.4%, respectively. Ethanol remaining from acid-ethanol cryoprecipitation (AEC) of plasma samples
to remove IGF binding proteins reduced binding and increased variability in the IGF-I TR-FIA. Drying down and
reconstituting extracted samples restored binding and reduced variability. The extraction efficiency of IGF-I
standards through AEC, drying down, and reconstitution did not vary over the working range of the assay. For
the IGF-I TR-FIA, the ED80 and ED20 were 0.2 and 6.5 ng/mL, the minimum detection limit was 0.03 ng/mL, and
the intra- and inter-assay %CV were 3.0% and 6.5%, respectively. Biological validation was provided by GH
injection and fasting studies in rainbow trout. Intraperitoneal injection with bovine GH increased plasma IGF-I
levels. Four weeks of fasting decreased body weight, increased plasma GH levels, and decreased plasma IGF-I
levels. The GH and IGF-I TR-FIAs established herein provide a cost-comparable, non-radioisotopic method for
quantifying salmonid plasma GH and IGF-I using commercially available reagents.
1. Introduction
In fishes, as in other vertebrates, the growth hormone (GH)/insulinlike
growth factor-I (IGFeI) axis is the major endocrine system regulating
growth, indicating strong evolutionary conservation across taxa
(Bergan-Roller and Sheridan, 2018; Reindl and Sheridan, 2012). Indeed,
mammalian and salmonid data are in agreement on all key aspects
of the GH/IGF-I axis (Bjornsson, 1997; Bjornsson et al., 2018).
The GH receptor is found in most tissues, with the highest density located
in the liver (Bjornsson et al., 2002; Reindl and Sheridan, 2012).
GH can thus stimulate tissue growth directly, but also does so indirectly
through GH-induced production and release of IGF-I from the liver
(Daughaday and Rotwein, 1989). In mammals and fishes alike, IGF-I
acts via autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanisms to mediate the
growth promoting actions of GH as well as acting as a negative feedback
signal on GH secretion from the pituitary (Duan, 1998; Perez-
Sanchez and Le Bail, 1999; Perez-Sanchez et al., 1992; Tannenbaum,
1993; Wood et al., 2005). The effects of both local and circulating IGF-I
are modulated by a complex suite of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs)
(Duan and Xu, 2005; Shimizu and Dickhoff, 2017).
It is not surprising then, that nutritional status is the primary environmental
regulator of the GH/IGF-I axis – that is, growth must adjust
according to nutritional conditions and, as the primary regulator of
growth, this means that nutritional state will affect the GH/IGF-I axis
(Duan, 1998; Moriyama et al., 2000; Pierce et al., 2001; Thissen et al.,
1999). During fasting, growth ceases, and energy is mobilized from
storage tissues to support metabolism and maintain homeostasis (Bar,
2014; Navarro and Gutierrez, 1995). These effects are mediated in part
by changes in the GH/IGF-I axis. Fasting normally leads to increased
plasma GH levels while IGF-I levels decrease, an endocrine condition
known as acquired GH resistance (Jenkins and Ross, 1996; Thissen
et al., 1994; Thissen et al., 1999). In fasted fish, changes in GH/IGF-I
axis hormones are part of an adaptive response; low IGF-I suppresses
growth and high GH stimulates lipolysis, thereby directing available
nutrients to the physiological functions necessary for survival while
also gaining access to energy reserves. This response is important in

T
survival in the natural environment, as most fish undergo periods of
fasting throughout their life history, while others, such as salmonids,
undergo prolonged periods of fasting while migrating long distances
(Bar, 2014; Mommsen, 2004; Navarro and Gutierrez, 1995). Thus,
plasma GH and IGF-I levels can be used as indicators of nutritional
status.
The GH/IGF-I axis interacts with other physiological systems, particularly
those that regulate life history transitions. In salmonids, GH
and IGF-I increase during smoltification, the suite of physiological,
morphological, and behavioral changes that occur before migration to
saltwater (McCormick, 2012). The GH/IGF-I axis interacts with the
reproductive endocrine axis in the regulation of the initiation of puberty
and other aspects of reproductive development in teleosts
(Taranger et al., 2010). For example, the decision in salmonids to mature
is believed to be linked to growth and lipid reserves several months
prior to developmental changes in the gonad (Larsen et al., 2006;
Medeiros et al., 2018; Silverstein et al., 1998; Thorpe, 2007). This is
likely a consequence of the fact that maturation depends on parameters
related to growth and metabolism, such as size, energy reserves, and
growth rate, at a specific stage (“critical period”) several months prior
to histological indications of gonadal development (Taranger et al.,
2010; Thorpe, 2007; Thorpe et al., 1998). Thus, the GH/IGF-I axis plays
a role in the major life history transitions that define salmonid life
histories. Due to these interactions, as well as the role of the GH/IGF-I
axis in the regulation of growth and metabolism, GH/IGF-I axis components
show promise for use as indicators in fisheries and aquaculture
studies. Plasma IGF-I is a well-established indicator of growth rate
(Beckman, 2011; Perez-Sanchez et al., 2018; Picha et al., 2008; Pierce
et al., 2001), although, as reviewed by Beckman (2011), the correlation
between IGF-I and growth ranges from reliable to non-discernable, reflecting
the effects of a range of endogenous and exogenous factors on
the GH/IGF-I axis. The complex and changeable suite of IGFBPs present
in fish plasma interferes in IGF-I assays, resulting in a requirement for
an extraction procedure to remove IGFBPs before assay (Shimizu 1999,
Shimizu 2000, Shimizu 2006, Plisetskaya, 1998). Although less explored,
GH also shows promise as an indicator of catabolic status during
the extended periods of reduced feeding and growth that occur
throughout the life histories of many fish (Picha et al., 2008; Pierce
et al., 2005).
Understanding the life histories, growth, and metabolic status of
wild and cultured salmonids is important in the management of salmonid
populations. Measurement of GH/IGF-I axis components can
provide insight in all of these areas. Time-resolved fluorimmunoassays
(TR-FIAs) for GH and IGF-I enable measurement of protein hormone
levels while avoiding the safety, regulatory, and radiolabel decay issues
associated with radioimmunoassays. However, to our knowledge, no
TR-FIA has yet been established for salmonid GH, and no existing TRFIA
for detecting plasma GH in fish is composed of commercially
available reagents (Fukuda et al., 2015). Moreover, current protocols
for IGF-I TR-FIAs require beginning the assay directly after completing
the binding protein extraction procedure (Small and Peterson, 2005;
Hevroy et al., 2013), which complicates the workflow and introduces
high levels of ethanol remaining from extraction into the TR-FIA, resulting
in suboptimal binding conditions. Therefore, the aims of this
study were to establish and validate TR-FIA assays to detect GH and
IGF-I in salmonid plasma, and to modify IGFBP extraction protocols to
remove ethanol and allow storage of samples between the extraction
and assay procedures. In addition, existing IGF-I assay protocols were
modified to increase sensitivity. Biological validation was provided by
GH injection and fasting studies in rainbow trout.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fish
Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) used in this study were
acquired from a breeding population at the Aquaculture Research
Institute (ARI) at the University of Idaho (Moscow, ID, USA) and cared
for according to the ARI's standard operating procedure as described by
Medeiros et al. (2016). All fish rearing and sampling procedures followed
guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of Idaho.
2.2. Peptide, hormone, and antibody sources
Recombinant barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and tuna (Thunnus maccoyii)
IGF-I as well as recombinant black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri)
GH were purchased from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). Polyclonal
rabbit anti-barramundi (L. calcarifer) IGF-I and anti-salmon/trout
(genus Oncorhynchus) GH were also purchased from GroPep (Adelaide,
Australia). Custom recombinant rainbow trout GH (gh1, GenBank
Accession no. P09538.2) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) IGF-I
were purchased from Prospec (New Brunswick, NJ). Both the IGF-I and
GH antibodies have been used previously, and the specificity tested and
confirmed (Dyer et al., 2004; Le Bail et al., 1991; Shimizu et al., 2000;
Small and Peterson, 2005). Native bovine GH (bGH) was purchased
from US Biologicals (Salem, MA).
2.3. Peptide and hormone labeling
Europium (Eu)-labeled GH and IGF-I (Eu-GH and Eu-IGF-I, respectively)
were prepared by PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA) via labeling of
recombinant barramundi IGF-I and recombinant rainbow trout GH with
DELFIA® Eu-N1 ITC lanthanide chelate (Ref 1244–302, PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA). Initial labeling of IGF-I under conditions favoring only
N-terminal attachment of the europium chelate failed; therefore, this
condition was relaxed.
2.4. Pituitary homogenate
For demonstration of competitive binding, a crude pituitary
homogenate from rainbow trout was prepared by homogenizing 10
whole pituitaries in 1 mL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8)
containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 5 min. The
solution was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g
at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge
tube and considered to be at a concentration of 1 ×.
2.5. TR-FIA for GH
The assay was performed in goat anti-rabbit-coated yellow 96-well
plates (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and run over the course of 4 days,
with 3 overnight incubations. The standard curve consisted of 8 serially
diluted points, ranging from 500 to 0.03 ng/mL, with 4-fold dilutions.
On the first day, the 96-well plate was washed 5× with 300 μL of
Delfia® wash solution (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) per well before
adding Delfia® assay buffer (DAB; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and
20 μL of the rabbit anti-salmon/trout GH polyclonal antiserum (diluted
1:5000; GroPep, Adelaide, Australia). The non-specific binding (NSB)
wells received 165 μL of DAB while the maximum binding (B0), standard
curve, and unknown sample wells received 145 μL of DAB plus
20 μL of the primary antibody. The plate was then sealed and incubated
for 24 h at 4 °C with constant slow shaking on an orbital plate shaker
(VWR, Radnor, PA). On the second day, the plate was washed 5× with
300 μL of Delfia® wash solution per well and the standard curve and
unknown samples were plated. Both the NSB and B0 wells received
165 μL of DAB. The standard curve was generated by adding 125 μL of a
known recombinant barramundi IGF-I concentration and 40 μL of DAB.
The unknown plasma samples were determined by adding 125 μL of
plasma diluted as necessary in DAB and 40 μL of DAB. The standard
curve was run in duplicate and unknowns in triplicate. The plate was
then sealed and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with constant slow shaking

on an orbital plate shaker. On day 3, the plate was not washed and
20 μL of Eu-GH (diluted to 25 ng/mL with DAB) was added to all wells
except the blank and total count (TC) wells. The plate was then sealed
and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with constant slow shaking on an orbital
plate shaker. On the fourth and final day, the plate was washed 5×
with 300 μL of Delfia® wash solution per well. 200 μL of Delfia® enhancement
solution was added to all wells, and 5 μL of the Eu-GH label
(made up the previous day) was added to the TC wells. The plate was
then sealed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with moderate
shaking on an orbital plate shaker, and the time resolved fluorescence
was measured with a Victor™ X4 Multilabel Plate Reader
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) using the Europium program. Briefly, the
well is pulsed 1000 times per second with an excitation light of 340 nm,
in the period between flashes the sample fluorescence is measured
(europium fluoresces at 615 nm) for 400 μs after a delay time of 400 μs.
Assay calculations were conducted as follows, using average fluorescence
counts for replicate wells. The value for the blank wells was
subtracted from all wells, and then the NSB value was subtracted from
remaining wells. The B0 (maximum binding) was calculated and standards
and unknowns (B) expressed as %B0 ((B/B0) × 100). The standard
curve was generated by plotting %B0 against known IGF-I concentrations
on a linear y-axis and a log x-axis and fitting a curve using a
four-parameter-logistic equation. Unknown sample values were interpolated
from the standard curve; samples with percent binding values
above 80% and below 20% were re-assayed. The total counts (TC) value
was multiplied by 4 in order to account for the difference in label volume
added to the total count well versus what was added to the sample
wells. Percent total counts was calculated as (B0/TC) × 100. The
minimum detection limit of the assay was calculated using the mean
count of the zero standard minus two standard deviations, expressed as
B/B0, and used to interpolate a value from the standard curve (Shimizu
et al., 2006).
2.6. TR-FIA for IGF-I
2.6.1. IGF-I acid-ethanol-cryoprecipitation extraction procedure
The procedure was modified from Daughaday et al. (1980) and
Shimizu et al. (2000) to remove ethanol and enable storage of extracted
samples. Briefly, 125 μL of blood plasma was acidified with acidethanol
(87.5% 200 proof ethanol and 12.5% 2 N HCl, at a ratio of 1,4
v:v). The solution was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature
for 30 min. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at
1860 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was decanted into a
fresh tube and neutralized with 0.855 M Tris base at a ratio of 5:2 v:v,
respectively. The samples were again thoroughly mixed and incubated
at −20 °C for one hour, and then centrifuged at 1860 × g for 30 min.
The resulting supernatant was decanted into a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube, the amount decanted was noted, and then the sample
was dried under vacuum for 4 h. Samples were reconstituted in nanopure
water at the same volume that was transferred following the final
centrifugation, vortexed thoroughly, and incubated in a water bath set
at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples used in the extraction comparison assays
were made up from recombinant barramundi IGF-I. The extracted and
dried down samples followed the protocol outlined above, whereas the
extracted samples followed the protocol up until the final centrifugation,
and then the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and assayed
immediately. The AEB standard curve samples were made up in
neutralized extraction buffer but not subject to the extraction procedure.
To account for the dilution factor inherent to this extraction
process, the standard curve was prepared at 7-times the normal concentration.
In both extraction procedures, the entire standard curve was
prepared and then extracted. The extracted samples were run in triplicate.
2.6.2. TR-FIA for IGF-I
The IGF-I time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) protocol was
based on Small and Peterson (2005) and Hevroy et al. (2013) with
modifications. The incubation timing, volumes, and time resolved
fluorescence detection employed in the IGF-I assay were identical to
those in the GH assay. The standard curve consisted of 8 serially diluted
points, ranging from 400 to 0.024 ng/mL, with 4-fold dilutions. The
rabbit anti-barramundi IGF-I polyclonal antiserum was diluted 1:1500
(GroPep, Adelaide, Australia). The Eu-IGF-I label was diluted to 50 ng/
mL. Unknowns were extracted and dried down plasma reconstituted in
nanopure water as described above and diluted as necessary in DAB.
Assay calculations and interpolation of unknowns were conducted as
described for the GH assay.
2.7. In vivo experiments
2.7.1. IP injection experiment
To determine if exogenous GH increases plasma IGF-I in rainbow
trout, twenty fish were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with either vehicle
or vehicle containing bGH. While under anesthetic, fish were IP
injected with either 1 μL vehicle × g fish−1 (vehicle fish
[145.3 ± 13.2 g, n = 10]) or with vehicle plus bGH at a dose of 2.5 μg
bGH × 1 μL × g fish−1 (bGH-injected fish [140.7 ± 9.8 g, n = 7]).
The vehicle was sterile-filtered 0.9% NaCl containing 0.1% BSA. At
t = 12 h, fish were lethally sampled, and a blood sample collected (see
section 2.8 Sampling Procedures below). Fish were held in 595 L circular
tanks under a simulated normal photoperiod. Tanks were supplied
with 17–18 °C well water by a recirculating system that was composed
of a bubble bead mechanical and biological filter and u-shaped settling
basin. Flow rate was approximately 11 L min−1. Fish were fasted for the
duration of the experiment.
2.7.2. Fasting experiment
An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of fasting on the
GH/IGF-I axis in rainbow trout. For the duration of the experiment, fish
were held in 1130 L circular tanks under a simulated normal photoperiod.
Tanks were supplied with 10 °C water by a recirculating system
that was composed of a chiller, settling pool, sand filter, a UV treatment,
and a biological filter. Flow rate was approximately 14 L min−1.
Fish were fed to satiation 5 days a week with a standard commercial
trout diet (5.5 mm pellets; Skretting USA, Tooele, UT). At the onset of
the experiment, 22 fish with an average mass of 686.3 ± 25.6 g were
split into two groups (n = 11 per treatment). The control group (Fed)
continued to be fed as described above, while the other group (Fasted)
was fasted for the duration of the experiment. Fish were individually
identified with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags inserted into
the body cavity (Biomark, Inc., Boise, ID). On March 20th, 2019
(4 weeks after the start of the experiment), all fish were lethally sampled
(see Sampling Procedures below).
2.8. Sampling procedures
Lethal sampling consisted of recording (1) the PIT tag code, (2) total
body weight and length and (3) collecting a blood sample. Briefly, fish
were anesthetised in MS-222 (0.1 g l−1; Western Chemical, Ferndale,
WA) and blood sampled from caudal vessels using a 23G needle attached
to a 1 mL syringe coated with heparin (10 mg/mL; Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g
for 10 min, the plasma aspirated and frozen immediately on dry ice.
Plasma samples were stored at −80 °C until laboratory analysis.
2.9. Statistical analyses
The experimental data were analyzed using Prism 8.2 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Plasma hormone concentrations were
subjected to unpaired t-tests. Plasma parallelism was objectively evaluated
by comparing hillslope values between individual curves and the
standard curve for the respective assay using nonlinear regression

analysis evaluated over the usable portion (20 to 80% of maximum
binding) of the standard curve. For all analyses, the level of significance
was evaluated at P ≤ .05, and values are expressed as the average ±
the standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).
3. Results
Eu-GH was labeled at a ratio of 7.6 europium chelate molecules per
molecule of GH protein. At the label concentration employed, this gave
approximately 120,000 counts per 20 μL. The primary antibody bound
approximately 20% of the label in the B0 wells at the concentration
employed. Specific binding of the europium-labeled GH was displaced
by increasing amounts of unlabeled GH (Fig. 1). Serial dilutions of pituitary
homogenate (Fig. 1a) and blood plasma (Fig. 1b) from rainbow
trout were parallel to the standard curve (p = .67 and 0.43, respectively).
The ED80 and ED20 were 0.58 ± 0.06 ng/mL (n = 8) and
28.1 ± 1.1 ng/mL (n = 8), respectively. The minimum detection limit
of the assay was 0.22 ± 0.08 ng/mL (n = 8). The intra- and interassay
coefficients of variation were 4.1% and 13.4%, respectively
(n = 23). Interspecies specificity of the primary antibody was tested by
running a serial dilution of recombinant black bream GH, which was
found to be not parallel to the standard curve (data not shown;
p < .05). During development and validation, it was discovered that
the assay required at least a 2-fold dilution of plasma prior to assay.
This was deduced from observations that plasma run neat yielded %B
below 20%, but when the same sample was diluted 2- to 10-fold the
results implied that the neat value should have been within the 20 to
80% binding range.
Eu-IGF-I was labeled at a ratio of 2.3 europium chelate molecules
per molecule of IGF-I protein. At the label concentration employed in
this study, this resulted in approximately 95,000 counts per 20 μL. The
primary antibody bound approximately 25% of the label in the B0 wells
at the primary antibody concentration employed. Specific binding of
the europium-labeled IGF-I was displaced by increasing amounts of
unlabeled IGF-I and serial dilutions of blood plasma from rainbow trout
were parallel to the standard curve (Fig. 2; p =.83). The ED80 and ED20
were 0.23 ± 0.02 ng/mL (n = 8) and 6.5 ± 0.4 ng/mL (n = 8),
respectively. The minimum detection limit of the assay was
0.028 ± 0.008 ng/mL (n = 8). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients
of variation were 3.0% and 6.5%, respectively (n = 7). Interspecies
specificity of the primary antibody was further tested by running serial
dilutions of recombinant tuna and gilthead seabream IGF-I, which were
found to be parallel to the standard curve (data not shown; p = .22 and
0.97, respectively).
Maximum binding was reduced from near 100% to approximately
80% of B0 in extracted standard curves or curves made up in neutralized
acid/ethanol buffer versus the neat standard curve (Fig. 3; top
parameter values from curve fit equation were significantly different,
Fig. 1. Displacement curves for recombinant rainbow trout GH assay standards,
serially diluted rainbow trout pituitary homogenate (a), and serially diluted
rainbow trout blood plasma (b). Serial dilutions of pituitary homogenate and
blood plasma from rainbow trout were parallel to the standard curve (p = .67
and 0.43, respectively).

from rainbow trout were parallel to the standard curve (Fig. 2; p = .83).

have been extracted and run using the extraction and TR-FIA procedures outlined
in this study (black symbols and lines) compared to the displacement

and run using the unmodified extraction protocol (gray symbols and lines),
which does not remove the ethanol from the assay. Maximum binding was
significantly reduced in curves containing neutralized acid/ethanol buffer when
compared to curves produced using the modified extraction protocol (top
parameter values from curve fit equation were significantly different, p < .05).

p < .05). Increased variability between replicates was also evident in
curves containing extraction buffers. A similar reduction in percent B0
and increase in variability between replicates was found when ethanol
at the final concentration in neutralized extract (50%) was added to B0
wells. Additionally, the reduction in percent B0 and increase in variability
decreased with decreasing ethanol concentration (data not
shown). The reduction in percent B0 and increased variability were
eliminated when the standard curve was dried down after extraction
and reconstituted. Curves reconstituted in ddH20 were more similar to
the neat standard curve than when reconstituted in DAB (data not
shown). Based on a comparison of the extracted and dried down versus
neat standard curves, the recovery of IGF-I after extraction, drying
down, and reconstitution was 80% (based on values interpolated from
20, 50, and 80% binding), and recovery was similar across the working
range of the assay. Based on these results, samples were dried down and
resuspended in ddH20 after extraction before being run in the TR-FIA
IGF-I assay.
Using the TR-FIA, the response of circulating IGF-I to IP injection
with bGH was examined in rainbow trout. Twelve hours post-injection,
fish injected with bGH experienced a nearly two-fold increase in plasma
IGF-I levels when compared to fish injected with vehicle alone
(p < .01, Fig. 4).
Following a four-week period of fasting, fasted fish weighed significantly
less than the fed treatment group (p < .001), which corresponded
to a 12.5% decrease in weight compared to their initial weight
versus the 14.2% increase that the fed group experienced (Fig. 5). This
expected decrease in weight was accompanied by a significant increase
in plasma GH levels (p < .01, Fig. 6a) and a significant decrease in
plasma IGF-I levels (p < .01, Fig. 6b).
4. Discussion
The present study developed and validated a TR-FIA for rainbow
trout GH. This study also established modifications to the standard IGF
binding protein extraction procedure, and validated modifications to an
existing TR-FIA IGF-I for use in rainbow trout, resulting in an improved
assay and more efficient workflow. The assays, including the modification
to the extraction procedure, are intended to target the physiological
range for plasma GH and IGF-I observed in salmonid species.
As with other TR-FIAs, these assays provide a cost-effective, convenient
alternative to radioimmunoassays (RIAs) that provide comparable
sensitivity. Additionally, as the recombinant rainbow trout GH is
available for purchase through Prospec, all components of the TR-FIAs
are commercially available to any interested party with the laboratory
resources to perform TR-FIAs. Availability of these assays will enable
investigation of the role of the GH/IGF-I axis in studies on the life
history, growth, reproduction, and response to environmental stressors
in rainbow trout and other salmonids, which are species of cultural,
conservation, economic, and recreational importance.
The GH utilized in this study was a custom recombinant hormone
constructed based on the rainbow trout gh1 sequence, that demonstrated
similar displacement to native GHs employed by other studies
(Le Bail et al., 1991; Wilkinson et al., 2006). This implies that the labeling
process does not appear to have affected its ability to bind to the

antiserum. Plasma parallelism tests indicate that the GH TR-FIA can be
used to detect GH in rainbow trout blood plasma, but it does require a
small dilution. This is probably the result of plasma matrix interference
due to the high ratio of sample to total well volume (125 μL in 165 μL
total) added on the second day of the assay and remaining after addition
of the label (20 μL) on the third day. This study found that a 2-fold
dilution was enough to ameliorate the effects of the matrix interference
in adult rainbow trout. A dilution series is therefore recommended for
future studies to prevent matrix interference. The sensitivity of the GH
TR-FIA was sufficient to measure plasma GH levels in rainbow trout
after the 2-fold dilution, and was similar to the sensitivity of RIAs (Le
Bail et al., 1991; Wilkinson et al., 2006) taking the dilution into account.
Considering the quantification limits of GH RIAs validated for
use in salmonids, this GH TR-FIA provides a safe, convenient, and costcomparable
alternative to traditional RIAs.
Specific binding proteins have been identified and characterized for
both GH (GHBP) and IGF-I, which modulate their physiological effects
(Duan and Xu, 2005; Wood et al., 2005). More information exists regarding
the function and regulation of IGFBPs (reviewed by Duan and
Xu, 2005) than that for GHBPs (Baumann, 2002; Fisker, 2006). The vast
majority (approximately 99.7%) of IGF-I circulates bound to high affinity
IGFBPs, which interfere in IGF-I assays, thus plasma IGF-I should
not be quantified without first removing IGFBPs with a specific extraction
procedure (Shimizu et al., 1999; Shimizu et al., 2000). In
contrast, extraction procedures for GHBPs are not employed in salmonid
GH assays due to lower amounts of GH bound to specific GHBPs
(Bjornsson et al., 1994; Le Bail et al., 1991; Sohm et al., 1998;
Wilkinson et al., 2006). In the present study, it was determined that the
ethanol remaining from the standard acid-ethanol cryoprecipitation
(AEC) IGFBP extraction method developed by Shimizu et al. (2000)
reduced maximum binding to approximately 80% of B0 and increased
variability between replicates in the IGF-I TR-FIA. The effect of ethanol
on the IGF-I TR-FIA is likely worse than in IGF-I RIAs because the
proportion of extracted sample in the reaction volume is higher (125 of
165 μL in TR-FIA vs 10 of 160 μL or 36 of 350 μL in RIA). Therefore,
ethanol was removed by drying down and reconstituting samples,
which restored binding and reduced variability. This modification has
the additional benefits of separating the days on which the samples are
extracted and run in the TR-FIA (since samples in AEC extraction buffers
cannot be stored) and enables concentration of samples.
In the current study, IGF-I extraction efficiency (including drying
down and reconstitution) was calculated by interpolating the values at
20, 50, and 80% binding from an unextracted standard curve and also
from a standard curve that had been extracted, dried down, and reconstituted,
and then comparing the values. The extraction efficiency
was found to be between 78 and 80% at all three points, implying that
the loss is not concentration dependent. The loss of immunoreactive
IGF-I is likely due to protein damage from exposure to low pH and
ethanol during the extraction procedure, adsorption to surfaces, and
precipitation in the pellet. The loss is probably less in fish plasma
samples due to the protective nature of the plasma matrix, and thus the
80% value represents a minimal extraction efficiency. Fish IGF-I RIA
and TR-FIA procedures do not include correction for extraction efficiency
because this factor in fish plasma is not known (Ferriss et al.,
2014; Hevroy et al., 2013; Shimizu et al., 2000; Small and Peterson,
2005). To provide results comparable to existing studies, we do not
propose to correct IGF-I values measured with the present IGF-I extraction
procedures and TR-RIA for extraction efficiency.
Extracted and reconstituted rainbow trout blood plasma and reconstituted
recombinant tuna and sea bream IGF-I diluted in parallel
with the IGF-I standard curve in the TR-FIA. This indicates that the
assay is valid for use in rainbow trout and suggests that it will work in
other fish species as well. These results were expected based on previous
assays utilizing the same antibody (Dyer et al., 2004; Shimizu
et al., 2000; Small and Peterson, 2005). Initial trials followed an established
IGF-I TR-FIA protocol with addition of the primary antibody,
standards/unknowns, and label on the first day, followed by a single
overnight incubation (Small and Peterson, 2005). However, this was
found to result in poor assay sensitivity (data not shown). Simultaneous
incubation of the main assay reactants could result in loss of standards/
unknowns and label in the following wash step. Therefore, the addition
of reagents was separated, with overnight incubations between each
step, similar to RIA protocols. This modification decreased the
minimum detectable level by approximately 7-fold compared to other
TR-FIAs for IGF-I. So, while the present TR-FIA requires a longer
timeframe to complete it is provides improved sensitivity compared to
other TR-FIAs and a reliably accurate, highly sensitive, convenient, and
cost-effective alternative to RIA for IGF-I.
Biological validation of the IGF-I TR-FIA and the modifications to
the IGFBP extraction procedure was provided by a GH injection study
using rainbow trout. GH is a major positive regulator of liver IGF-I
production, and increases circulating IGF-I under fed conditions
(Bergan-Roller and Sheridan, 2018; Moriyama et al., 2000; Reindl and
Sheridan, 2012; Wood et al., 2005). A sample collected 12 h post-injection
confirmed that bGH elicited a significant increase in circulating
levels of IGF-I, in agreement with previous studies in rainbow trout
(Biga et al., 2005). This result confirms that the IGFBP extraction procedure
and IGF-I assay can measure physiologically relevant changes in
plasma IGF-I in rainbow trout. Biological validation of both assays and
the extraction procedure was provided by a fasting study. Although GH
stimulates liver IGF-I production and increases circulating IGF-I in fed
animals, the situation is different during fasting. In general, for fish and
mammals alike, fasting increases blood plasma GH (Bjornsson et al.,
2018; Duan and Plisetskaya, 1993; Pierce et al., 2005; Small and
Peterson, 2005) while at the same time blood plasma IGF-I is reduced
(Bjornsson et al., 2018; Cohick and Clemmons, 1994; Moriyama et al.,
1994; Pierce et al., 2001; Pierce et al., 2005). To determine whether
these changes could be detected using the new assays, we conducted a
4-week fasting experiment using mature rainbow trout. As expected,
over the course of the 4-week period, the body mass of the control fish
increased whereas fasted fish experienced a decrease in body mass.
After 4 weeks of fasting plasma GH was significantly increased and
plasma IGF-I significantly reduced compared to controls. This provides
evidence that physiologically relevant changes in plasma GH and IGF-I
can be measured using these assays and the extraction procedure.
Although expected, the results of the present study add to the body
of evidence on regulation of the GH/IGF-I axis in fishes. The increase in
plasma IGF-I after GH injection adds to the many studies showing that
GH is the major positive regulator of circulating IGF-I in the fed state.
However, during fasting, a metabolic state termed acquired GH resistance
develops, in which the liver becomes resistant to stimulation of
IGF-I production by GH (Kelley et al., 2000). GH resistance appears to
be due to both liver receptor downregulation and inhibition of postreceptor
signaling pathways (Gray et al., 1990; Perez-Sanchez et al.,
1995; Perez-Sanchez et al., 2018; Thissen et al., 1999). The resulting
decrease in circulating IGF-I is thought to lead to increases in pituitary
GH secretion via relaxation of negative feedback (Blaise et al., 1995;
Fruchtman et al., 2000; Perez-Sanchez et al., 1992; Yamashita and
Melmed, 1986). The pattern of increased GH and reduced IGF-I in response
to fasting found in the present study is consistent with this
model. This is believed to be an adaptive response of GH to nutritional
conditions requiring catabolism of body tissues to support metabolism;
GH's growth-promoting role is turned off and its lipolytic, energy mobilizing
role is turned on (Bergan-Roller and Sheridan, 2018; Perez-
Sanchez et al., 2018; Reindl and Sheridan, 2012).
Because of the central importance of the GH/IGF-I axis in both
growth and energy mobilization, GH/IGF-I axis components can be
used as indicators of growth and nutritional or metabolic status in
fisheries and aquaculture studies. In addition, the GH/IGF-I axis interacts
with other physiological systems, particularly those that regulate
life history transitions linked to growth. Thus, quantification of plasma
GH and IGF-I levels provides considerable insight into the physiological
