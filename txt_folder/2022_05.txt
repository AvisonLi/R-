Disrelation mapping was applied to Raman imaging data for the first time to investigate submolecularlevel
variations that occurred at the interface between glass fiber (GF) and polypropylene (PP). Disrelation
maps constructed with Raman spectra provided spatial as well as spectral information, which are not
readily accessible from hypercubic data. For example, patterns that appeared in the disrelation maps
showed the predominant development of a long helix band (1002 cm1) at the interface between the
GF and PP, rather than a short helix band (974 cm1). The development of the disrelation intensity
was observed inside the sample as well as at the surface. These results clearly reveal that the GF or compatibilizer
works intrinsically as a nucleating agent to induce additional development of the crystalline
structure of the PP, which eventually makes the polymer system harder but more brittle.

1. Introduction
Application of disrelation map to Raman imaging data is
described in this study. Spectroscopic imaging is a technique for
probing the molecular structure of each chemical functional group
in an observed spatial region of a sample. The two most commonly
used types of spectral microscopy are infrared (IR) and Raman
imaging [1–4]. We have recently reported a data analysis technique
called disrelation mapping, which is useful for studying
spectroscopic imaging data [5–11]. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation
of disrelation mapping. Spectral microscopy collects a series
of spectra in a systematic manner as a function of the spatial coordinates
of the image. The data thus obtained forms a hypercube
structure consisting of two spatial variables and one spectral variable.
Disrelation mapping constructs a correlation map based on a
two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis applied to each element
of an image with its local neighbor [12,13]. An image constructed
by using this scheme represents the dissimilarities among spectra

selected from the localized planar sampling space. For instance, the
disrelation intensity becomes significant only in spatial regions
that have physical or chemical changes reflected in the spectra.
Consequently, a disrelation map can highlight the regions where
specific interactions occur between components.
This technique has already been successfully applied to IR imaging
data to probe molecular interactions in nanocomposites or
polymer blends, as well as the state of water molecules in mammalian
cells [5–8]. In this study, the application of disrelation mapping
is extended to the Raman microscopic study of a polymer
composite system consisting of polypropylene (PP) and glass fiber
(GF) to probe the submolecular-level change that occurs at the
interface between a filler and a polymer matrix [14–16]. In a modern
confocal Raman microscope, a laser source illuminates the
sample. The excitation light source is focused on a specific area
using an objective. A confocal Raman microscope provides high
spatial resolution and the ability to examine depth profiles by utilizing
a precision motorized XYZ stage [1,2,17]. This approach is
often referred to as ‘‘optical sectioning” in contrast to the approach
that involves mechanically cutting a cross-section and scanning
across it laterally. Thus, Raman imaging has a definite advantage
in that it selectively probes a specific area inside a sample compared
with transmittance or attenuated total reflection (ATR) measurement
by IR spectroscopy. In addition to its lateral surface, the
interior of the dumbbell-shaped PP/GF specimen was examined
with Raman imaging. Disrelation maps derived from the Raman
spectra were also compared with a map obtained with ATR-IR
imaging to demonstrate the potential of disrelation mapping analysis
combined with confocal Raman microscopy.
2. Methods
Assume an m-by-n spectral data matrix A, comprising m spectra
with n spectral variables selected by using a local window
within the full spectral image. A set of dynamic spectra A is derived
by subtracting the average spectrum. The synchronous correlation
(i.e. covariance) spectrum U is obtained as [12,13]
U ¼ 1

where /ij indicates the ith row and jth column element of the
synchronous correlation matrix defined by Eq. (1). A disrelation
spectrum Kij represents dissimilar variations in spectral intensities
at the ith and jth spectral variables appearing in the spatial region
defined by the local window [5]. A new value for the center pixel in
the local window is obtained as a disrelation spectrum Kij. The
window is moved across the entire plane of the image, and finally
generates a new image based on the disrelation intensity. The disrelation
intensity develops only if the spectral intensities at the ith
and jth spectral variables within the local spatial area vary out-ofphase
with each other and not simultaneously. In other words, the
disrelation intensity becomes significant only in regions where
chemically or physically meaningful variations take place. Hence,
this technique became an effective localized highlighting tool with
which to pinpoint the region of interest within a vast spectral
dataset.
3. Experimental
3.1. Preparation of PP/GF composite
Homo-PP and GF were supplied by Prime Polymer and Asahi
Fiber Glass, respectively. The diameter of the GF is approximately
10 lm. Polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) purchased
from Sanyo Chemical was used as a compatibilizer. The
PP and PP-g-MA were mixed with a dispersion mixer (Nihon Spindle
Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) at 50 rpm in a mixing chamber heated
to 220 C. Once the PP and PP-g-MA were sufficiently plasticized,
the GF was fed into the mixture and additional mixing was
employed for 10 min at 50 rpm. The blending ratio of the PP, GF
and PP-g-MA was 69/30/1. The mixture was then pelletized, and
the pellets were molded with a tabletop injection molding
machine, Mold Lock (Century Innovation). Approximately 10 g of
the pellets were heated to 240 C and injected at 5 mL/s and
6 MPa into a mold to form a dumbbell-shaped specimen defined
by the ISO 8256 method [18]. Dumbbell-shaped specimens of the
neat PP were also prepared in a similar manner.
3.2. Tensile testing
Stress–strain curves of the PP/GF and neat PP samples were
measured by a multi-purpose stretching tester (EZ-LX, Shimadzu)
at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min at room temperature (ca. 25 C).
3.3. IR microscopy
A set of FT-IR spectra of the PP/GF sample were collected with a
TENSOR II spectrometer (Bruker) coupled with a Hyperion 3000
microscope equipped with a 64  64 focal plane array detector.
ATR-IR spectra were collected at a spectral resolution of 4 cm1
with the coaddition of 1024 scans over a region of 3800–
500 cm1 by probing a 32 lm  32 lm region with a pixel resolution
of 0.5 lm.
3.4. Raman microscopy
Raman mapping data were collected with an XploRA confocal
Raman microscope (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser as
an excitation light source. The incident laser with a power of 3.7
mW was circularly polarized and focused through a
100  objective (NA = 0.9). The scattered light was collected
through the same objective. Raman lateral (XY-plane) and depth
(YZ-plane) maps were acquired at a spectral resolution of < 3 cm1
over a 2000–100 cm1 wavenumber region by probing a
20 lm  30 lm region and a 30 lm  10 lm region with pixel resolutions
of 1.0 lm  0.5 lm (XY-plane) and 0.5 lm  1.0 lm (YZplane),
respectively.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Mechanical property of PP/GF composite
Fig. 2 shows stress–strain curves of the neat PP and PP/GF composite
samples. The neat PP sample exhibits a gradual increase in
strain at the onset of the deformation, representing the elastic
deformation of the PP. Further elongation of the sample leads to
its plastic deformation. The occurrence of the different deformation
behaviors is mostly associated with the coexistence of the rubbery
amorphous and rigid crystalline structures in the PP sample.
On the other hand, the PP/GF sample exhibits a steep increase in
stress, and this eventually leads to a sudden fracture without the
appearance of any obvious plastic deformation. Although such
variations in mechanical property caused by the incorporation of
GF are commonly considered to be related to the presence of the
GF, which substantially restricts the mechanical displacement of
the system, there is also a need to provide an in-depth understanding
of the phenomena. For example, it is known that an interfacial
interaction between the filler and the matrix in a composite system
often offers the components firm link to improve mechanical property
[14–16]. Thus, spectroscopic imaging may provide an additional
opportunity to examine the molecular-level variations
around the interface between the components. In fact, the development
of a latent interaction between the GF and PP can be readily
identified by IR and Raman disrelation maps as shown later.
4.2. IR imaging of lateral surface area
We first examine IR imaging data for the PP/GF composite as a
reference for later comparison with disrelation maps derived from
the Raman data. Fig. 3(A) shows a visible image of the lateral surface
area scanned with IR microscopy. The bright and dark colored
domains in Fig. 3(A) represent the GF and PP, respectively. Fig. 3(B)
shows IR spectra extracted from the region indicated by the white
arrow in Fig. 3(A). While PP develops several bands in this IR
region, importantly there are no specific IR bands that can be
assigned to the ‘pure’ crystalline or amorphous structure of PP
[19–22]. There are so-called regularity bands arising from the helical
structures of PP, which are essential to crystal formation. For
example, the peak appearing at 973 cm1 in Fig. 3(B) can be
assigned to a shorter helix, which are abundant in an amorphous
component [22]. On the other hand, the band observed at
998 cm1 can be assigned to a longer helix predominantly present
in a crystalline component [22]. Although these IR bands are simply
a reflection of the number of helical turns, their intensity variations
can be used as an empirical inference to identify the changes
in the crystalline and amorphous contents. For instance, the presence
of the very large surface of the GF often substantially lowers
the surface free energy barrier for nucleation and then increases
the frequency of the spontaneous nucleation of the PP crystals. This
interaction eventually induces the additional development of the
crystalline structure of polymer especially around the interface
between the PP and GF. Thus, the intensity variations of the regularity
bands may provide key information when it comes to examining
the possible generation of their surface interaction, which
plays an important role in improving the mechanical property of
a nanocomposite sample. But the variation in the regularity bands
of the PP is dominated by the overwhelming contribution from the
Si-O-Si group of the GF, making it difficult to identify the pertinent
difference between the intensity variations of the regularity bands
[23].
Fortunately, there is a way to selectively attenuate the signal
contribution from a specific peak by using a pre-treatment technique
called null-space projection (NSP). NSP is a method for selectively
removing a specific signal contribution from spectra by
sorting dynamic spectra into two separate sets: one of which is

fully aligned with a chosen projecting vector while the other is
orthogonal to the same vector [24–28]. For example, Fig. 3(C)
shows NSP-treated spectra calculated with the spectra shown in
Fig. 3(B) by using the spectral intensities at 955 cm1 as a projecting
vector which represents the IR absorption by the GF. The spectra
are now free from the intensity change related to the projection
vector while the spectral intensities can be both positive and negative
after the projection treatment. Namely, the NSP-corrected
spectra remain contributions from all other constituents except
for the GF. The variation in the spectral feature in Fig. 3(C) indicates
that, when we move from region A to region B, we encounter a
gradual increase in the PP bands. Such a pattern indeed agrees with
the fact that PP is more abundant in region B than in region A. Thus,
the application of disrelation mapping to the NSP-corrected spectra
makes it possible to obtain pertinent information without being
hampered by the exceptionally dominant contribution of the GF
component.
Fig. 4 shows (A) synchronous and (B) asynchronous correlation
spectra calculated with the NSP-corrected IR spectra shown in
Fig. 3(C). The cross peak appearing at the (998, 973) coordinate
in the synchronous correlation spectrum indicates a simultaneous
change in the spectral intensities of the long helix band (998 cm1)
and short helix band (973 cm1), reflecting the fact that both the
intensities of these PP bands are increasing simultaneously in
Fig. 3(C). One noteworthy observation here is the development of
a pair of cross correlation peaks in the asynchronous correlation
spectrum (Fig. 4(B)). For example, the positive cross peak at the
(998, 973) coordinate in Fig. 4(B) reveals that the IR intensity at
998 cm1 occurs predominantly before that at 973 cm1 when
we look from region A to region B. This sequence implies that
the increases in the long helix and short helix do not happen coincidentally.
In other words, the cross peaks suggest the presence in
this system of a specific region where the crystalline structure
develops greatly. Fig. 4(C) shows a disrelation map constructed
with the intensities at 998 and 973 cm1 of the NSP-corrected IR
spectra selected with 5  5 local window. The disrelation intensity
values in the figure are already normalized to the [01] range for
convenience. The two parallel lines indicated with bright colors
in Fig. 4(C) shows the region developing a strong disrelation intensity
between the long and short helix bands. In other words, the
pattern reveals specific regions where a crystalline structure dominantly
developed. Interestingly, such regions apparently correspond
to the boundary between the GF and PP as shown in Fig. 3
(A). This observation implies that the development of the disrelation
intensity between the long and short helix bands becomes
especially acute when the PP and GF are brought together. It is thus
most likely that the GF must be present for the development of the
additional crystalline structure of the PP. It is also important to
point out that only a pair of parallel lines indicating GF/PP interfaces
is identified in the disrelation map although several fibers
are clearly visualized in Fig. 3(A) as relatively bright areas. Such
pattern can be explained if one assumes that not all the fibers
are exactly on the surface of the object. Some fibers observed in
the visible image may be covered with relatively thin PP layer
which makes it impossible to detect the signals from the GF by
the ATR measurement, although such thin PP layer is not readily
identified by the visible inspection.
4.3. Raman imaging of lateral surface area
It is now instructive to compare the IR disrelation map with
those derived from Raman imaging data to demonstrate the potential
of the Raman disrelation map. Fig. 5(A) and (B), respectively,
are a visible image of the PP/GF sample and Raman spectra collected
from the surface area indicated by the white window seen
in Fig. 5(A). It is noted that regularity bands are also observable
in this Raman region [29]. Peaks at 974 and 1002 cm1 are attributed
to the short helix and long helix, which are essential to the
amorphous and crystalline structures of PP, respectively. Hence,
the correlation analysis of these Raman bands can also provide pertinent
information associated with additional growth of the crystalline
structure.
Fig. 6 shows (A) a disrelation spectrum calculated with the
Raman spectral data shown in Fig. 5(B) and (B) a disrelation map
constructed with the Raman intensities at 1002 and 974 cm1,
respectively. The spectra were subjected to offset baseline collection
prior to the application of the 2D correlation analysis. It is
noted that the disrelation spectrum develops a distinct correlation
peak at (1002, 974), which indicates the dissimilar intensity variations
of the short and long helix bands within the observed area.
Again, the result suggests the presence of a specific spatial area
where the crystalline structure develops greatly in this system.
Another interesting observation here is the development of a pair
of disrelation peaks in the Raman band around 974 cm1. Unfortunately
the origin of these peaks is not clear at this moment, it is

the NSP-corrected IR spectra shown in Fig. 3(C). (C) A disrelation map constructed

clear that the emergence of the cross peaks reveals that the Raman
band around 974 cm1 is essentially consisting of two peaks showing
different intensity change within the spatial area. So the pair of
disrelation peaks may indicate the bands each having different
helix length. A disrelation map constructed with the Raman intensities
at 1002 and 974 cm1 by using 5  5 window size is shown in
Fig. 6(B). Two parallel lines with significant disrelation intensity
are generated in the horizontal direction, indicating the greatly
developed crystalline structure at the interface between the GF
and PP. The length of the perpendicular segment between them
agrees well with the actual size of the GF observed in Fig. 5(A).
Consequently, the pattern appearing in the disrelation map represents
the crystalline structure of the PP generated by the surface
interaction between the GF and PP. A possible cause of the additional
crystalline growth induced by the GF may be explained if
we assume that the GF essentially works as a nucleating agent to
cause the additional development of the PP crystalline structure
by lowering the surface energy barrier [30,31]. Another possibility
is due to the nucleating of the PP by the compatibilizer concentrated
at the interface.
It is now interesting to note that the IR and Raman disrelation
mapping analyses were carried out independently but they eventually
provided somewhat similar results indicating the additional
crystalline growth around at the boundary between the GF and PP.
It is likely that disrelation mapping can be effectively utilized for
Raman as well as IR imaging analysis.
4.4. Raman imaging of depth profile
So far, we have examined the IR and Raman spectra collected at
the surface of a PP/GF composite by disrelation mapping. While the
Raman spectra collected at the lateral surface area of the sample
eventually provided information somewhat similar to that derived
from the IR spectra, a disrelation map based on Raman spectra displays
interesting potential when it is applied to the depth-resolved
Raman spectra. For example, Fig. 7(A) shows the visible image of
the PP/GF sample and Fig. 7(B) shows depth-resolved Raman spectra
collected along the white bar shown in Fig. 7(A). The Raman
spectra in Fig. 7(B) again generate regularity bands, which indicate
the presence of different helix structures in the probed area. Hence,

spectra collected inside the white window indicated in Fig. 5(A).

the detailed analysis of intensity variations associated with these
regularity bands provides pertinent information related to inside
the sample.
Fig. 8 (A) shows a disrelation spectrum calculated with the
depth-resolved Raman spectral data of the PP/GF sample. Of note
is that the disrelation spectrum develops a correlation peak at
the (1002, 974) coordinate in Fig. 8(A). This disrelation intensity
implies that the distribution of the long helix component is substantially
different from that of the short helix component inside
the sample. The details of the differences between the distributions
are clearly visualized by a subsequent analysis based on disrelation
mapping. For example, Fig. 8(B) shows a disrelation map constructed
with Raman intensities at 1002 and 974 cm-1of the
depth-resolved Raman spectra by using 5  5 window size. It
should be noted that semi-ellipse shape indicated by a significant
level of disrelation intensity can be observed in the disrelation
map to reveal the area where the crystalline structure develops
greatly inside the sample. This characteristic pattern can be
explained if we assume a nucleating effect induced at the interface
between the GF and PP. Actually, this observation agrees well with
the fact that the length of the minor axis of the semi-ellipse is
approximately 10 lm, which corresponds to the fiber diameter of
the GF. The result again suggests a possible interfacial interaction
between the GF and PP, which cannot be readily identified with
conventional analysis based on mechanical testing. Disrelation
mapping thus provides an additional opportunity for optical sectioning
based on confocal Raman microscopy by highlighting the
feature associated with the chemical interaction between the
components.
5. Conclusion
Confocal Raman microscopy provides intrinsically very rich
information for studying both molecular structure and spatial distribution
inside sample. However, it is not always easy to derive
pertinent information from the Raman imaging data due to the
complexity of the hypercubic data structure. The present study
has demonstrated the potential of disrelation mapping for exploring
complicated Raman imaging data. Sets of Raman spectra of a
PP/GF composite were disentangled by disrelation mapping. The
disrelation maps showed the additional development of the long
helix band induced particularly at the interface between the GF
and PP, indicating the nucleating effect induced by the GF or compatibilizer.
Such predominant crystalline growth was observed
around the GF inside the sample as well as that appearing at the
surface of the sample.

Disrelation mapping was applied to Raman imaging data for the first time to investigate submolecularlevel
variations that occurred at the interface between glass fiber (GF) and polypropylene (PP). Disrelation
maps constructed with Raman spectra provided spatial as well as spectral information, which are not
readily accessible from hypercubic data. For example, patterns that appeared in the disrelation maps
showed the predominant development of a long helix band (1002 cm1) at the interface between the
GF and PP, rather than a short helix band (974 cm1). The development of the disrelation intensity
was observed inside the sample as well as at the surface. These results clearly reveal that the GF or compatibilizer
works intrinsically as a nucleating agent to induce additional development of the crystalline
structure of the PP, which eventually makes the polymer system harder but more brittle.

1. Introduction
Application of disrelation map to Raman imaging data is
described in this study. Spectroscopic imaging is a technique for
probing the molecular structure of each chemical functional group
in an observed spatial region of a sample. The two most commonly
used types of spectral microscopy are infrared (IR) and Raman
imaging [1–4]. We have recently reported a data analysis technique
called disrelation mapping, which is useful for studying
spectroscopic imaging data [5–11]. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation
of disrelation mapping. Spectral microscopy collects a series
of spectra in a systematic manner as a function of the spatial coordinates
of the image. The data thus obtained forms a hypercube
structure consisting of two spatial variables and one spectral variable.
Disrelation mapping constructs a correlation map based on a
two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis applied to each element
of an image with its local neighbor [12,13]. An image constructed
by using this scheme represents the dissimilarities among spectra

selected from the localized planar sampling space. For instance, the
disrelation intensity becomes significant only in spatial regions
that have physical or chemical changes reflected in the spectra.
Consequently, a disrelation map can highlight the regions where
specific interactions occur between components.
This technique has already been successfully applied to IR imaging
data to probe molecular interactions in nanocomposites or
polymer blends, as well as the state of water molecules in mammalian
cells [5–8]. In this study, the application of disrelation mapping
is extended to the Raman microscopic study of a polymer
composite system consisting of polypropylene (PP) and glass fiber
(GF) to probe the submolecular-level change that occurs at the
interface between a filler and a polymer matrix [14–16]. In a modern
confocal Raman microscope, a laser source illuminates the
sample. The excitation light source is focused on a specific area
using an objective. A confocal Raman microscope provides high
spatial resolution and the ability to examine depth profiles by utilizing
a precision motorized XYZ stage [1,2,17]. This approach is
often referred to as ‘‘optical sectioning” in contrast to the approach
that involves mechanically cutting a cross-section and scanning
across it laterally. Thus, Raman imaging has a definite advantage
in that it selectively probes a specific area inside a sample compared
with transmittance or attenuated total reflection (ATR) measurement
by IR spectroscopy. In addition to its lateral surface, the
interior of the dumbbell-shaped PP/GF specimen was examined
with Raman imaging. Disrelation maps derived from the Raman
spectra were also compared with a map obtained with ATR-IR
imaging to demonstrate the potential of disrelation mapping analysis
combined with confocal Raman microscopy.
2. Methods
Assume an m-by-n spectral data matrix A, comprising m spectra
with n spectral variables selected by using a local window
within the full spectral image. A set of dynamic spectra A is derived
by subtracting the average spectrum. The synchronous correlation
(i.e. covariance) spectrum U is obtained as [12,13]
U ¼ 1
m 1

where /ij indicates the ith row and jth column element of the
synchronous correlation matrix defined by Eq. (1). A disrelation
spectrum Kij represents dissimilar variations in spectral intensities
at the ith and jth spectral variables appearing in the spatial region
defined by the local window [5]. A new value for the center pixel in
the local window is obtained as a disrelation spectrum Kij. The
window is moved across the entire plane of the image, and finally
generates a new image based on the disrelation intensity. The disrelation
intensity develops only if the spectral intensities at the ith
and jth spectral variables within the local spatial area vary out-ofphase
with each other and not simultaneously. In other words, the
disrelation intensity becomes significant only in regions where
chemically or physically meaningful variations take place. Hence,
this technique became an effective localized highlighting tool with
which to pinpoint the region of interest within a vast spectral
dataset.
3. Experimental
3.1. Preparation of PP/GF composite
Homo-PP and GF were supplied by Prime Polymer and Asahi
Fiber Glass, respectively. The diameter of the GF is approximately
10 lm. Polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) purchased
from Sanyo Chemical was used as a compatibilizer. The
PP and PP-g-MA were mixed with a dispersion mixer (Nihon Spindle
Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) at 50 rpm in a mixing chamber heated
to 220 C. Once the PP and PP-g-MA were sufficiently plasticized,
the GF was fed into the mixture and additional mixing was
employed for 10 min at 50 rpm. The blending ratio of the PP, GF
and PP-g-MA was 69/30/1. The mixture was then pelletized, and
the pellets were molded with a tabletop injection molding
machine, Mold Lock (Century Innovation). Approximately 10 g of
the pellets were heated to 240 C and injected at 5 mL/s and
6 MPa into a mold to form a dumbbell-shaped specimen defined
by the ISO 8256 method [18]. Dumbbell-shaped specimens of the
neat PP were also prepared in a similar manner.
3.2. Tensile testing
Stress–strain curves of the PP/GF and neat PP samples were
measured by a multi-purpose stretching tester (EZ-LX, Shimadzu)
at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min at room temperature (ca. 25 C).
3.3. IR microscopy
A set of FT-IR spectra of the PP/GF sample were collected with a
TENSOR II spectrometer (Bruker) coupled with a Hyperion 3000
microscope equipped with a 64  64 focal plane array detector.
ATR-IR spectra were collected at a spectral resolution of 4 cm1
with the coaddition of 1024 scans over a region of 3800–
500 cm1 by probing a 32 lm  32 lm region with a pixel resolution
of 0.5 lm.
3.4. Raman microscopy
Raman mapping data were collected with an XploRA confocal
Raman microscope (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser as
an excitation light source. The incident laser with a power of 3.7
mW was circularly polarized and focused through a
100  objective (NA = 0.9). The scattered light was collected
through the same objective. Raman lateral (XY-plane) and depth
(YZ-plane) maps were acquired at a spectral resolution of < 3 cm1
over a 2000–100 cm1 wavenumber region by probing a
20 lm  30 lm region and a 30 lm  10 lm region with pixel resolutions
of 1.0 lm  0.5 lm (XY-plane) and 0.5 lm  1.0 lm (YZplane),
respectively.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Mechanical property of PP/GF composite
Fig. 2 shows stress–strain curves of the neat PP and PP/GF composite
samples. The neat PP sample exhibits a gradual increase in
strain at the onset of the deformation, representing the elastic
deformation of the PP. Further elongation of the sample leads to
its plastic deformation. The occurrence of the different deformation
behaviors is mostly associated with the coexistence of the rubbery
amorphous and rigid crystalline structures in the PP sample.
On the other hand, the PP/GF sample exhibits a steep increase in
stress, and this eventually leads to a sudden fracture without the
appearance of any obvious plastic deformation. Although such
variations in mechanical property caused by the incorporation of
GF are commonly considered to be related to the presence of the
GF, which substantially restricts the mechanical displacement of
the system, there is also a need to provide an in-depth understanding
of the phenomena. For example, it is known that an interfacial
interaction between the filler and the matrix in a composite system
often offers the components firm link to improve mechanical property
[14–16]. Thus, spectroscopic imaging may provide an additional
opportunity to examine the molecular-level variations
around the interface between the components. In fact, the development
of a latent interaction between the GF and PP can be readily
identified by IR and Raman disrelation maps as shown later.
4.2. IR imaging of lateral surface area
We first examine IR imaging data for the PP/GF composite as a
reference for later comparison with disrelation maps derived from
the Raman data. Fig. 3(A) shows a visible image of the lateral surface
area scanned with IR microscopy. The bright and dark colored
domains in Fig. 3(A) represent the GF and PP, respectively. Fig. 3(B)
shows IR spectra extracted from the region indicated by the white
arrow in Fig. 3(A). While PP develops several bands in this IR
region, importantly there are no specific IR bands that can be
assigned to the ‘pure’ crystalline or amorphous structure of PP
[19–22]. There are so-called regularity bands arising from the helical
structures of PP, which are essential to crystal formation. For
example, the peak appearing at 973 cm1 in Fig. 3(B) can be
assigned to a shorter helix, which are abundant in an amorphous
component [22]. On the other hand, the band observed at
998 cm1 can be assigned to a longer helix predominantly present
in a crystalline component [22]. Although these IR bands are simply
a reflection of the number of helical turns, their intensity variations
can be used as an empirical inference to identify the changes
in the crystalline and amorphous contents. For instance, the presence
of the very large surface of the GF often substantially lowers
the surface free energy barrier for nucleation and then increases
the frequency of the spontaneous nucleation of the PP crystals. This
interaction eventually induces the additional development of the
crystalline structure of polymer especially around the interface
between the PP and GF. Thus, the intensity variations of the regularity
bands may provide key information when it comes to examining
the possible generation of their surface interaction, which
plays an important role in improving the mechanical property of
a nanocomposite sample. But the variation in the regularity bands
of the PP is dominated by the overwhelming contribution from the
Si-O-Si group of the GF, making it difficult to identify the pertinent
difference between the intensity variations of the regularity bands
[23].
Fortunately, there is a way to selectively attenuate the signal
contribution from a specific peak by using a pre-treatment technique
called null-space projection (NSP). NSP is a method for selectively
removing a specific signal contribution from spectra by
sorting dynamic spectra into two separate sets: one of which is

fully aligned with a chosen projecting vector while the other is
orthogonal to the same vector [24–28]. For example, Fig. 3(C)
shows NSP-treated spectra calculated with the spectra shown in
Fig. 3(B) by using the spectral intensities at 955 cm1 as a projecting
vector which represents the IR absorption by the GF. The spectra
are now free from the intensity change related to the projection
vector while the spectral intensities can be both positive and negative
after the projection treatment. Namely, the NSP-corrected
spectra remain contributions from all other constituents except
for the GF. The variation in the spectral feature in Fig. 3(C) indicates
that, when we move from region A to region B, we encounter a
gradual increase in the PP bands. Such a pattern indeed agrees with
the fact that PP is more abundant in region B than in region A. Thus,
the application of disrelation mapping to the NSP-corrected spectra
makes it possible to obtain pertinent information without being
hampered by the exceptionally dominant contribution of the GF
component.
Fig. 4 shows (A) synchronous and (B) asynchronous correlation
spectra calculated with the NSP-corrected IR spectra shown in
Fig. 3(C). The cross peak appearing at the (998, 973) coordinate
in the synchronous correlation spectrum indicates a simultaneous
change in the spectral intensities of the long helix band (998 cm1)
and short helix band (973 cm1), reflecting the fact that both the
intensities of these PP bands are increasing simultaneously in
Fig. 3(C). One noteworthy observation here is the development of
a pair of cross correlation peaks in the asynchronous correlation
spectrum (Fig. 4(B)). For example, the positive cross peak at the
(998, 973) coordinate in Fig. 4(B) reveals that the IR intensity at
998 cm1 occurs predominantly before that at 973 cm1 when
we look from region A to region B. This sequence implies that
the increases in the long helix and short helix do not happen coincidentally.
In other words, the cross peaks suggest the presence in
this system of a specific region where the crystalline structure
develops greatly. Fig. 4(C) shows a disrelation map constructed
with the intensities at 998 and 973 cm1 of the NSP-corrected IR
spectra selected with 5  5 local window. The disrelation intensity
values in the figure are already normalized to the [01] range for
convenience. The two parallel lines indicated with bright colors
in Fig. 4(C) shows the region developing a strong disrelation intensity
between the long and short helix bands. In other words, the
pattern reveals specific regions where a crystalline structure dominantly
developed. Interestingly, such regions apparently correspond
to the boundary between the GF and PP as shown in Fig. 3
(A). This observation implies that the development of the disrelation
intensity between the long and short helix bands becomes
especially acute when the PP and GF are brought together. It is thus
most likely that the GF must be present for the development of the
additional crystalline structure of the PP. It is also important to
point out that only a pair of parallel lines indicating GF/PP interfaces
is identified in the disrelation map although several fibers
are clearly visualized in Fig. 3(A) as relatively bright areas. Such
pattern can be explained if one assumes that not all the fibers
are exactly on the surface of the object. Some fibers observed in
the visible image may be covered with relatively thin PP layer
which makes it impossible to detect the signals from the GF by
the ATR measurement, although such thin PP layer is not readily
identified by the visible inspection.
4.3. Raman imaging of lateral surface area
It is now instructive to compare the IR disrelation map with
those derived from Raman imaging data to demonstrate the potential
of the Raman disrelation map. Fig. 5(A) and (B), respectively,
are a visible image of the PP/GF sample and Raman spectra collected
from the surface area indicated by the white window seen
in Fig. 5(A). It is noted that regularity bands are also observable
in this Raman region [29]. Peaks at 974 and 1002 cm1 are attributed
to the short helix and long helix, which are essential to the
amorphous and crystalline structures of PP, respectively. Hence,
the correlation analysis of these Raman bands can also provide pertinent
information associated with additional growth of the crystalline
structure.
Fig. 6 shows (A) a disrelation spectrum calculated with the
Raman spectral data shown in Fig. 5(B) and (B) a disrelation map
constructed with the Raman intensities at 1002 and 974 cm1,
respectively. The spectra were subjected to offset baseline collection
prior to the application of the 2D correlation analysis. It is
noted that the disrelation spectrum develops a distinct correlation
peak at (1002, 974), which indicates the dissimilar intensity variations
of the short and long helix bands within the observed area.
Again, the result suggests the presence of a specific spatial area
where the crystalline structure develops greatly in this system.
Another interesting observation here is the development of a pair
of disrelation peaks in the Raman band around 974 cm1. Unfortunately
the origin of these peaks is not clear at this moment, it is
Fig. 4. (A) Synchronous and (B) asynchronous correlation spectra calculated with
the NSP-corrected IR spectra shown in Fig. 3(C). (C) A disrelation map constructed

clear that the emergence of the cross peaks reveals that the Raman
band around 974 cm1 is essentially consisting of two peaks showing
different intensity change within the spatial area. So the pair of
disrelation peaks may indicate the bands each having different
helix length. A disrelation map constructed with the Raman intensities
at 1002 and 974 cm1 by using 5  5 window size is shown in
Fig. 6(B). Two parallel lines with significant disrelation intensity
are generated in the horizontal direction, indicating the greatly
developed crystalline structure at the interface between the GF
and PP. The length of the perpendicular segment between them
agrees well with the actual size of the GF observed in Fig. 5(A).
Consequently, the pattern appearing in the disrelation map represents
the crystalline structure of the PP generated by the surface
interaction between the GF and PP. A possible cause of the additional
crystalline growth induced by the GF may be explained if
we assume that the GF essentially works as a nucleating agent to
cause the additional development of the PP crystalline structure
by lowering the surface energy barrier [30,31]. Another possibility
is due to the nucleating of the PP by the compatibilizer concentrated
at the interface.
It is now interesting to note that the IR and Raman disrelation
mapping analyses were carried out independently but they eventually
provided somewhat similar results indicating the additional
crystalline growth around at the boundary between the GF and PP.
It is likely that disrelation mapping can be effectively utilized for
Raman as well as IR imaging analysis.
4.4. Raman imaging of depth profile
So far, we have examined the IR and Raman spectra collected at
the surface of a PP/GF composite by disrelation mapping. While the
Raman spectra collected at the lateral surface area of the sample
eventually provided information somewhat similar to that derived
from the IR spectra, a disrelation map based on Raman spectra displays
interesting potential when it is applied to the depth-resolved
Raman spectra. For example, Fig. 7(A) shows the visible image of
the PP/GF sample and Fig. 7(B) shows depth-resolved Raman spectra
collected along the white bar shown in Fig. 7(A). The Raman
spectra in Fig. 7(B) again generate regularity bands, which indicate
the presence of different helix structures in the probed area. Hence,

spectra collected inside the white window indicated in Fig. 5(A).

the detailed analysis of intensity variations associated with these
regularity bands provides pertinent information related to inside
the sample.
Fig. 8 (A) shows a disrelation spectrum calculated with the
depth-resolved Raman spectral data of the PP/GF sample. Of note
is that the disrelation spectrum develops a correlation peak at
the (1002, 974) coordinate in Fig. 8(A). This disrelation intensity
implies that the distribution of the long helix component is substantially
different from that of the short helix component inside
the sample. The details of the differences between the distributions
are clearly visualized by a subsequent analysis based on disrelation
mapping. For example, Fig. 8(B) shows a disrelation map constructed
with Raman intensities at 1002 and 974 cm-1of the
depth-resolved Raman spectra by using 5  5 window size. It
should be noted that semi-ellipse shape indicated by a significant
level of disrelation intensity can be observed in the disrelation
map to reveal the area where the crystalline structure develops
greatly inside the sample. This characteristic pattern can be
explained if we assume a nucleating effect induced at the interface
between the GF and PP. Actually, this observation agrees well with
the fact that the length of the minor axis of the semi-ellipse is
approximately 10 lm, which corresponds to the fiber diameter of
the GF. The result again suggests a possible interfacial interaction
between the GF and PP, which cannot be readily identified with
conventional analysis based on mechanical testing. Disrelation
mapping thus provides an additional opportunity for optical sectioning
based on confocal Raman microscopy by highlighting the
feature associated with the chemical interaction between the
components.
5. Conclusion
Confocal Raman microscopy provides intrinsically very rich
information for studying both molecular structure and spatial distribution
inside sample. However, it is not always easy to derive
pertinent information from the Raman imaging data due to the
complexity of the hypercubic data structure. The present study
has demonstrated the potential of disrelation mapping for exploring
complicated Raman imaging data. Sets of Raman spectra of a
PP/GF composite were disentangled by disrelation mapping. The
disrelation maps showed the additional development of the long
helix band induced particularly at the interface between the GF
and PP, indicating the nucleating effect induced by the GF or compatibilizer.
Such predominant crystalline growth was observed
around the GF inside the sample as well as that appearing at the
surface of the sample.
