Abstract: The rapid aging of the population presents great challenges in terms of China’s social
security expenditure and economic growth. This paper uses the entropy method to comprehensively
measure the provincial population aging index in 2008–2019 and constructs an intermediary effect
model with it as the core explanatory variable. The results show that the population aging has a
significant positive impact on economic growth and on the promotion of the economic growth of more
developed areas; it also has a positive impact on the endowment insurance expenditure and medical
and health expenditure and on the promotion of economically backward areas. Endowment spending
and health spending fully mediate the relationship between population aging and economic growth.
Keywords: population aging; endowment insurance expenditure;medical and health care expenditure;
economic growth
1. Introduction
Since the reform and opening, with the rapid economic development of China’s
population and the great progress made in science and technology, the life expectancy of
residents has continued to grow. In 1990, the average life expectancy of China’s population
was 68.6 years, and it reached 76.4 years in 2018, an increase of 7 years [1]. In addition, the
implementation of the family planning policy for many years has greatly reduced the birth
rate of infants, and the reduced proportion of children and the extension of the elderly’s
life expectancy has caused the severe aging situation of China’s population. Statistics
show that, in 2000, China’s population aged 65 and above accounted for 7% of the total
population [1]. According to international standards, China has become an aging society.
By 2021, the proportion will increase to 14.20%, and the population aging coefficient has
about doubled compared with 2000, confirming this reality [1].
The impact of population aging on China’s social and economic growth is mainly
reflected in two aspects. On the one hand, the change in population age structure leads to
the shortage of effective labor supply, which reduces the production efficiency of enterprises
and is not conducive to long-term and stable economic development [2–8]. On the other
hand, population aging requires more social security expenditure, and the continuous
expanding pension fund gap places great pressure on local governments [9–14]. However, it
should not be ignored that population aging also forces enterprises to improve technological
innovation and increase social security spending when reducing labor supply, so it could
drive economic growth [15–17]. Therefore, it cannot be easily concluded whether the
inhibitory impact of population aging on economic growth is positive or negative.
Based on the above background, this paper puts forward the following three questions:
First, does the aging population of China’s economic growth have a promoting
or hindering effect? Second, what is the role of endowment insurance expenditure and
medical insurance expenditure in the impact mechanism of population aging on economic
growth? Third, what are the differences in the impact of population aging on economic
growth in different regions? Grasping the mechanism of the influence of population aging

and social security expenditure on economic growth is of practical significance to promote
the benign interaction between social security expenditure and economic growth under the
background of deep aging.
This paper has the following structure: a literature review, i.e., an analysis of the
theoretical framework of the impact of population aging on China’s economic growth to
highlight the hypothesis of the investigation; methods, i.e., explanations of the applied
methods to investigate the paper’s hypothesis; results, i.e., explanations of the empirical
results of the analysis; discussion and conclusion, i.e., descriptions of the core findings and
recommendations for policy improvements in the sphere of the population aging.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Population Aging and Economic Growth
The impact of population aging on economic growth can be examined from both
the supply side and the demand side. On the supply side, on the one hand, aging has a
labor force effect. Zhang et al. [18] pointed out that China’s new stage of development
has experienced a transition from a demographic dividend to population debt, and the
scarcity of labor force and the rising dependency ratio of the elderly have brought certain
challenges to the economy. Zhu et al. [19] pointed out that, with the increased aging of
the population, the increasing number of elderly people and the increasing pressure on
the young population will reduce the health level of residents, reduce the quality of the
labor force, and have a negative impact on the labor market. In addition, these issues could
be aggravated by the consequences of COVID-19 [20,21]. However, some scholars put
forward different views. Xie X. et al. [22], using panel data from 31 provinces in China from
1998–2017 for empirical analysis, found that an aging population can promote technological
innovation, and the beneficial effect of technological innovation is greater than the adverse
effect of labor reduction, so the aging population has no obvious negative effect on China’s
economic growth in China.
On the other hand, the aging population has a savings effect. According to the
life cycle theory, young individuals will tend to save part of the income for retirement.
After individuals are over a certain age, their savings rate will decline. As the aging
population increases, the overall social savings rate will decline. An aging population
entails a lower savings rate that will threaten economic development in the long term [23].
Some scholars have put forward different views. Wang et al. [24] constructed a threegeneration
overlapping model considering the life extension effect and social burden effect
of population aging. The study found that the negative impact of the social burden effect
caused by the rise in the elderly population on the savings rate was not significant, while
the positive impact of the life extension effect was. Savings can accumulate idle social
funds to invest in large projects, thus promoting economic development.
From the demand side, population aging promotes the increase of medical expenses
and promotes the demand for elderly care services [25–32]. Although Cai et al. [25]
confirmed that the labor participation rate of the elderly is low, the labor income effect
decreases rapidly, and their consumption level will shrink with the increase of age [25],
and the increasing degree of the aging of China’s population. The inhibition of household
consumption rate is increasingly significant [26]. However, these studies ignore the fact
that consumption age is a key factor of consumption structure [27–30], because the elderly’s
consumption habits are particular. The increase of the elderly population will lead to a new
consumer demand structure, although the elderly demand for fashion clothing, jewelry,
and other luxuries is relatively weak. However, for nutrition care and longevity pension
products, demand is relatively large, leading to new opportunities for the development of
the silver economy. Ma et al. [31] found that population aging can promote the transfer of
the labor force to the advanced industrial sector, which is conducive to the development
of the advanced industry. Fang W. [32] found through empirical analysis that China’s
population aging promotes the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure. The
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12171 3 of 15
rationalization and upgrading of the industrial structure can effectively promote economic
development. Thus, considering it:
Hypothesis 1. China’s population aging has a positive role in promoting economic growth.
2.2. Population Aging, Endowment Insurance Expenditure, and Economic Growth
Practice shows that the development history of China’s social security reflects the
role of China’s social security in unleashing the potential of economic growth, and that
this growth in turn promotes the development of the social security system [33]. The
improvement of the social security system has a positive role in eliminating poverty and
promoting residents’ consumption, and can effectively promote economic growth [34].
Various expenditure items of social security expenditure have a different effect on economic
growth. In the serious stage of population aging in China, social security expenditure and
medical and health expenditure have a crowding-out effect on other expenditures [35].
The following will be mainly analyzed from two aspects: pension expenditure and health
expenditure.
With the growth of the average life expectancy of the Chinese population and the
aggravation of population aging, individuals increasingly receive a pension, and the
endowment insurance expenditure increases year by year. Liu X. [36], through building
an economic model, shows that population life expectancy growth will increase pension
fund spending. As an important source of economic development, pension fund assets are
important for long-term investment in less developed countries [37]. Increased pension
spending inevitably reduces the amount of pension retained, but pension spending can
boost economic growth by stimulating consumption. Endowment insurance fund pay is
actually indirect savings for people in the future, which decreases residents’ disposable
income in the current period, but national endowment insurance spending through an
endowment insurance fund will be redistributed to residents to increase their disposable
income, thus improving the stability of the group and their consumption ability, obviously
conducive to economic growth. Zhang et al. [38] found through empirical research that
social endowment insurance can effectively stimulate the consumption of the elderly, thus
leading to improved economic benefits.
Hypothesis 2. Population aging has a positive effect on endowment insurance expenditure.
Hypothesis 3. Population aging will affect economic growth through pension spending.
2.3. Population Aging, Medical and Health Care Expenditure, and Economic Growth
Individuals’ demand for health capital increases as age increases, and the demand for
medical services increases accordingly. Li et al. [39] used Beijing as an example for empirical
analysis and found a significant positive relationship between aging and the growth rate of
medical costs. Tian et al. [40] conducted an empirical analysis through a fixed-effect model,
and the results show that population aging will significantly increase the social security,
employment, and medical and health expenditure in areas with high levels of economic
development. However, scholars have questioned the positive relationship between aging
and medical expenses. Thus, some studies [41–43] suggest that the role of aging on medical
costs is exaggerated, and the high medical costs paid to save lives before the end of life are
greatly ignored. The question suggests that the high health costs before the end of life are
the main reason for the increase in health costs. However, from another perspective, it is
poor functioning and immunity that makes them more vulnerable to death. Taking Beijing
as an example, in the age distribution of medical expenses, the medical expenses of the
elderly aged 60 and above account for about half of the total medical expenses, indicating
that the elderly population is the main consumer of social medical resources [39]. Growth
in the elderly population will promote an increase in health care spending. At the same
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12171 4 of 15
time, the differences in population development laws in different countries also mean
that foreign experience is not fully applicable to China. Lopreite et al. [44] compared the
demographic structure and economic trajectory of the United States and China, showing
that the impact of an aging population on health spending and economic growth is more
pronounced in China.
Health and health spending can affect economic growth. First, increased medical and
health expenditure can improve social medical and health conditions, especially the quality
of medical and health services in rural areas, so as to effectively guarantee the health level
of workers and thus ensure the high-quality supply of the labor force. An empirical study
by Xie et al. [45] shows that increasing government health expenditure can improve the
stability and growth level of rural economic development. Second, increased government
spending on health care will stimulate the expansion of demand for health services. Tao
et al. [46], based on an analysis of a panel threshold regression model, found that the
government health expenditure would play a positive role in promoting the residents’
medical care consumption, thus driving the growth of overall social consumption. Finally,
the increase of government medical and health expenditure is conducive to promoting the
development of the medical and health service industry, the expansion of employment
capacity, and economic growth.
Hypothesis 4. Population aging has a positive promoting effect on health care expenditure.
Hypothesis 5. Population aging will contribute to economic growth through health care spending.
3. Materials and Methods
The existing measure of population aging generally used internationally is based
on the proportion of the elderly population in the total population. This method can
measure the degree of aging of a country or region, but it cannot measure the depth
of population aging; the impact of population aging on the social burden caused by a
region is not considered, which is often affected by the proportion of children and the
proportion of labor population. Therefore, this paper constructs a measurement index
system of population aging and comprehensively considers the breadth, depth, and speed
of population aging in a region.
3.1. The Population Aging Index Measure
The entropy method is used to weight the index system to obtain the degree of
population aging. This method is based on macro data and is objective and scientific
compared with traditional subjective value judgments. The principle of entropy value
calculation steps is as follows:
(1) Initial matrix
Assuming n indicators and m study samples, the initial data matrix is
X =

xij

m  n (1)
where X is the initial data matrix; xij is the ith value of the jth index of the system.
(2) Standardized treatment
The data in Equation (1) is standardized. If the value of an index and the evaluation
result change in the same direction, it is a positive index, and the standardization formula is
Y =
(Xij 􀀀 Xmin)
(Xmax 􀀀 Xmin)
(2)
Conversely, the negative index standardization equation is
Y =
(Xmax 􀀀 Xij)
(Xmax 􀀀 Xmin)
(3)
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12171 5 of 15
The normalized matrix is obtained:
Y =

yij

(4)
(3) Entropy value calculation
The information entropy value of the j-item index is
ej = 􀀀k
må
i=1
fij ln fij, (i = 1, 2 . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n) (5)
among
fij =
yij
åm
i=1 yij
(6)
where ej is the entropy value of the item j index; k is a constant, where k = 1/ln(m); fij is the
weight of the ith value of the item j index.
(4) Weight calculation
The degree of consistency of each scheme under the jth attribute dj = 1 􀀀 ej. The weight
formula of each attribute can be obtained as follows:
Wj = dj/ån
j=1 dj (7)
In this paper, through the breadth, depth, and speed of population aging, we respectively
select the corresponding measurement indicators to obtain the comprehensive level
of the degree of population aging. The selection of indicators is shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Index system and attributes of population aging.
Level 1 Indicators Secondary Indicators Attribute

The proportion of children’s population negative indicators

Child support ratio forward pointer

The index data of this paper were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics and
the National Statistical Yearbook [1]. Thirty-one Chinese provinces (autonomous regions
and municipalities directly under the Central Government) were selected as the research
subjects and divided into eastern, central, and western regions. The provincial index data
from 2008 to 2019 were collected and compiled, and the average geometric growth rate was
calculated to compensate for individual missing data.
3.2. Model Construction and Variable Description
The variables selected for the model construction are shown in Table 2. Thus, the
explained variable is the local economic growth level. The explanatory variable is the
population aging index. The intermediary variables are the pension insurance expenditure
and the health care expenditure. The control variables include the urbanization rate, the
population education level, and the natural population growth rate. The economic growth
level is measured by the per capita GDP, and the population aging index is calculated by
the entropy method.

To test the hypothesis, the following model is constructed using [47]:
VGDPi,t = 
 + 1AoPi,t + 1UBRi,t + 2PELi,t + 3NPGRi,t + "I (8)
PFEi,t = 
 + 1AoPi,t + 2UBRi,t + 3PELi,t + 4NPGRi,t + "i I (9)
MPEi,t = 
 + 1AoPi,t + 2UBRi,t + 3PELi,t + 4NPGRi,t + "i I (10)
VGDPi,t = 
 + 1AoPi,t + 2PFEi,t + 3UBRi,t + 4PELi,t + 5NPGRi,t + "i I (11)
VGDPi,t= 
 +  1AoPi,t +  2MPEi,t +  3UBRi,t +  4PELi,t +  5NPGRi,t + "i i (12)
Equation (8) tests the total effect of the relationship between population aging and
economic growth. Thus, Equation (9) tests the relationship between population aging and
pension fund expenditure, and Equation (11) adds intermediary variables to population
aging and economic growth. First, to test Equation (8), if the coefficient is significant in
Equation (7), the next step will be applied. If the coefficient d1 and q2 (Equations (9) and (11))
are significant, the mediation effect will exist. If one is insignificant, the fourth step test is
required. According to the test results of the previous step, if in Equation (11) coefficient
q1 is not significant, it will mean that there is a complete mediation effect. Thus, the
explanatory variable to affect the explained variable should pass through the mediation
variable. Otherwise, there is a partial mediation effect. The part of the influence is realized
through the mediation effect. The study applied the Bootstrap sampling method.
Multicollinearity diagnosis was performed using SPSS software, and the variance
expansion factor of each variable was less than 10, indicating that there was no multicollinearity
among the independent variables. Regression analysis of the samples yielded
the following results for each regression.
4. Results

4.2. Difference Analysis of the Regional Population Aging Index
According to the entropy method, the population aging index in the east, central, and
west regions of China can also be calculated. As shown in Table 4, the population aging
index varied greatly between the three regions. The eastern index is the largest, with an
average value of 0.448, followed by the central part with a mean value of 0.418 and the
west with a mean value of 0.374.

The largest coefficient of variation was in the west, followed by the eastern and central
regions. The difference in the population aging index was the largest among the western
provinces and the smallest in the central region. The eastern region had the largest breadth,
and the provinces differed the most. In contrast, the eastern region has the smallest depth,
with an average of 5.930, compared to 6.701 and 7.236 in the central and western regions.

Finally, the rate of aging was almost similar in each region, with the largest differences in
the western region, followed by the east.
The secondary measures are shown in Table 5. The eastern region has the largest aging
population coefficient, while the western region has the largest population ratio of children.

One reason that the social burden in the west is heavier than that in other regions is
that their children are raised for longer periods of time. The eastern region has the largest
ratio of young people, i.e., 0.819, with 0.644 in the central region and 0.505 in the west. It
can be seen that population aging in the eastern region is a large social burden, although the
western region’s social burden is also heavy. This is largely due to the burden of children.
In the long term, the western region has a sufficient labor force that can better cope with
the burden of support for the elderly.
4.3. Test of the Intermediary Effect of the Pension Fund Expenditure
At the next step of the investigation the intermediary role of the pension fund on the
relationship between population aging and economic growth was calculated. The findings
are shown in Table 6.

economic growth.

The findings (Table 6) show that population aging has a significant positive impact on
economic growth, with an impact coefficient of 0.307, significant at the 1% level.
The population aging index had a positive impact on the growth of pension insurance
expenditure, with a coefficient of 2.550, significant at the 1% level. Population aging
has increased the number of elderly people receiving pensions, greatly increasing the
expenditure of China’s pension insurance fund. In recent years, some provinces even have
a gap in the current period. Statistics [1] show that China’s urban pension funds spent
5130.14 billion yuan in 2020, while the income was 4437.57 billion yuan.
Pension fund expenditure has a significant positive effect on economic growth, with an
impact coefficient of 0.123, significant at the 1% level. The expenditure of pension insurance
fund will increase the disposable income of the elderly and stimulate the consumption
demand of the elderly, especially the demand for elderly care services, such as the elderly
care demand, community medical care demand, and the demand for elderly supplies.
Health and pension consumption of the elderly will show a growing trend in the future.
In Model 3, the effects of population aging and endowment insurance expenditure
were added to test the impact on economic growth. The impact coefficient of endowment
insurance expenditure was positive and significant, while the impact of population aging
index was no longer significant, indicating that it had a complete intermediary effect.
The mediation effect test results show that pension expenditure has a complete intermediary
effect on the relationship between population aging index and economic growth.
This also provides an alternative explanation path for China’s population aging to promote
economic growth.
In Model 2, the urbanization rate, the population education level, and the natural
population growth rate all had a significant positive impact on the economy. From the
current situation of China, the pension insurance contribution rate of general urban workers
is higher than that of rural areas, and the corresponding pension treatment of the
corresponding urban elderly people is also relatively high. Consequently, a higher urbanization
rate increases the endowment insurance expenditure. A higher level of population
education level increases the attention paid to endowment insurance, and the enthusiasm
of paying endowment insurance premiums are relatively high, leading to greater pension
security after retirement. A higher natural population growth rate leads to greater
pension spending.
In Model 3, the urbanization rate, the population education level, and the natural
population growth rate have a positive impact on the economic growth, and they are
significant at the 1% level. Urbanization clearly plays an important role in promoting
economic development. A higher level of population education leads to a higher quality
of social human capital, contributing to economic growth. A higher natural population
growth rate leads to a more complementary total population and more abundant labor
resources, a major factor of economic growth.
4.4. Mediation Effect Test of Medical and Health Care Expenditure
Table 7 shows the mediating role of health expenditure in the relationship between
population aging and economic growth. The population aging had a positive effect on
medical and health expenditure at the 1% level, with an effect coefficient of 1 (Model 2).
China’s medical and health expenditure increased significantly as it became an aging
population society.
Statistics show that the average annual growth rate of China’s medical and health
expenditure was about 18% from 2008 to 2019, and in 2008, the medical and health expenditure
accounted for 1.12% of the fiscal expenditure and then gradually increased
to 6.78%.

Population education and natural population growth promote health and health
expenditure. In addition, the higher the level of population education, the more attention to
health services is paid, and the higher the demand for national health resources investment.
A higher natural population growth rate will inevitably lead to the expansion of the total
scale and, naturally, a greater demand for medical and health expenditure. Therefore,
health expenditure has a positive impact on economic growth, with an impact coefficient of
0.179, significant at the 1% level. Thus, an increase in health spending can boost economic
growth. Statistics also show that, compared with 2008, the number of medical and health
institutions in China increased by about 13%, health personnel increased by about 78%,
and the total health cost increased by three times. On the one hand, the considerable
health costs promote the growth of medical consumption and promote the development
of medical and health services; on the other hand, medical employment and household
income level also increase. In addition, the development of the medical service industry
can effectively improve the health of residents, as it can supply more high-quality labor for
economic growth. At the same time, two explanatory variables of population aging index
and health care expenditure were added to Model 3, and the population aging index had
no significant effect.
4.5. Analysis of Regional Heterogeneity Tests for Five-Point Samples
The level of population aging varies significantly in different regions of China, so the
entire sample was divided into three regions for sample testing and to analyze the impact
of population aging on economic growth in different regions.
The regression results of the eastern, central, and western population aging index on
economic growth, pension expenditure, and health expenditure are arranged in Table 8.
Considering the findings (Table 8), a positive impact of population aging on economic
growth exists in the eastern and central regions, and its influence coefficients are 0.310
and 0.560, indicating that population aging has the greatest effect on economic growth
in Central China. However, the impact on the economic growth of Western China is not
significant, and the impact coefficient is only 0.165. The population aging in Western
China is mild among the three regions, and the proportion of children in Western China is
high to a certain extent. The impact of the population aging index on economic growth is
not obvious.

Secondly, population aging has a significant positive impact on the endowment insurance
expenditure, among which the western influence coefficient is the largest, with 2.931,
followed by the east, where it is 2.251. In the central part, the influence coefficient is 1.635.
It can be seen that, in the central and western regions, the positive impact of population
aging on endowment insurance expenditure is significant.
The positive impact of population aging on health care expenditure was significant in
all three regions. The influence coefficient is the largest in the western region, followed by
the central region and the eastern region. Furthermore, the population aging index has a
greater effect on the social security expenditure in the economically underdeveloped areas.
The results in Tables 9 and 10 show that the pension insurance expenditure and
healthcare expenditure both had a positive impact on economic growth. It should be noted
that the central region had the largest impact coefficient, followed by the eastern region
and the western region.

Thus, the findings show that the intermediary effect of pension fund expenditure is
significant (Tables 8 and 9). Combining Tables 8 and 10 shows that the mediation effect of
Medicare funds in various regions was significant. Meanwhile, the Bootstrap sampling
method was tested for each mediation effect, which showed a complete mediation effect.
The findings validate the results of the full-sample analysis presented in the paper.
5. Discussion and Conclusions
This paper uses the data of 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the Central Government) from 2008 to 2019 and uses the entropy method
to comprehensively calculate the degree of population aging in 31 provinces in China in
terms of the breadth, depth, and speed of population aging, and the regional differences
are compared and analyzed.
A regression model was applied to study the relationship between population aging,
endowment insurance expenditure, medical and health expenditure, and economic growth.
Empirical research results show the following:
(1) There are significant differences in the degree of population aging among regions. The
eastern region has the highest degree of population aging, with the lowest degree
in the west. The heavy burden of children can effectively alleviate the pressure of
population aging in the future.
(2) The aging population has a significant positive effect. In addition, the endowment
insurance expenditure and medical and health expenditure have a positive effect.
However, there are more obvious differences in this effect between regions. The
economic growth of the more developed areas is more significant compared with
economically backward areas, which have high levels of endowment insurance expenditure
and medical and health spending.
(3) The role of population aging on economic growth can play an intermediary role
through endowment insurance expenditure and medical and health care expenditure.
Different from some scholars’ view that population aging has a negative impact on the
economy, the empirical results confirm that the positive impact of population aging on
China’s economic growth is greater than its negative impact. Its internal mechanism is
that population aging promotes economic growth by increasing endowment insurance
and medical and health expenditure.
The comprehensive level of China’s population aging was calculated in multiple
dimensions, showing the influence mechanism of population aging on China’s economic
growth, which has enlightening policy implications for the establishment of a benign
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12171 13 of 15
interaction between social security and economic development and the overall coordination
of regional economic development.
First, the Chinese government should improve birth policy in China and encourage
the birth of two and three children, especially in the eastern region, which suffers severe
population aging. It is also necessary to formulate strong relevant supporting policies to
encourage people to have children and fundamentally curb the year-by-year decreasing
trend of the labor force and population. At the same time, the Chinese government should
accelerate the implementation of a delayed retirement system, gradually raise the legal
retirement age, implement differentiated retirement pension policies in different regions,
and ensure a sufficient amount and structural balance of labor resources.
Second, it is necessary to improve the social security system, especially the endowment
insurance and medical insurance systems. In recent years, the Chinese pension insurance
fund has faced severe challenges in financial sustainability. In addition to increasing public
financial investment, the state-owned capital transfer should enrich endowment insurance
funds. Furthermore, the government should improve the national pension adjustment
system, improve and stabilize residents’ future pension expectations, and improve the
level of pension consumption of the elderly. At the same time, China should improve
the medical service environment and actively promote the development of medical and
health care undertakings with more preferential policies. This would allow for increased
investment in medical and health care.
Finally, in view of the differences in population aging by region, it is necessary to
improve the construction of a multi-level labor market. Thus, the labor force could transfer
freely between urban and rural areas, regions, and industries and balance the supply
and demand of the labor force in the three regions. At the same time, China should
focus on increasing old-age insurance and the medical and health care expenditure in the
central and western regions. The sustainable economic growth in the central and western
regions is promoted through the intermediary effect of old-age insurance and medical
insurance expenditure.
Despite the valuable findings, this investigation has a few limitations. Firstly, in future
investigations, it will be necessary to extend the list of variables that affect population
aging and the country’s economic growth. Thus, it is necessary to analyze government
efficiency, well-being, the public health system, globalization, and environmental pollution.
In addition, the study does not consider the cointegration between the public health system
and government efficiency, which allows for the allocation of appropriate incentives to
improve the population’s well-being without decreasing economic development. Furthermore,
it is necessary to increase the objects of the investigation, which would enable a
comparison between countries/cities and the identification of best practices that improve
the population’s well-being.
