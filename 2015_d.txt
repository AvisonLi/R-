      Abstract: In recent years, population aging has been recognized as an emerging challenge
      in many parts of the world. Earlier studies discussed its impacts on the sustainability of
      social security systems and national economic growth; however, they tended to focus on
      the issues at the national level and were limited to developed countries. With the knowledge
      that population aging will be a predominant trend in both developed and developing
      countries, this paper aims to: (i) describe the global population aging trend and its regional
      demography; (ii) provide a structural review of population aging challenges at the national,
      communal and individual levels; and (iii) elaborate future research topics on population
      aging with a particular emphasis on developing countries. Several indicators suggest rapid
      population aging in the coming decades, especially in Asia, Latin America and Africa. The
      structural review presents the diverse challenges that affect both young and older population
      groups. Finally, the need for linking population aging with the sustainable development
      concept and the possible rural decline caused by rapid urbanization are suggested as future
      research topics. Further studies to establish a body of knowledge on population aging in
      developing countries are required to place population aging on the agenda of future
      sustainable development discussions.

1. Introduction

    In recent years, population aging has been recognized as an emerging social challenge in many parts
of the world. Some clear evidence of population aging is observed; for example, the share of the aged
60-plus population in the world increased from eight percent in 1950 to 12 percent in 2014, and it is
predicted to be 21 percent by 2050 [1]. The global life expectancy also increased from 47 years in 1950
to 70 years in 2014, and a further increase to 75 years is expected by 2050 [2–4]. Only a few decades
ago, the major concern regarding world demography was its rapid growth and increasing pressure on
the ecosystem and food security [5,6]. While population growth will continue in some fast-growing
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [7], the population aging phenomenon will have
profound impacts on various dimensions of society, and this aging trend will be intensified in the
coming decades [8,9].
    Although there is an accumulation of studies about population aging covering diverse topics,
existing literature concentrates on population aging mainly in developed countries. Population aging is
largely seen as a threat to: (i) sustainable economic growth due to the possible shrinkage of the labor
force [10,11]; and (ii) social security systems to support the elderly, such as pension plans, healthcare
schemes and long-term care insurance [12–15]. In contrast to these alarmist views, some call attention
to the emerging “silver market” to illustrate a positive economic outlook ([16], pp. 22–23; [17,18]).
Moreover, possible mitigation of economic decline is suggested by way of increasing female labor
participation and policy reforms regarding the legal retirement age [19].
    Despite the wide coverage of the earlier literature, these issues may represent only part of the entire
picture of population aging because they are limited to macro-scale changes derived from population
estimations. Furthermore, compared to the volume of knowledge on the cases of developed countries,
little is known about the actual changes that people, both elderly and young population groups, are and
will be experiencing in developing countries.
    With the increase of life expectancies and the actual size of the older population defining an era of
aging societies, in which increasing proportions of older populations will continue in the coming
decades, what kinds of challenges should we expect? Given the expected impacts of population aging
in the coming decades, this paper aims to: (i) describe population aging trends in the world and the
regional demography; (ii) provide a structural review of population aging challenges at three levels,
namely the national, the communal and the individual levels; and (iii) elaborate future research topics
on population aging that particularly emphasize the situation of developing countries. For the third
objective, this study briefly introduces the current state of rural Japan, which is possibly the most aged
region in the world. The case of rural Japan is presented to illustrate the emerging population aging
challenges in rural areas where the aging phenomenon is happening rapidly.

2. The Era of Aging Societies

2.1. Population Aging in the World and the Regional Demography

   As was briefly mentioned in the previous section, the world demography is shifting to an era of
population aging. Figure 1 presents the demographic changes of the world and three sub-regions1 with
four age groups, and the share of older populations (aged 60-plus) from 1950–2100. As the figure of
the “World” clearly shows, aging will emerge as a strong trend in the world demography. At the same
time, Figure 1 also illustrates different patterns of population aging in three sub-groups.




       Figure 1. Population trends of the world and three sub-groups with four age groups and the
       shares of the aged 60-plus population. Note: Created from population estimations for
       1950–2010 and population projections with a medium fertility rate for 2015–2100 by the
       United Nations.

   In the world demography, the older population group remained below 10 percent from 1950–2010
(“World” in Figure 1). The predictions suggest a steady increase of this age group from 2015 onward.
The share of the older population is predicted to reach 21.5 percent by 2050 and 28.3 percent by 2100.
Although some scholars suggest that the world population may stabilize at around 10 billion people
after 2050 [20], aging will remain as a clear trend in the world demography in the coming decades.

    Definitions of “more developed regions”, “less developed regions” and “least developed countries” are adopted from
    the UN population statistics. The more developed regions include all countries in Europe, North America, Australia,
    New Zealand and Japan. The less developed regions include all countries in Africa, Asia (except Japan), South
    America, Latin America and the Caribbean. The least developed countries represent a list of 48 countries set by the UN.
    The least developed countries are also included in less developed regions.


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                    943

   In the case of more developed regions, population aging was already present in the late 1970s as the
share of the older population exceeded 15 percent by 1975, and it further increased to 21.9 percent by
2010 (“More developed regions” in Figure 1). One key demographic feature of developed regions is
that the total population will be stabilized at around 1.28 billion from 2030 onward. At the same time,
the size of the older-old (age 80-plus) group is expected to increase steadily. This demographic pattern
will create a further increase in the share of the older population to 32.8 percent by 2050 and to
34.6 percent by 2100.
   In the less developed regions, population aging will quickly evolve from 2020–2060 as the share of
the older population is predicted to double from 11.9 percent to 21.8 percent (“Less developed
regions” in Figure 1). Although the acceleration of population aging will be slower, the aging trend
will continue to be on the rise, with an increase to 27.5 percent by 2100.
   In contrast to the other two sub-regions, the least developed countries will experience rather gradual
population aging. As Figure 1 shows, the share of the older population is predicted to increase
gradually from 5.3 percent in 2010 to 9.8 percent by 2050 (“Least developed countries” in Figure 1).
From 2050 onward, aging will be accelerated in these countries, with the proportion of the older
population expected to reach 20.5 percent by 2100.
   Along with its share, the actual size of the older population is also important. Figure 2 presents the
projection of the aged 60-plus population in six regions of the world. Among them, Asia will be home
to 1.3 billion of the elderly by 2050 and 1.6 billion by 2100. Africa will be the region with the second
largest population of older people by 2100, with 844.4 million people. Latin America will also
experience a drastic increase of the older population from 70 million in 2015 to 200 million by 2050,
and a further increase to 269.9 million by 2100. In contrast, in Europe, Northern America and Oceania,
the pace of older population increase will not be as significant as the other regions (Figure 2).

2.2. Demographic Causes of Population Aging

   Population aging is mainly caused by two demographic changes: (i) decline in fertility rates; and (ii)
increase in life expectancy ([7,21,22]; [23], pp. 13–20; [24,25]). These two demographic changes are
long-lasting and largely irreversible as countries achieve social and economic development [26].
   As Figure 3 shows, the decline in the fertility rate has been a long-term trend in both the world and
regional demography. The total fertility rate in 1950 at the global level was 4.9 births per woman. The
figure dropped to 2.6 births by 2010, and a further decline to 2.0 births is expected by 2050. At the
regional level, the decline in fertility rate has been particularly noticeable in Europe and Asia. In
Europe, the figure dropped from 2.7 births per woman in 1950 to 1.5 in 2010, and an additional slight
decline to 1.5 births by 2050 is predicted. As for Asia, the figure was 5.8 births per woman in 1950,
but it dropped to 2.3 by 2010 and is projected to be 1.9 by 2050. Although Africa still has as high as 4.8
births per woman today, the region is on a long-term declining trend. The projection suggests that the
fertility rate of Africa will decline to 3.1 births per woman by 2050. As Figure 3 illustrates clearly, low
fertility rates are common across all regions, and this trend will be accelerated in the coming decades [27].

      total fertility estimations for 1950–2010 and projections with a medium fertility variant for
      2015–2050 by the United Nations.

   The second demographic cause of population aging, the increase of life expectancy, increased
significantly both in the world and regional demography. Figure 4 depicts a long-term trend of life
expectancies for the world and six regions. The world average was 46.8 years in 1950, and it increased
to 68.8 years by 2010 (22-year increase). Asia and Africa were two regions with lower life expectancies
than the world average in 1950 at 42.1 years and 37.3 years, respectively. By 2010, Asia surpassed the


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                        945

world average at 71.6 years, although Africa still remained much lower than the world average at
56.5 years. Latin America had about a five-year longer life expectancy than the world average in 1950
at 51.2 years, and it increased to 74.5 years by 2010. Northern America was the region with the longest
life expectancy at 68.6 years in 1950. This region already surpassed 70 years by 1970 and further
increased to 79.2 years by 2010. Europe and Oceania regions also had about 15–18-year longer life
expectancies than the world average in 1950. These regions also experienced an increase, to 77.5 years
by 2010. Towards 2050, the life expectancies in Asia, Northern America, Latin America, Europe and
Oceania are projected to increase further. Asia is expected to reach 78.0 years, and the remaining four
regions are expected to reach somewhere between 81.0 and 84.0 years. Although Africa will continue
to have lower life expectancy than the world average, the region’s figure is expected to increase
sharply to 66 years by 2030 and nearly 70 years by 2050. Overall, as Figure 4 also presents, the world
average life expectancy increase will be a 30-year increase from 1950–2050.




      Figure 4. Trends in life expectancy at birth in the world and six regions. Note: Created
      from life expectation estimations at birth from 1950–2010 and projections with medium
      fertility variant for 2015–2050 by the United Nations.

    In addition to the increase in life expectancy at birth, the increase of life expectancy at older ages is
also a major contributor to population aging. Shrestha (2000) [28] states that population aging is
defined by demographers as “an increasing median age of a population or an alteration in the age
structure of a population, so that elderly persons are increasingly represented within a country’s overall
age structure”. However, population aging is also about people living longer lives than they did in the
past, as life expectancies, particularly at older ages, have improved [29]. Table 1 shows the trends of
life expectancy at age 60 in the world and six regions for males and females. In the world population, a
60-year-old male could expect a remaining 13.1 years in 1950, while this increased to 17.8 years by


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                                                     946

2000 and is predicted to reach 21.7 years by 2050. As for a 60-year-old female, it was 15.3 years in
1950, 20.8 years in 2000, and it is expected to be 24.3 years by 2050. In each region, in general, there
is an increasing trend in life expectancy of about 6–10 years from 1950–2050. Females, throughout
this time, have about a two- to three-year longer life expectancies than males.

3. Pervasiveness and Acceleration of Population Aging

   As previous sections illustrate, one key characteristic of the population aging phenomenon is its
pervasiveness both in developed and developing countries. In terms of geographical expansion, those
areas with more than 20 percent of their population being age 60-plus are concentrated in Europe,
North America, Oceania and Japan in 2014. However, by 2050, countries with the same proportion of
elderly people will expand to both North and South America, the entirety of the Eurasian continent
and a wide area of the Asia and Pacific region, even in some countries in Northern Africa and the
Middle East [30–32].
   In developing countries, the expansion of population aging is happening at a much faster pace than
developed countries. Another common indicator to measure the degree of population aging is to
examine the time (number of years) elapsed for the increase in the share of the aged 65-plus population


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                       947

or the elderly dependency ratio (EDR) from 7–14 percent [22,33–35]. Furthermore, some scholars have
put forward 21 percent (or 20 percent or higher) as another figure to illustrate a super- or hyper-aging
society [10,36–38]. Reflecting these possible benchmark figures, Figure 5 presents the number of years
taken or predicted to take for three aging transitions at the societal level. Each phase of transition is in
multiples of 7–28 percent. As for the first transition, from 7–14 percent, European and North American
countries took a half to one century to achieve this transition. For example, France, Norway and Sweden
took more than 80 years; Australia, Canada and the United States needed more than 60 years; and even
the shortest cases—Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom—took more than 40 years. In contrast,
the first transition took place or is predicted to happen within 30 years in Asian and South American
countries. It will be particularly short, less than 20 years, in Brazil, Colombia, South Korea and Vietnam.

      each aging transition occurred or is predicted to occur.

   The second and third aging transitions are predicted to happen within a much shorter amount of
time in developed countries. The second transition, from 14–21 percent, is expected to happen in less
than 60 years for Europe, less than 20 years for Canada and the United States and in around 10–15
years for Asia and South American countries. All countries listed in Figure 5 will complete the second
aging transition by 2050. Although the third aging transition may take a longer time for some
European countries, it is also expected to occur as rapidly as the second transition in the majority of
countries (Figure 5). Currently, only Japan, Germany and Italy have reached the second aging transition,


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                      948

and among these three countries, Japan is the most rapidly aging country, as it will reach the third
transition by 2019. In general, the number of years taken or predicted to take for these three aging
transitions are expected to be lower as these countries move to later transitions in the future.
   As Figure 5 illustrates, population aging will be greatly accelerated in the coming decades and have
profound impacts both in developed and developing countries. This phenomenal acceleration of
population aging would particularly be a peril for developing countries, as they have to face the emerging
demands for medical treatment, long-term care and financial support for aging societies before they
fully benefit from their economic development ([39], pp. 30–47; [40,41]; [42], pp. 86–95). Responses
to population aging and related social challenges must be developed according to the speed of
population aging in developing countries.

4. Population Aging at Three Different Levels

    As numerous profound impacts of population aging are anticipated, it is important to structurally
analyze the expected challenges at different levels. This point is also supported by Bloom et al.
(2011) [43], as they propose adaptation strategies to population aging at three different levels:
(i) societal; (ii) organizational; and (iii) individual levels. Employing a set of analytical levels will
greatly help, particularly developing countries, to foresee possible challenges. In this paper, the authors
propose using (i) national; (ii) communal; and (iii) individual levels to delineate the emerging population
aging challenges.

4.1. Population Aging Challenges at the National Level

   At the national level, in developed countries, population aging is often framed as an imminent issue for
social welfare systems, which are based on the balance between the older population who receives services
and the younger population who supports the system’s operation ([12,44]; [45], pp. 9–28; [46,47]). In
2010, there were four persons of working population age (age 15–64) to support one older person
(aged 65-plus) in developed countries; however, this ratio is predicted to decline to three working age
persons to one older person by 2025 [7]. This change in the balance between the older population and
the younger population is caused by the rapid increase of the older-old population (aged 80-plus) in the
coming decades [2]. Since public insurance for medical and geriatric services is covered almost
universally in developed countries [48] and the older-old persons have a higher risk of suffering from
chronic diseases and developing disabilities [49,50], there will be considerable pressure on welfare
budgetary schemes. For example, Japan, the most aged country in the world where the aged 65-plus
population accounts for 25.1 percent of the population, the share of social security expenditure of the
country’s total national income increased from 5.8 percent in 1970 to 29.6 percent in 2010. In actual
terms, 70.5 trillion yen (equivalent to 579.5 billion US dollars) was spent on elderly care, which is
equivalent to 68.1 percent of total social security expenditure. This figure was the largest ever, yet
continual increases are expected [51].
   In the context of developing countries, where social welfare schemes are not yet well established,
the main challenge is to adequately respond to the escalating medical and other needs of the elderly.
Among these countries, the impact of aging will be felt most drastically in China, as the country has
the largest aging population, which is 160 million aged 60-plus people [52]. Considering the country’s


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                        949

shortage of nursing centers, the difficulty in constructing care facilities fast enough to catch up with the
growing aging population and the relatively expensive medical costs for low and middle-income
people in China, it will be important to train geriatric care workers, to prepare a policy to cover uninsured
and underinsured elderly and to build a strategy to cope with the expected increase of elderly with
disabilities [53,54]. Although there is a considerable difference in terms of the speed and scale of aging
transitions in each country, the development of socioeconomic systems to provide economic security
for the growing older population will be a shared concern among developing countries [22].

4.2. Population Aging at the Communal Level

   The definition of the communal level needs to be flexible, since this level includes all units of
society between the national and the individual levels. In a practical sense, the communal level
includes all administrative units below the national government, such as provincial and municipal areas,
and those smaller units of social groups, such as neighborhood communities or voluntary groups of
residents. In addition, the focus of the communal level is not limited to the well-being of the elderly.
The core challenge at this level is about securing adequate living conditions for all generations and
maintaining the livelihood of societies while facing population aging challenges.
   As for developed countries, topics discussed at the communal level in earlier literature have varied
across urban and rural areas. The issues of shrinking cities and abandonment of facilities, such as complex
housing, are discussed in relation to the living environment of elderly residents in urban areas [55,56].
Recent urban, community-based initiatives, such as Groundwork in the United Kingdom [57,58] or
Machizukuri (participatory planning process) in Japan [59], are exemplary communal initiatives that
aim to create social ties by enhancing citizens’ participation in city and neighborhood planning [60].
These bottom-up and autonomous approaches in community design enable the community members to
address the demands of older residents. These local initiatives encourage residents’ collective actions to
build an inclusive society for all generations in urban communities.
   In rural areas, the proportion of the older population tends to be higher than in urban areas, often as
a result of youth migration to cities [23]. Such out-migration of rural young population is increasingly
common in developed countries, and older residents are often left behind in rural towns [61–64]. In the
case of Japan, the United Kingdom and Ireland, rural residents are experiencing critical declines in
access to basic services, such as grocery stores, post office services and gas stations, due to gradual
withdrawal of service providers from remote areas [65–70]. Closures of basic services primarily affect
local living conditions, particularly of elderly households, and decrease chances for interaction among
community members, which often becomes a driver of social isolation for older residents.
   In the case of developing countries, the types of challenges at the communal level are more diverse
and particular to social contexts. Although the literature is limited, Rittirong et al. (2014) [71] reported
the importance of support by community organizations, such as Buddhist temples or local healthcare
centers, in Thailand. They also pointed out that religion has an important role for the elderly in Thailand,
as they participate in ceremonies at temples on holy days every month and interact with other participants.
Cases of community care are also reported in Taiwan where neighborhood-based communities in cities
may be critical in providing geriatric care for the urban elderly [72]. As social welfare schemes for the
elderly are either not available or may not be fully established, structural responses at the communal


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                     950

level will be a key approach for community-based care for elderly residents. In addition, the notion of
sustainable development will be particularly useful in analyzing diverse and unpredictable population
aging challenges in developing countries. The application of the sustainable development concept allows
a holistic view to investigate hidden challenges, as it explores the economic, environmental and social
dimensions of the target system [73].

4.3. Population Aging at the Individual Level

    Aging is a life course process of individuals. During this process, every person experiences gradual
changes in physical and psychological conditions. The main challenge of population aging at this level
is how to ensure the fulfillment of living conditions for older individuals.
    Regardless of the differences between developed and developing countries, older people tend to be
at higher risk on various occasions in their day-to-day lives. Earlier studies suggest that older people
have higher health risks and a greater possibility of being victims of severe climate events, such as heat
waves [74–76] and hurricanes [77,78]; especially those with chronic diseases are more vulnerable to
these events. In addition, older people are also exposed to greater risks by being trapped in a state of
social exclusion or relative poverty [79–81].
    In terms of the psychological conditions of older people, loneliness and social isolation are two
important concepts that enable better understanding of the state of older people in a society. To begin
with, loneliness is a subjective notion and describes the state of individuals experiencing the loss or
absence of an intimate or needed relationship [80,82], yet it does not necessarily imply the state of an
individual being alone per se. Drennan et al. (2008) [83] concludes that people with a higher degree of
loneliness tend to be: (i) males at the low income level; (ii) those who infrequently communicate
with their children or other family members; and (iii) often those who provide home care for their
spouse or relatives. In contrast, social isolation is an objective notion that describes the actual degree
of connectedness to other individuals or social groups. The condition of being socially isolated is
explained as “the objective state of having minimal contact with other people” [84]. Poor physical
health, low morale and experiencing difficulties in communication and mobility are considered as the
causes of social isolation [85]. As individuals go through different stages of life, they experience
various patterns of losing social relationships that they have built. For example, retirement is a
representative occasion of losing connections that can increase one’s vulnerability not only in financial
terms, but also in social relationships. Deaths of partners, friends and family members are also
symbolic moments that may become a trigger for a greater degree of social isolation.
    Along with general life events, gender appears as the second trigger for social isolation. Older
women often receive a double jeopardy that positions them first as “elderly” and second as “woman”.
In fact, older women tend to be subjected to discrimination in employment, access to daily needs,
ownership of property and even participation in leisure activities [86,87]. Such inequalities in older
woman tend to appear in a rural setting more so due to the required travel distance to services; recent
price increases in energy and food are placing additional pressure on household budgets, and such
situations are generally more difficult to manage for older female residents [66,88]. In addition, in
developing countries, older women tend to have lower educational levels and economic independence;
hence, they tend to be economically dependent on either their husbands or relatives [89,90].


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                     951

   One major challenge regarding loneliness and social isolation of older people exists in the social
perception towards older people. General perceptions of the elderly often have negative connotations, and
they set a strong assumption that “older people are inevitably dependent and a burden on society” [91].
Such stereotypes classify the older population as welfare beneficiaries and underestimate their
contributions to society. In reality, older residents, especially those in their pre-retirement, are often
found as major contributors in caregiving and volunteering and also as active entrepreneurs in local
communities [92–94]. In a society with higher proportions of the elderly, it will be critical to build an
inclusive atmosphere not only for older residents, but also for all generations, recognizing older
residents as active members of society and actively working to prevent loneliness and social isolation.

5. Topics for Future Research

5.1. Population Aging and Sustainable Development

   As discussed in the previous sections, population aging is increasingly becoming a global
phenomenon, and various challenges are predicted across the national, communal and individual
levels. Particularly in developing countries, where both physical infrastructure and social systems are
rapidly evolving, what will be the unique challenges related to aging? More specifically, along with the
challenge in establishing social security systems and ensuring further economic growth at the national
level, what should be the focus of studies on population aging at the communal and individual levels in
the social and cultural contexts of developing countries? To answer these questions, discussing
population aging in line with the concept of sustainable development, which incorporates
intergenerational equity, environmental concerns and social equality dimensions while pursuing
economic development [95–97], would be very helpful, as it provides a holistic view to address
different dimensions of the aging phenomenon.
   To start with, the current development scheme of developing countries does not necessarily address
the demands of the elderly. This is clearly pointed out by Shetty (2012) [98] who argues that there has
been “a massive disconnect between the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and aging”.
Highlighting the looming threat of aging in the coming decades, some international organizations are
calling for global attention to include population aging on the sustainable development agenda [99,100];
however, aging is not included in post-MDG discussions. This may be because of the still very young
population of developing countries. Shetty (2012) [98] pointed out that many developing countries
have made their efforts in dealing with diseases in youth and middle-aged people intensively, which
has led them to achieve longer life expectancies. However, such prioritization of the younger population
has caused a situation that many developing countries are unprepared to meet the needs of the
emerging elderly population [98]. Developing countries need to incorporate aging in their development
agendas, and strategic responses at all levels are required. Moreover, it is critically important to
implement such responses today, as any measures addressing demographic issues require a long time
to observe their effects fully [101].
   Secondly, these responses to population aging should not be limited to policy level discussions on
such topics, such as the sustainability of social security systems; aging in every dimension of society
must be addressed. This is particularly the case for developing countries where the impacts of


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                    952

environmental issues are more acute and the general living conditions of elderly residents are more
affected by rapid social changes [102]. Although there is a great degree of heterogeneity among
developing countries, a few studies reported unsafe living conditions for the elderly. Although the
higher chance of older residents to be crime victims is not confined to developing countries, Veras
(2009) [103] documented that elderly Brazilians have to live with the fear of violence, which reflects
the high crime rate of the country. Somrongthong et al. (2014) [104] report possible dangers related to
housing environments in rural Thailand, such as “lighting and unsafe wires”. Accordingly, social
infrastructure, such as public facilities, transportation and public housing, needs to be designed to be
accessible for all generations, including older residents.
    Thirdly, population aging needs to be examined in relation to other development challenges, because
aging populations will be a predominant condition in most countries in the coming decades. For
example, urbanization is another universal phenomenon; by 2030, more than 60 percent of the global
population will be living in cities, and about 25 percent of them will be aged 60-plus [105]. The
combination of population aging and urbanization is considered as a major demographic challenge of
this century [106]. Despite the abundant studies on population aging and urbanization, respectively, not
much research has examined these two challenges together. A review paper by Phillipson (2004) [107]
listed: (i) elucidating the urban context; (ii) examining the impact of globalization on definitions and
perceptions of place; and (iii) urban ethnography to comprehend the experience of aging within cities,
as agendas for urban aging research. Regarding the urban context, Smith (2009) [108] identified three
factors that prevent older residents from aging well, which are: (i) neighborhood problems, such as
overcrowding, noise and air pollution; (ii) living environment problems; and (iii) perceived city
environment, such as fear of crime and access to high-quality services. Particularly, living environment
problems include practical fears in the daily lives of older people, such as “negotiating hilly and/or
uneven terrain, and worries about being able to sit down whilst out shopping” [109], and access to public
toilets in the city centers [106]. These earlier studies are limited to the case of developed countries.
    As for developing countries, one such challenge related to urbanization pertains to the types of
urban residences. A large-scale migration from rural areas to cities has been taking place due to rapid
urbanization, and significant numbers of these migrants first settle in residential areas with low-income
level households or informal settlements in an urban area. Some of them eventually move to other
parts of the city, whereas the others continue to live in the same areas and become permanent residents.
As those permanent residents become aged, their experiences in an urban settlement would differ
greatly from those of older residents in developed countries. Furthermore, urbanization often holds
diverse environmental challenges in such areas, as water quality, air pollution and waste management.
As urbanization with all its complexities is expected to expand rapidly in developing countries,
further studies are required to examine how environmental challenges affect older people and the local
responses needed.

5.2. Community-Function Decline in Rural Areas: Emerging Topic from the Experience of Japan

   The other expected challenge related to population aging in developing countries is rural declines
induced by the recent rapid urbanization trend. This is because urbanization is largely driven by the


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                  953

migration of young populations, which affects the “age distribution in both sending and receiving
areas” [110].
   In developed countries, rural areas are hollowing out due to the continual out-migration of young
populations, and rural areas are experiencing diverse declines not only in their demographics, but also
in local economies, living environments and social vitality [61,111]. Among those countries that are
experiencing such rural declines, Japan’s experience is particularly drastic.
   In Japan, a large-scale migration of young population to major cities occurred between the late
1950s and the early 1970s during a period of rapid economic growth [112]. Figure 6 illustrates the
changing flow of in-migration of three major city areas in Japan. The peak time for this large-scale
migration was the period of 1955–1960, when about 588,000 people moved to these three metropolitan
areas. Although the size is much smaller, the migration trend to the Tokyo area is still present today,
with around 65,000 people migrating there in 2010 (Figure 6).




      Figure 6. In-migration of three major city areas in Japan from 1955–2010. Note: Created
      from the report on Internal Migration in Japan by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
      Communications. Counted numbers show only Japanese nationality. Area definitions are
      as follows: the Tokyo area includes Chiba, Kanagawa, Tokyo and Saitama prefectures; the
      Nagoya area includes Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures; the Osaka area includes Hyogo,
      Kyoto, Nara and Osaka prefectures.

   Between two National Censuses of 2005 and 2010, 38 out of the country’s 47 prefectures
experienced negative population growth [113]. Especially, five prefectures with the greatest degree of
depopulation (Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Yamagata, Kochi) experienced a four–five percent population
decline annually during this five-year period. As of 2013, the share of older people (aged 65-plus) in
these five prefectures was between 27 and 32 percent, while the national average was at 25.1 percent.
Among them, Akita had the highest share of older people at 31.6 percent. Rural Japan is one of the
areas in the world where the most rapid population aging has happened; therefore, its experience can


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                      954

provide significant insights for rural areas of developing countries where similar patterns of rural
decline are predicted due to the rapid urbanization experience.
    One clear impact of population aging can be found in the declining community vitality in rural
areas. Though it is a relatively new concept and does not have a universal definition, community vitality
is seen as “the ability of a community to sustain itself into the future as well as provide opportunities
for its residents to pursue their own life goals and the ability of residents to experience positive life
outcomes” [114]. This concept is close to the notion of ‘community-function’ developed by Japanese
scholars in rural studies. In rural Japan, residents form neighborhood-based social relationships for the
activities that are essential for maintaining their livelihood and local environment. These collective
actions are recognized as a set of functions, called “community-function” (originally “shurakukino” in
Japanese), that each rural community has ([115], pp. 73–76; [116–120]). Although there is no established
set of indicators for its measurement, earlier studies suggest that the collective actions of residents are
critical for sustaining community-function. For example, collective actions of residents in farming and
forestry, maintenance of living environments and local events, such as seasonal festivals and traditional
performing arts, are considered as key activities to determine the quality of community-function.
    Community-function is a useful notion for understanding the self-managing capacity of a rural
community, and its decline implies the weakening of community vitality. As a result of continued
outflow of young people and the aging of residents, rural communities are experiencing drastic
declines in community-function, and further declines are seen as possible threats to the sustainability
of rural communities [121].
    Rural studies in Japan examined the actual changes that residents experience during the declining
process of community-function. They claim residents face a wide range of challenges in their living
conditions in such aspects as transportation and access to basic services [69,122], management of vacant
houses and community facilities [56,123,124] and abandonment of farmlands and communal forests
due to aging of farmers and lack of successors [125,126].
    The succession of traditional knowledge is another concern during the rural decline process, as it
has been the main body of knowledge about the interaction between nature and society based on the
regular observation of the local environment, which looks at patterns of natural cycles including
crises [127,128]. Traditional knowledge is also linked to local beliefs and understanding of place that
are critical to the identity formation of local people. The case of rural Japan illustrates a severe
situation regarding traditional knowledge transfer over generations as older residents practically cannot
transfer their knowledge to younger generations since there are fewer young people in their
communities. Additionally, even if some young people remain in rural communities, many of them are
not engaged with farming, which is a key intermediary between nature and society. This situation
makes learning specific types of traditional knowledge, which they can only acquire through direct
observations and experiences with nature, much more difficult.
    The main challenge for rural decline is to find a sustainable approach to reinvigorating the declining
community-function and to create new functions to respond to emerging challenges. Fulfillment of
declining functions may be achieved by merging a number of rural communities to keep the critical mass
for maintaining the minimum size and quality of community-function. This initial phase of response
aims at securing the living conditions of rural residents. Yet, at the same time, it would be critical for
rural communities to be open to the external infusion of knowledge. New knowledge from outside may


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                       955

revitalize the traditional knowledge to preserve declining community-function or add novel functions
addressing new local challenges. In fact, the demands of residents are likely to change, as there is a
higher share of older residents in a community. Further case studies are required to identify the role of
traditional and new knowledge during the process of population aging in rural communities.
   Considering the larger scale of urbanization and population aging, a faster pace of rural decline is
expected in developing countries. For example, Gautam (2008) [129] reported the living conditions of
elderly residents in Nepal, noting that they are largely left alone in rural villages and feel helplessness,
loneliness and frustration even though they receive financial support from their out-migrated children
who are making their own livings in cities. Flahety et al. (2007) [54] also claim that the recent trend of
rural-to-urban migration may interfere with the traditional networks of children to provide care for the
elderly, as they are physically distant from their home. Although the same degree of population aging
as Japan may not be observed, studies on rural decline, especially in terms of community-function and
traditional knowledge, will be critical for developing countries.

6. Conclusions

   This paper reviewed the population aging trends in world and regional demography. The world
demography is rapidly shifting to an era of population aging. This point has been confirmed by the
increasing share and actual size of the aged 60-plus populations, both in developed and developing
regions. Although Europe will remain the most aged region in terms of the share of older people,
population projections suggest that population aging will be intensified in Asia, Latin America and
Africa in terms of the total number of elderly. The declining fertility rate and the increasing life
expectancies both at birth and at older ages are identified as the demographic causes for the population
aging trend in the world. The acceleration of population aging in the selected countries was also
reviewed in terms of three aging transitions. Although Europe and Northern American will go through
these transitions over relatively longer periods of time than Asian and Latin American countries,
the second and the third transitions are predicted to occur rapidly in all countries. In general,
the number of years taken or predicted to take for these transitions is decreasing as countries move to
later transitions in the future.
   Three levels—(i) the national; (ii) the communal; and (iii) the individual levels—are applied to
structurally analyze the expected challenges related to population aging both in developed and
developing countries. At the national level, the increasing financial pressure to sustain current systems
due to the increasing proportion of older people is a major concern, especially in developed countries.
As for developing countries, where welfare schemes are not fully established, the main challenge will
be to meet the medical and other needs of the growing older population. The case of China highlights a
shortage of care facilities and geriatric care workers. Though the size and speed of population aging
differ among developing countries, the development of socioeconomic systems to ensure economic
security for the elderly will be a common challenge. At the communal level, challenges both in urban
and rural areas are discussed for developed countries. In urban areas, challenges are linked to the
physical changes of cities, such as shrinking cities or abandonment of facilities, whereas the challenges
in rural areas are more directly related to residents’ living conditions, such as the accessibility of basic
services. As for developing countries, the types of challenges at the communal level are expected


Soc. Sci. 2015, 4                                                                                      956

to be more diverse and particular to social contexts. The case of Thailand suggests that community
organizations, such as Buddhist temples and local healthcare centers, play an important role in enhancing
the well-being of the elderly. Another case of community care in Taiwan also suggested the importance
of healthcare services at this level. At the individual level, the concepts of loneliness and social
isolation are reviewed. Possible approaches are linked to initiatives at the communal level, which aim
at increasing the social participation of older people. Gender dimensions are also briefly mentioned as
an additional trigger for social isolation. In the case of developing countries, gender appears to be a
more distinctive issue in educational attainment levels and economic dependency.
    Finally, two topics are suggested for future research on population aging. The first topic is about the
need to link population aging challenges with sustainable development. With the knowledge that the
size of the older population will increase drastically in developing regions, population aging should be
discussed in the context of other development challenges. Urbanization is raised as a possible topic
that has a significant linkage to population aging. As more than 60 percent of the global population
will live in cities by 2030, it is urgent to address sustainable development issues of elderly residents in
urban settlements, particularly in developing countries. In fact, WHO (2007) [106] suggests the
combination of aging and urbanization is a major demographic challenge of this century.
    The second topic is about rural declines caused by the extensive out-migration of the young
population as part of a recent rapid urbanization trend. Japan’s experience of rural decline is presented
to illustrate possible challenges in rural aging communities. The problems of rural decline both in
terms of tangible aspects, such as access to basic services, management of local properties and public
transportation, and intangible aspects, such as succession of traditional knowledge among generations,
are introduced. Furthermore, the concept of community-function from Japanese rural studies is
introduced as a useful notion for understanding the self-managing capacity of rural communities.
Considering the strong presence of urbanization and accelerating population aging, a similar pattern of
rural decline may occur in rapidly-aging developing countries.
    Given the anticipated impacts of population aging, the authors call for future studies on population
aging in developing countries. One effective approach would be a series of comparative studies
between the countries that have been experiencing rapid population aging, such as Japan, Korea and
Singapore, and the other countries in which a rapid acceleration of population aging is expected in the
coming decades. Analysis in these studies should be conducted across the national, communal and
individual levels. Among them, the communal level should be emphasized, as local and autonomous
initiatives will be a critical measure in responding to diverse development challenges. Further studies
to create a body of knowledge on population aging in developing countries will help in placing
population aging on the agenda of future sustainable development discussions.
