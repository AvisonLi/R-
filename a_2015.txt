                                          In Memory of Dr. Richard M. Suzman

                     The Population Division of the U.S. Census Bureau wishes to express our deep
                     gratitude and pay tribute to Dr. Richard M. Suzman, director of Division of
                     Behavioral and Social Research, National Institute on Aging, who passed away
                     on April 16, 2015. A pioneer and champion for the science of population aging,
                     Dr. Suzman played a critical role in developing the aging research program in the
                     Population Division. For over three decades he steadfastly supported numerous
                     Census Bureau publications focused on population aging trends and demographic,
                     socioeconomic, and health characteristics of the older populations in the United
                     States and the world. Enormously popular report series such as 65+ in the United
                     States and An Aging World are a remarkable testimony to Dr. Suzman’s dedication
                     to research on population aging which, in his words, is reshaping our world.



                  This report was prepared by Wan He and Daniel Goodkind of the U.S. Census Bureau,

   Population Projections Data in This Report
   Throughout this report, projections of population size and composition come from the Population Division
   of the Census Bureau, unless otherwise indicated. As discussed further in Appendix C, these projections are
   based on demographic analysis for each nation, including their population age and sex structures, compo-
   nents of population change (rates of fertility, mortality, and net migration), and assumptions about the future
   trajectories of population change.
   Projections for countries are updated periodically as new data become available. Therefore, the data in this
   report are not the latest available for every country and, by extension, for groups of countries aggregated
   into regions. The impact of projection updates on indicators of population aging is generally modest and has
   little effect on the overall trends described in this report.
   Population projections for the United States in this report come from the Census Bureau National Projections
   Data, current as of December 2014. Users may find the latest population figures for the United States at
   <www.census.gov/population/projections/data/national/2014.html>. The population projections for all
   other countries were current as of December 2013 and were drawn from the Census Bureau’s International
   Data Base. The latest projections for countries of the world are available at <www.census.gov/population
   /international/data/idb/informationGateway.php>.

   Demographic Transition and Population Aging
   The classical model of demographic transition refers to the process where a society starts with extremely
   high levels of both fertility and mortality and transitions to a point where both rates are low and stable. The
   demographic transition impacts both the population growth rate and the age structure of a country.

   The demographic transition consists of four stages. At the start—Stage 1, both birth rates and death rates
   are high. The natural increase (births minus deaths) is low, the population increases very slowly, and the
   country’s age structure is young with a pyramid shape of a large number of children at the base and very
   few older people at the top. In Stage 2, mortality, especially infant and child mortality, declines rapidly while
   fertility lags and remains high. In this stage, population increases rapidly and the age structure becomes
   younger. However, the proportion of the older population starts to grow as mortality rates decrease and
   people live longer. In Stage 3, a fertility transition occurs as fertility declines rapidly, accompanied by con-
   tinued yet slower declines in infant and child mortality, but accelerated mortality decline at older ages. The
   population continues to grow; however, the age structure becomes even older as life expectancy continues to
   improve. In Stage 4, both mortality and fertility are low and remain relatively stable, population growth flat-
   tens, and the age structure becomes old. No longer is there a wide base of young children and a small tip at
   the top for the older population; the shape of the age structure becomes almost rectangular.

   Many factors contribute to this process, but it is generally agreed that the initial momentum starts with
   improvement in public health, including basic sanitation and advancements in medicine. The increased child
   survival rates, along with general improvements in socioeconomic conditions, then affect fertility behavior
   through a reduction in the desired number of children. Economic explanations for a lower desired number
   of children include mechanization of agriculture and expansion of the nonagrarian economy; the quantity-
   quality tradeoff, that parents switch their resources from raising many offspring to a smaller number of “qual-
   ity” children; and the opportunity cost for women to have children versus their own labor force participation
   (Canning, 2011; Galor, 2012).

   Countries vary in the timing of the onset and duration of the stages of the demographic transition. The more
   developed countries, especially those in Western and Northern Europe, started the demographic transition
   more than a century ago and most took many decades to complete this process. Less developed countries in
   Asia and Latin America started this process only in recent decades, and for most of these countries, the tran-
   sition is proceeding more quickly. A number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are proceeding slowly through
   the fertility transition or in some cases experiencing a stall in fertility decline (Bongaarts, 2008). Researchers
   point to several possible explanations for the delays in fertility decline in parts of Africa, including slow
   economic development, limited improvement in female access to education, and increases in mortality due to
   the AIDS epidemic (Bongaarts, 2008; Ezeh, Mberu, and Emina, 2009). On the other hand, Bangladesh serves
   as an example of a country achieving major reductions in fertility from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s
   despite low levels of economic development (Cleland, et al., 1994; Khuda and Hossain, 1996).

  Doubling of the Share of Older Population, or Is it Tripling?
  A commonly used indicator for the speed of population aging is the number of years for a country’s popula-
  tion aged 65 and over to double from 7 percent of the total population to 14 percent. It is often noted that
  it took France 115 years for its share of older population to achieve this doubling, and many European and
  Northern American countries waited more than half a century for this doubling to complete—Sweden, 85 years;
  Australia, 73 years; and the United States, 69 years (Figure 2-7). Japan is an exception among the more devel-
  oped countries. It took Japan only 25 years (1970 to 1995) to have its older population double from 7 percent
  to 14 percent of its total population.
  While most of the more developed countries have already completed this doubling, the less developed coun-
  tries, especially those in Asia and Latin America, started this process in the 21st century and are moving at a
  much faster speed. That the doubling may take only a couple of decades in China and many other Asian and
  Latin American countries raises serious concerns in these countries regarding their readiness to deal with a rap-
  idly aging society. As the Director-General of the World Health Organization pointed out at the United Nation’s
  Second World Assembly on Ageing in 2002, “We must be aware that the developed countries became rich
  before they became old, the developing countries will become old before they become rich” (Butler, 2002).
  In the near future, countries may face not just doubling but tripling of the share of the older population from
  7 percent to 21 percent of the total population. Japan, the oldest country in the world, achieved its tripling in
  2007, and today’s older Japanese represent about 27 percent of the total population. Projections show that by
  2030, a short 15 years from now, the majority of European countries (32 out of 42) will have completed this
  tripling.
  The tripling will take place in some rapidly aging Asian and Latin American countries at an accelerated pace.
  South Korea, for example, is projected to take just 18 years for its older population to double from 7 percent to
  14 percent, and half that time (9 years) to reach 21 percent. Chile’s doubling will take 26 years and just another
  16 years to complete the tripling.

  Box 3-1.
  China's One-Child Policy and Population Aging
  In the early 1970s, China began to institute fertility restrictions out of concern that rapid population growth
  would derail its development. A group of policies known as “later-longer-fewer” was designed to encourage
  delayed childbearing after marriage, longer intervals between births, and fewer births overall. Under these
  policies, China’s fertility fell dramatically from over 5 births per woman in 1972 to under 3 by 1977, the fast-
  est decline ever recorded, although declines varied by province (Tien, 1984).
  China introduced an even stricter policy in 1979 requiring most parents to have only one child. In 1984, due
  to strong son preference, most rural couples with a first-born daughter were permitted to have a second
  child. In 1991, China’s fertility fell below 2 children per woman, and since 2000 it has hovered around 1.5
  (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013).
  What effect have China’s birth planning policies had on population structure and aging? Experts seem unani-
  mous in concluding that the “later-longer-fewer” campaign of the 1970s resulted in faster fertility declines
  than would have occurred in the absence of these policies. The exact impact depends on counterfactual
  assumptions of what policies might have otherwise been in place as well as the pattern of fertility decline
  that might have occurred under them (Goodkind, 1992; Wang, Cai, and Gu, 2012).
  Opinions are more divided about the extent to which birth restrictions are responsible for the pace of China’s
  fertility decline from the 1980s forward. Many experts in recent years argue that China’s fertility is very low
  due primarily to improved socioeconomic conditions and that fertility restrictions are increasingly irrelevant
  for childbearing decisions (e.g., Cai, 2010).
  Whatever the exact number of averted births, the impact of low fertility on China’s population may be
  understood by looking at its age-sex pyramids in 2015 and 2050 (Figure 3-2). The size of each birth cohort
  is determined by two factors—fertility rates at the time of birth and the number of females at childbearing
  ages. The notable constriction of the 2015 population pyramid for the age groups 30 to 34 and 35 to 39
  corresponds to the cohort born during the “later-longer-fewer” era of the 1970s and after the one-child policy
  was instituted in 1979. The subsequent enlargement of younger cohorts (peaking at ages 25–29) is an “echo”
  of the large number of females born in the late 1960s, which likely counterbalanced the reduction in fertility
  caused by the one-child policy.
  In 2050, the population pyramid reflects the longer term effects of China’s declining fertility. The echo
  generation will be approaching older ages (60 to 64). Age groups older than 60 will likely form a heavy top
  for China’s age distribution. As the smaller birth cohorts of the 1990s and 2000s reach prime working ages,
  China will experience a shrinking labor force. By 2050, the population in the primary working ages, 20 to 59,
  is projected to represent only 46.5 percent of the total population, down from the peak of 61.6 percent in
  2011.
  Note: The primary working ages 20 to 59 are used in this discussion because China’s mandatory retirement ages for the majority of salaried
  workers are 60 for men and 55 for women, except for government officials or workers in heavy or hazardous industries.

  Support of Childless Older People in an Aging Europe
  By Martina Brandt, TU Dortmund University, and Christian Deindl, University of Cologne

  Western societies tend to have the highest proportion of older people (Kinsella and He, 2009) and are facing
  considerable pressure on pension and health systems, including services and financial resources for old age care
  (Börsch-Supan and Ludwig, 2010). An important aspect for old age support is who will provide the care, especially

20 An Aging World: 2015                                                                                                     U.S. Census Bureau


   for those who are very old and have no partners. Traditionally, children are the mainstay of old age support, espe-
   cially when only one parent is still living. However, people are not only living longer but also having fewer children,
   with rising childlessness among the older people (Albertini and Mencarini, 2014; Hayford, 2013; Rowland, 2007).

   Thus new challenges arise: Who will provide help and care to the childless older people? On what support networks
   can they rely? And, what role does the state play in care provision?

   Today about 10 percent of the population aged 50 and over in Europe are childless, according to data from the
   Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (see Börsch-Supan et al., 2011 for details), ranging from 5 to
   15 percent in individual countries (Figure 3-5; also see Hank and Wagner, 2013). Childless elders in this study are
   defined as those who never had any children and those who have outlived their children (3 percent of the childless
   people aged 50 and older).

   Family and intergenerational relations play an important role for support in old age. Older parents in need typically
   receive the most help from their children. In the absence of children, vital support for older persons has been taken
   over by public providers in many countries in Europe. In countries with low social service provision such as Italy,
   Spain, and Poland, older people are thus likely to experience a lack of help (Deindl and Brandt, 2011), especially
   when childless and dependent on care. Childless elders also often receive care by extended family, friends, and
   neighbors (Deindl and Brandt, 2014).

   Compared with those who have children, childless older people in need of care (with at least one limitation in
   instrumental activities of daily living) are more likely to receive any support (Figure 3-6). With regard to the type
   of support (formal, informal, or
   both), childless older people are
   more likely than their counterparts          Figure 3-6.

   Early Life Conditions and Older Adult Health
   By Mary C. McEniry, University of Wisconsin-Madison

   Adult health, disease, and mortality in later life are influenced by early life factors (Barker, 1998; Crimmins
   and Finch, 2006; Smith et al., 1998). Research also supports the influence of the social determinants of
   health and socioeconomic conditions on health outcomes later in life (Marmot and Wilkinson, 2005; Almond
   and Currie, 2010). These findings demonstrate the importance of a life-course approach to understanding
   older adult health. This life-course approach has expanded our understanding of modern shifts in life expec-
   tancy in diverse settings.

   The intriguing links between early life adversities and later life health can be examined through the rapid
   mortality declines during the 1930s to the 1960s in less developed countries (Palloni, Pinto-Aguirre, and
   Pelaez, 2002). During this period, less developed countries experienced significant reductions in infant and
   child mortality triggered by the medical and public health revolution (Preston, 1976). However, adults born
   during these 4 decades were still exposed to poor socioeconomic conditions, poor nutrition, and infectious
   diseases as infants and children. Exposure to these conditions in early life can increase the risk of poor health
   at older ages and, in particular, increase the risk of adult diabetes, obesity, and heart disease (Barker, 1998;
   Elo and Preston, 1992; Lillycrop et al., 2014; Tarry-Adkins and Ozanne, 2014).

   Cohorts increasingly characterized by their exposure to and survivorship of poor early life conditions may be
   at higher risk of poor health at older ages, especially for diseases known to originate in early life. The pro-
   jected large increases in adult health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, may well have
   their origins in the past (Murray and López, 1996; Hossain, Kawar, and El Nahas, 2007). These circumstances
   may also have important implications for older adult health for at least the next 20 to 30 years (Palloni,
   Pinto-Aguirre, and Pelaez, 2002).

   The timing of rapid mortality decline was different across countries for the birth cohorts of the 1930s to
   1960s. The present-day middle-income countries, such as Costa Rica, experienced rapid mortality reductions
   in the 1930s and 1940s, whereas several of today’s low-income countries did not experience significant mor-
   tality changes until the 1950s and 1960s. If early life events indeed have large impacts on adult health, and if
   differences in timing and pace of mortality decline created cohorts with markedly different health patterns in
   later life, then differences in health patterns for adults aged 60 and over should appear.

   A newly compiled data set contains harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from major surveys of
   older adults or households in 20 countries and areas in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as England,
   the Netherlands, and the United States (McEniry, 2013). The countries contributing data are diverse in their
   patterns of mortality decline and early life nutrition and infectious disease environments during the 1930s
   to the 1960s. The data set includes both very poor and wealthier countries and areas in the 1930s, including
   those that saw their economic status rise over time (e.g., Barbados, Puerto Rico, and Taiwan) and their aver-
   age caloric intake increase (China, Costa Rica, Mexico, and others) (Table 4-4).

   These data reveal health patterns in older adults born during periods of rapid demographic changes, par-
   ticularly for adult diabetes in the cohort born in the 1930s and 1940s. Figure 4-7 compares country-specific
   prevalence of self-reported diabetes for these older adults surveyed in the 2000s with country-level per-
   capita daily caloric intake in the 1930s and 1940s during their childhood. A high prevalence of adult diabetes
   is found for those born in very poor caloric intake countries that experienced significant and rapid mortality
   decline in the 1940s (countries labeled C and D in Figure 4-7). The prevalence is higher than for those born in
                                                                                            Continued on next page.

  countries that experienced a more gradual mortality decline (countries labeled A and B), or countries that did
  not experience significant mortality decline (countries labeled E). Being born into a country that experienced
  rapidly increasing life expectancy during the 1940s (labeled C and D) increased the odds of adult diabetes by
  61 percent to 72 percent and of adult obesity by 46 percent to 53 percent (McEniry, 2014). Even though the
  numbers in the graph for diabetes are self-reported and are probably underestimated, especially for low- and
  middle-income countries, the prevalence of diabetes in C and D countries is higher now than what appeared
  historically in more developed countries (labeled A) (Wilkerson and Krall, 1947; Gordon, 1964; García-Palmieri
  et al., 1970; Hadden and Harris, 1987; Harris et al., 1998). With more accurate information about the preva-
  lence of diabetes, the steepness of the line would most likely increase, suggesting a larger contrast between
  middle- and high-income countries. The rapid demographic changes between the 1930s and the 1960s may
  help explain these health patterns and predict what is to come for adults in low-income countries born in the
  1950s and 1960s.

  Two avenues of research hold promise in further examining early life conditions and older adult health. The
  epigenetic basis for disease may lead to developing future therapeutic approaches to prevent or address dis-
  ease. Epigenetic patterns may also provide clearer evidence about lifetime health risks resulting from expo-
  sures that occur in utero and in childhood (Horvath, 2013; Lillycrop et al., 2014). On the other hand, emerg-
  ing interest in using genomic data with social science survey data may provide a better understanding of how
  genes and early life environment combine to influence adult health. Recent evidence shows that poor early
  life conditions can impact gene expression at older ages (Levine et al., 2015). Both research avenues have the
  potential to lead to informed health policy that benefits those exposed to poor early life conditions.

  The Rising Tide of Aging With HIV
  By Joel Negin and Robert Cumming, University of Sydney

  The HIV pandemic has had a profound impact across the world. In 2013, an estimated 35 million people
  were living with HIV and the global response to the epidemic has been unprecedented in terms of funding,
  attention, and action (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2014). Despite considerable progress,
  important gaps remain in the global HIV response. Older adults have long been neglected despite important
  evidence of the growing impact among those aged 50 and older in both developing and developed countries
  (Mills, Barnighausen, and Negin, 2012).

  As of 2013, more than one-third of those living with HIV in North America and Western Europe were aged
  50 and older (Mahy et al., 2014; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2014). In Latin America, 15.4
  percent of those living with HIV were in this age group and in Sub-Saharan Africa—the region most affected
  by HIV—almost 12 percent were aged 50 and over (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2014). The
  numbers are increasing, with a dramatic rise in those aged 50 and older living with HIV in all regions of the
  world (Figure 4-9). In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are already more than 2.5 million adults aged 50 and over
  living with HIV.

  This rapid increase in the HIV burden among older adults can be attributed to a number of factors.
  Principally, the 13 million people accessing anti-retroviral treatment are living longer with life expectancies
  returning to near normal in most countries (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2014; Mills et al.,
  2011). Therefore, many individuals are now aging with HIV into their 50s and beyond. In addition, older
  adults remain sexually active and condom use among those aged 50 and over remains low, thus putting
  these individuals at risk of HIV transmission (Drew and Sherrard, 2008; Freeman and Anglewicz, 2012). In
  general, older adults have lower levels of HIV-related knowledge than younger adults (Figure 4-10). Lack of
  knowledge works to impede preventative actions and, as a result, contributes to emerging evidence of new
  HIV infection among older adults (Wallrauch, Barnighausen, and Newell, 2010).

  Lower levels of HIV-related knowledge and HIV testing among older adults not only have implications for HIV
  transmission, but for HIV treatment as well. Those aged 50 and older have smaller CD4+ T-cell gains while on
  treatment (Vinikoor et al., 2014). They also have poorer therapy outcomes than younger adults (Bakanda et
  al., 2011; Negin et al., 2011b).

  The emergence of multimorbidity is a further challenge for HIV care as a result of living longer with HIV. Aging
  with HIV means older individuals often have the additional burden of multiple chronic health conditions. Older
  people living with HIV have high rates of kidney disease, cognitive impairment, and metabolic abnormalities
  (Calvo and Martinez, 2014; Cysique and Brew, 2014; Nadkarni, Konstantinidis, and Wyatt, 2014). There is
  ongoing debate whether claims of accelerated aging as a result of HIV and its treatment have been overstated
  (Justice and Falutz, 2014). However, there is evidence from South Africa that those living with HIV have mark-
  ers of accelerated aging—reduced telomere length and CD2NKA expression—when compared to HIV-negative
  individuals (Pathai et al., 2013). Prevention, testing, and treatment services targeted at older adults and
  designed appropriately will help ensure an inclusive response to the continuing HIV epidemic.

  Epigenetics of Aging
  By Kirstin N. Sterner, University of Oregon

  Most health outcomes associated with aging result from a complex interplay of an individual’s genome and
  life experiences. Life experiences and environmental factors influence the expression of complex genetic
  traits, making it difficult to identify specific genetic markers that can be used to slow aging or unambigu-
  ously diagnose, treat, or prevent aging-related diseases. The epigenome helps mediate these gene-environ-
  ment interactions and, therefore, has the potential to provide insights into aging and disease processes.

  Life experiences, such as stress, nutrition, and environmental exposure, can affect the genome through “epi-
  genetic modifications,” which are biochemical alterations of the genome and chromatin that make specific
  regions of the genome more or less accessible to the cell’s transcriptional machinery without changing the
  underlying DNA sequence itself. The results of these biochemical modifications are changes in gene expres-
  sion (when genes are turned on/off and the quantity of gene product made). Unlike the genome, the epig-
  enome can be dynamic and flexible, and varies across tissue/cell types and the lifespan.

  One of the most commonly studied forms of epigenetic modification is DNA methylation. In DNA methyla-
  tion, a methyl group is added to a cytosine in the genome sequence by DNA methyltransferases. A modified
  cytosine is typically followed by a guanine, forming a “CpG” site. DNA methylation typically reduces gene
  expression. During the normal aging process, there is an overall reduction in DNA methylation across the
  genome, although increases have been observed in more localized regions (D’Aquila et al., 2013). This raises
  the question of whether DNA methylation status can be used as a biomarker of aging and aging-related
  diseases.

  A number of recent studies have identified epigenetic markers associated with common aging-related dis-
  eases, including Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, and cancers, although the significance of these findings
  is unclear (Kanherkar, Bhatiq-Dey, and Csoka, 2014; Jung and Pfeifer, 2015). In addition, some epigenetically
  modified CpG sites predict age in specific tissues and across tissue and cell types (Hannum et al., 2013;
  Horvath, 2013). These sites behave in a clocklike manner, with a higher rate of methylation early in life that
  slows after adulthood and can be used to estimate an individual’s methylation age (Horvath et al., 2014). In
  most cases, methylation age and true chronological age are highly correlated. When methylation age and
  chronological age differ, it may suggest acceleration or deceleration of aging (see note).

  There is a growing interest in identifying lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors that are associated with
  age acceleration to better understand aging-related diseases. While use of epigenetic data and the epigen-
  etic clock is relatively new to aging-research, a number of recent studies hint at its potential. For instance,
  methylation age acceleration is associated with decreased lung function, grip strength, and cognition and
  increased all-cause mortality (Marioni et al., 2015a; Marioni et al., 2015b). Horvath (2013) used the epigen-
  etic clock to identify evidence of age acceleration in liver tissue, adipose tissue, muscle, and blood. A study
  of German patients found a strong correlation between body mass index (BMI) and liver disease, and between
  BMI and age acceleration (Horvath et al., 2014; Figure 4-13). Age acceleration was defined as the residual
  resulting from the regression of methylation age on chronological age. Further research is needed to deter-
  mine: 1) the molecular mechanisms that underlie age acceleration; 2) how divergent patterns of methylation
  influence health outcomes associated with aging; and, 3) how the epigenome changes throughout an indi-
  vidual’s lifetime.

             Note: Age acceleration is when someone’s epigenetic age, as measured overall or in particular body parts like the liver, is deemed
             to be older than chronological age. BMI is body mass index. The dashed line indicates the regression line and data point
             corresponds to a human subject. Age acceleration in liver tissue is significantly correlated with BMI (r=0.42, P=6.8X10-4).

  Global Aging and Minority Populations: Healthcare Access, Quality of Care, and Use
  of Services
  By Karen I. Fredriksen-Goldsen, University of Washington

  In addition to the common concerns about aging, older adults from minority and migrant groups face addi-
  tional worries about support and access to services as they age. Barriers and discrimination at many levels
  may impact access to needed services for themselves or loved ones, formal financial arrangements and secu-
  rity, and physical accommodation in older age. The impact of discrimination and ongoing disadvantage over
  a lifetime are borne out by recent numbers: lower life expectancies and higher disease burdens.

  Despite recent attention, the gaps in life expectancy and other indicators are not closing, for instance, in
  indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and for those with lower levels of educa-
  tion (Olshansky et al., 2012; Mitrou et al., 2014). The variations in health often reflect differences by group
  status such as race, ethnicity, immigration, socioeconomic status, sexual and gender identities, and physical
  and mental abilities (National Institutes of Health, 2013). This is likely compounded by additional language,
  linguistic, and cultural barriers (Warnes et al, 2004; Bramley et al., 2005; Sayegh and Knight, 2013). Among
  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older adults, experiences of discrimination and victimization
  are linked to poor health outcomes, yet they often experience barriers to accessing care and remain largely
  invisible in services given their stigmatized identities (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2011; Fredriksen-Goldsen
  et al., 2013). Among those with intellectual, emotional, and physical disabilities, adjustments in healthcare
  information are often needed to better match capacity (Emerson et al., 2011).

  Health inequities, resulting from economic, environmental, and social disadvantage, are costly. In the United
  States, where the 65-and-older population has nearly complete health care coverage by Medicare, it is
  estimated that among Blacks, Hispanics, and Asian Americans, nearly one-third of direct healthcare expen-
  ditures are excess costs as a result of health inequities (LaVeist, Gaskin, and Richard, 2009). Furthermore,
  when examining differences in health care quality in the United States, those living in poverty, compared to
  those with high incomes, received worse care for 47 percent of the quality measures; people aged 65 and
  older received worse care for 39 percent of the quality measures compared to adults aged 18 to 44 (Figure
  5-1; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2012). There were also significant differences by race and
  ethnicity. Ensuring appropriate access to and use of care and quality care are critical factors in the promotion
  of health, especially for racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous and aboriginal people, immigrants, LGBT
  people, as well as those with intellectual, emotional, and physical disabilities.

  Across population groups, several factors have been linked to inequities in health, including the heightened
  risk of exposure to social determinants of poor health (such as poverty, unemployment, isolation, and dis-
  crimination) and other structural and organizational barriers, including lack of available services and institu-
  tional and societal biases in services as well as policies (Braveman, Egerter, and Williams, 2011). In addition,
  older adults from these population groups may be at elevated risk of adverse health behaviors as well as at
  risk of reduced health literacy. They may also be reluctant to utilize healthcare services, preventative screen-
  ings, and other health promotion activities. Promoting health equity, embedded within a life course perspec-
  tive, is critical for older adults across diverse population groups to have the capacity to reach their full health
  potential (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2014).

                                                                                              Continued on next page.

  Box 5-2.
  Social Networks and Health Care Utilization
  In recent years, a wide range of technological innovations, such as robot nurses and telemedicine, has been
  developed in the United States, Europe, and Asia, to help care for older people (Economist Intelligence Unit,
  2009). While technology will undoubtedly play an increasing role in future health care systems, social interac-
  tions and relationships remain one of the drivers of health, behaviours, and health care utilization worldwide.

  Social interactions and networks influence a wide range of behaviours and decisions in life, including some
  impacting health that are quite remarkable—from recovery after a heart attack and susceptibility to the
  common cold, to the dynamic spread of negative (smoking and obesity) and positive (happiness) factors for
  health (Berkman, Leo-Summer, and Horwitz, 1992; Cohen et al., 1997; Christakis and Fowler, 2007; Christakis
  and Fowler, 2008; Fowler and Christakis, 2008). Social integration also plays a considerable role in preserv-
  ing memory as we age (Ertel, Glymour, and Berkman, 2008; Wang, He, and Dong, 2015).

  Equally astonishing are recent findings about the role of social connectedness in disease pathways: experi-
  mentally induced inflammation in otherwise healthy women and men contributed to greater increases in
  depressed mood and feelings of social disconnection among women—suggesting a better understanding of
  sex differences in depression prevalence and a possible avenue for interventions (Moieni et al., 2015). One
  such health promoting intervention had a positive impact on social support and healthy lifestyle in a small
  sample of adults aged 60 to 73 in Tehran (Foroushani et al., 2014), and multiple interventions to reduce
  loneliness in older adults show promise (Cohen-Mansfield and Perach, 2015).

  Social isolation, on the other hand, has been shown to be detrimental to health in older adults, including
  higher all-cause mortality risk (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, and Layton, 2010; Shankar et al., 2011; Steptoe et al.,
  2013). In another cohort of older community-dwelling adults, lack of social activity was associated with dis-
  ability (James et al., 2011). Similarly, some social relationships have the potential for a health damaging effect
  in older adults (Seeman, 2000).

  Social relationships are critical for well-being in older adults and are also central to health maintenance over
  the life course. Reaching older age in better health, partly as a result of strong positive social relationships,
  would decrease health service needs and demands, yet the direct evidence behind the peer effect of social
  networks on health care utilization in older age is sparse (Wang, He, and Dong, 2015). Researchers in the
  United States showed how social relationships influenced the prevalence of having visited a dentist (Watt et
  al., 2014) and a significant association with health service demand (Wang, He, and Dong, 2015). A study in
  Canada found that social networks influence health care utilization through two main channels—sharing of
  information and social norms (Deri, 2005). How this extends to older people in lower income countries and
  the impact of social media remains to be determined.

  One challenge for all countries will be to identify an etiologic period clearly enough to know when to inter-
  vene. The follow-on challenge is how to construct an intervention in something as inherently complicated as
  social networks over a lifetime.

  Impact of the Great Recession on the Older Population
  World markets experienced a general economic decline during the 2007 to 2009 period. While only a portion of
  the world’s countries saw negative growth rates for gross domestic product (GDP) during this time, many other
  countries faced slowdowns in their economic growth. In the United States, for example, a recession officially
  began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Nearly all member countries of the European Union also went
  into recession around the same time. China and India, on the other hand, did not enter recession but did experi-
  ence slowing economic growth (Bernanke, 2009). In addition, countries whose economies were less integrated
  with the world economy through trade or financial markets, such as many countries in Africa, were less directly
  affected. The International Monetary Fund estimated that real world GDP per capita (in purchasing power parity
  terms) declined in 2009 and stated that the world economy was experiencing a “Great Recession” more severe
  than at any time since the end of World War II (International Monetary Fund, 2009).

  The recession originated in the United States after a sharp decline in housing prices triggered defaults on sub-
  prime mortgages, the financial fallout from which spread to other parts of the world (International Monetary Fund,
  2009). The recession was characterized by rising unemployment as well as falling prices of housing, commodi-
  ties, and other investments. To what extent did the recession affect the older population and have any effects
  lingered?

  The unemployment rates over the 2000 to 2013 period for four countries—Portugal, South Korea, United
  Kingdom, and United States—help illustrate the diverse impact of the Great Recession (Figure 6-11).
  Unemployment in the United States at ages 65 and over more than doubled between 2006 and 2010—from 2.9
  to 6.7 percent, an increase of nearly 4 percentage points—before starting a slow decline and reaching 5.3 percent
  in 2013. The older labor force in South Korea and Portugal also saw a rise in unemployment levels following 2006
  but at levels below those of the United States. However, while the unemployment rate peaked in 2010 for South
  Korea, the peak did not occur until 2012 in Portugal. In the United Kingdom, unemployment rates fluctuated
  around 2 percent over the entire 2000 to 2013 period for the older population. While unemployment rose for the
  older population, they were lower than the rates of younger adults (aged 25 to 54) in each of the four countries.
  South Korea did not experience sharp fluctuations in unemployment for the population aged 25 to 54 through-
  out the period. Unemployment rates among younger adults largely flattened in the United Kingdom after 2009
  and continued to rise in Portugal after 2008, reaching 15.5 percent in 2013. The lack of notable improvement
  in unemployment rates in Portugal and the United Kingdom likely reflect the subsequent public debt crisis and
  implementation of austerity measures in Europe, in contrast to a decline in U.S. unemployment after 2010.

  The retirement plans and wealth of the older population in the countries most impacted by the Great
  Recession were also affected by the declines in asset prices—in particular housing and financial investments.
  In Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain, for example, real housing prices declined by 25 percent or more
  (International Monetary Fund, 2015). In the United States, housing prices also declined although older Americans
  tended to have greater equity accumulated prior to the housing collapse than did younger home owners (West et
  al., 2014). One study focused on American preretirees aged 53 to 58 in 2006 found that their net housing wealth
  declined by 23 percent in real terms between 2006 and 2010, although their total wealth declined only 2.8 per-
  cent from 2006 to 2010 (Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai, 2012).

  While the Great Recession had a major impact on unemployment rates even among the older population, the
  trend of rising labor force participation rates among people aged 60 and older in more developed countries was

   69, and 70 to 74 accelerated in more than half of the 20 countries since the onset of the Great Recession (Burtless
   and Bosworth, 2013). The trend of a labor force participation rate increase for workers aged 60 and over slowed
   significantly in only three of the 20 countries—Greece, Portugal, and Ireland—countries that experienced particu-
   larly severe recessions (ibid). Overall, the Great Recession motivated some older workers to postpone retirement
   and drew others back into the labor force.

   Lastly, given the many modifications to world social security systems observed between 2008 and 2013
   (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2013), one may ask whether the Great Recession pro-
   vided a catalyst for such changes. The answer is not entirely straightforward. Many social security systems were
   quite generous and financially unsustainable before the Great Recession and likely in need of reform even if the
   recession had not occurred (Capretta, 2007). However, the Great Recession may have contributed to the substan-
   tial reform packages introduced in OECD countries and helped to revise thinking about who should be covered
   and what is affordable (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2013).

   Note: For example, the labor force participation rate of 65- to 69-year-olds increased at an average rate of 0.1
   percentage point per year between 1989 and 2007 but at an average rate of 0.8 percentage point a year between
   2007 and 2012 for the 20 sample countries.

  Box 6-2.
  A Second Demographic Dividend?—Age Structure, Savings, and Economic Growth
  As fertility falls, a “demographic dividend” of more rapid economic growth might be achieved due to a higher
  proportion of the population at working ages (Chapter 3) and increased labor force participation of women.
  Conversely, the proportions of children and older adults—who tend to consume economic resources rather
  than produce them—will be lower. Yet the window of opportunity for reaping this potential benefit from
  changing age structure is temporary, and there is no guarantee that it will be reaped. Moreover, as fertility
  remains low for a long time, this initial dividend will dissipate as the large cohort of workers reaches older
  ages (Chapters 2 and 3).

  However, a second demographic dividend might also occur as a population ages and the age structure once
  again changes. Given longer expected lives and diminished traditional family support due to fewer children,
  workers may attempt to save more and accumulate additional assets in preparation for their retirement
  (Bloom, Canning, and Graham, 2003; Bloom et al., 2007). That extra savings and an increase in capital per
  worker due to a shrinking labor force may lead to rapid economic growth in contrast to the pessimistic view
  of the labor force shrinking, per capita income declining, and consumption and welfare falling (Mason and
  Lee, 2006; Bloom and Canning, 2008).

  The opportunity to achieve the second demographic dividend will exist for many countries, but the realiza-
  tion of that dividend will depend on how consumption of the older population is supported—through savings
  or borrowing, governmental transfers, or family transfers (Bloom and Canning, 2008). Economic policies that
  encourage workers to save and accumulate assets such as housing, businesses, and funded pensions will be
  important. A developed financial system and access to global markets are key to providing opportunities for
  workers to achieve financial independence in old age and reduce reliance on families and the government. If
  governments choose to increase PAYGO public pensions in response to population aging, then this will coun-
  ter saving incentives and substantially increase the burden on younger generations (ibid.).

  Japan, one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world due to a dramatic decline in fertility in the 1950s
  and mortality improvements that have placed Japan ahead of nearly all other countries in terms of life expec-
  tancy, is the first Asian country to begin reaping the second demographic dividend. The second dividend
  contributions to growth in Japan were high in the 1980s (adding nearly 1.5 percentage points to economic
  growth), while in more recent years the benefits are more modest—adding about 0.5 percentage point to
  growth (Ogawa et al., 2010). The traditional family support system is disappearing due to fewer children and
  increased public pension benefits. One statistic illustrates the change—in 1950 nearly two-thirds of Japanese
  married women said they intended to rely on their children for old age support but in 2000 only 11 percent
  expected to depend on their children (Ogawa, Kondo, and Matsukura, 2005). While Japan has increased
  spending in support of the aging population, the government has set a ceiling of 45 percent of national
  income for the tax burden for financial social security programs (ibid). The government hopes that increas-
  ing financial literacy rates among adults in Japan will further increase life cycle saving among workers and
  continue the second demographic dividend (Ogawa et al., 2010).

  Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Pensions in Selected African Countries
  Unlike the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution systems in some parts of the world, in some
  African countries such as Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia, the trend has been away from defined contribution
  toward defined benefit or toward a combination of both (Stewart and Yermo, 2009). The nascent pension sys-
  tems set up in former British colonies in Africa following independence were primarily defined benefit plans
  limited to civil servants and defined contribution provident funds for workers in the formal sector (Kpessa,
  2010). Coverage was limited, and family and community were the primary sources of support in old age.
  However, with changing expectations and concerns about administrative management of large lump sum
  payouts, the steady stream of pension income under a more traditional defined benefit plan has become a
  more attractive option. This is especially so given the high fertility in Africa under which PAYGO financing is
  most viable.

  Ghana provides an illustration of such reforms. In years past, the primary mandatory pension system was
  called the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), which covered most civil servants and some
  workers in the private sector. The SSNIT relied on a partially funded PAYGO system with features of both
  defined benefit and defined contribution. A special feature allowed workers to collect 25 percent of their
  earned pension in a lump sum at the time of retirement (Steward and Yermo, 2009). As in many other African
  societies, however, coverage under the system is very low, only about 10 percent of the labor force. Although
  coverage remains very low today, a series of reforms implemented in 2010 helped to address inadequacies in
  the system for those who are covered. Workers are fully vested in a defined benefits program at age 60 with
  15 years of service. Contribution rates are 5.5 percent of wages for employees and 13 percent for employers
  (Social Security Administration, 2013a). The lump sum payment of 25 percent of the pension at retirement
  was eliminated. The pension is 37.5 percent of the highest earnings over a 3-year period, with an additional
  1.125 percent of earnings for each year worked beyond 15 years. In addition to early retirement provisions,
  those with insufficient years of service receive a lump sum. A smaller mandatory occupational pension
  scheme based on defined contributions and offering a lump sum payout covers another portion of workers
  (Stewart and Yermo, 2009). The Informal Sector Fund, established in 2008, consists of defined contribution
  schemes that are voluntary, based on individual contributions, and have no fixed contribution rate. These
  schemes target informal sector workers and as of 2013, there were 2 million participants (Van Dam, 2014).

  In contrast, Nigeria appears to have moved in the opposite direction, setting up a Chilean style system
  of mandatory individual retirement accounts in 2004 known as the Contributory Pension Scheme (Social
  Security Administration, 2013a). However, the new system has suffered problems similar to those experi-
  enced in other countries with the Chilean model, such as higher administrative costs compared to PAYGO
  systems and relatively low payouts (Ojonugwa, Isaiah, and Longinus, 2013). Given the potential drawbacks
  of both defined benefit and defined contribution systems, as well as the critical need for good governance
  and administration of both systems, some have suggested that Nigerian authorities consider a “social pen-
  sion” for the older population based on general tax revenues, much of which would be financed from profits
  in the oil industry (Casey and Dostal, 2008).

  Box 7-2.
  Chile’s Second Round of Pension Reform
  Chile’s government appointed a council to review the pension system and recommend new reforms. The
  series of reforms enacted in 2008 were intended to increase participation rates, lower administrative costs,
  and improve the adequacy of pension benefits for all (Shelton, 2012). In order to address the issue of cover-
  age, participation of self-employed workers was transitioned from voluntary to mandatory.

  Several of the reforms focused on reducing the multiple, high administrative fees that participants faced.
  Prior to the 2008 reforms, the five pension fund management companies (Administradoras de Fondos de
  Pension) charged an average of 1.71 percent of earnings and several of the companies also charged fixed
  monthly fees (Kritzer, 2008). Reforms eliminated the monthly fixed administrative fees. The pension fund
  management companies now must bid and compete to manage the contributions of new labor force entrants
  with the selection going to the company submitting the lowest fees. The company must then maintain that
  fee for 24 months and offer the same low fee to all its account holders. Another change allowed insurance
  companies to set up fund management companies to compete with the existing companies. Reforms also
  gradually increased the share of foreign investments allowed to 80 percent of assets, up from 45 percent.

  The council concluded that Chile’s individual account system was working well for middle- and upper-wage
  earners who were regular contributors, but those who did not make regular contributions or made minimal
  contributions did not fare well (James, Edwards, and Iglesias, 2010). Thus, another pillar was added, Pension
  Basica Solidariato, to provide a basic pension to those who had not contributed to individual accounts or who
  would receive an inadequate pension based on their individual account balances.

  Reforms also sought to address gender inequities. Women had been particularly disadvantaged because
  of their shorter work history, lower earnings, and greater participation in the informal sector, which is not
  covered by the pension system. Women’s pensions were 30 to 40 percent less than men’s (Kritzer, 2008).
  The 2008 reforms introduced a pension bonus for each child that a woman had and the bonus will be added
  to her regular retirement pension when she reaches age 65. In addition, all widowers are now eligible for a
  survivor pension.

    Notes:
    For some countries in this table, data are derived from labor force surveys as well as population censuses. Labor force surveys are more focused on economic
activity than are general census enumerations and, therefore, may yield more comprehensive information on various aspects of economic activity. The user should
recognize that temporal differences in labor force participation rates within a country may, in part, reflect different modes of data collection.
    Czech Republic: Data prior to 1991 refer to the former Czechoslovakia.
    Germany: Data prior to 1996 refer to the former West Germany.
    United Kingdom: Data for 2000 and 2006 are averages of reported quarterly rates.
