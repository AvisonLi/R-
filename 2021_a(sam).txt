Abstract
The second King’s College London Symposium on Ageing and Long-term Care in China was convened from 4 to 5th July 2019 at
King’s College London in London. The aim of the Symposium was to have a better understanding of health and social challenges
for aging and long-term care in China. This symposium draws research insights from a wide range of disciplines, including eco-
nomics, public policy, demography, gerontology, public health and sociology. A total of 20 participants from eight countries, seek
to identify the key issues and research priorities in the area of aging and long-term care in China. The results published here are a
synthesis of the top four research areas that represent the perspectives from some of the leading researchers in the field.
