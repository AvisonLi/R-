Abstract
This paper examines the links between place attachment and older persons’ preferences to age in place, and factors that disrupt
these preferences. We use data from the 2001–2021 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey and panel-
data modelling to conﬁrm strong associations between several place attachment dimensions and aging-in-place preferences.
Strong ties to children, strong social capital, residence in social housing, homeownership status, housing wealth, and home and
neighborhood satisfaction are all positively linked to a stronger preference to age in place. Our ﬁndings reveal important
differences between older homeowners and older non-owners. For owners, closeness to children is a strong predictor of aging-
in-place preferences, although mortgage debt can trigger involuntary moves. For non-owners, tenure security achieved through
longer durations at one’s address of residence is linked to stronger aging-in-place preferences. However, private renters are
more often exposed to involuntary moves. We discuss the policy implications of these disruptions.

  While not reported in the table, the model predictors include the full range of model covariates listed in supplemental material table S1. Refer to supplemental
material table S2 for the complete model results.

  Levels of home equity are determined by ranking all homeowner households in HILDA each wave by their home equity and dividing into tertiles. Individual
members of our modelling sample are then allocated their corresponding household equity tertile within each wave.
